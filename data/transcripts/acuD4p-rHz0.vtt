and
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
um I want to start off with uh um
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury representative
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and representative Ames have
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh been working on this to see if we
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
need an amendment or what we need to do
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
with this um and uh we'll start with uh
 
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury and then go to
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative Ames thank you Mr
 
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.230 align:start position:0%
representative Ames thank you Mr
chairman

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that the bill is introduced
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
by Senator Ganon was adequate in its own
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
way and that uh there are two different
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
issues that have become
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
confused that unless we're told
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise this morning by our visitors I
 
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
think we can strip them back
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
away the first issue
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
is who exactly which entity requires an
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
exemption from the licensing
 
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.550 align:start position:0%
exemption from the licensing
requirements

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
and the bill that as it was introduced
 
00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
was that a non-member
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
individual which is to say an outside
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer who's not a member of this
 
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
organization having the
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
auction can conduct the the auction
 
00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
without a license for that
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
organization I think that's
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward when you look at the
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
existing statute that this is proposing
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
to amend that's RSA 3
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
B13 that statute is within the statute
 
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
that um authorizes licensing of
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
auctioneers and it says very simply that
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
a member of a charitable
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
organization can conduct an auction
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
without a license so this is adding to
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
that that existing provision identifies
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
the entities and this leads us to the
 
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.670 align:start position:0%
the entities and this leads us to the
second

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
question the existing St statute 311
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
B13 says any that that a a member
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
individual of a charitable organization
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
educational religious or other
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and Senator Ganon uses the
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
exact same phrase charitable educational
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
religious or other nonprofit
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
organization in the existing statute as
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill there's no effort to
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
further Define charitable educational
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
religious or nonprofit
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
organization they are broadly used
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
generic terms and I think that's because
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
the intention of the existing statute
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
was to be sweeping and to allow for all
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
of them um so I don't think there was
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
any need to define those terms and the
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
existing statute has operated without
 
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
objection even though those terms are
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
not defined so the second element of
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
confusion that's entered our
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
discussion is that the Senate amended
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
their own bill and we've received it
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
with this phrase in line
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
four if eligible under RSA 721
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
Tob so the Senate's Amendment introduced
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
a cross reference to a statute that
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
defines uh nonprofit
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
organizations and when it came to us we
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
then started to say wait a minute what
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
about fraternal organizations what about
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
religious groups what about
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
churches so if if you were to wade back
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
in and examine what did representative
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
jian's Amendment do what did
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's Amendment uh
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
propose to do
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
Etc they are trying to address these two
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
forms of confusion and it turns out I
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
believe that when you when you realize
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
that the broad phrasing charitable
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
education religious or other nonprofit
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
is identical to the existing statute
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
that this is being added
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
to and hasn't required definition we
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
could very simply my
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
opinion amend the Senate bill to remove
 
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
the phrase if eligible under RSA 721
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
Tob and just let the terms charitable
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
educational religious or other nonprofit
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
organization stand on their own they're
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
plain language they can be interpreted
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
without having to be defined as terms of
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
art okay and then this leaves us with
 
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
the original intent that the subject of
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
this whole thing is non-member
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
individuals you can hire an outsider to
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
conduct your auction without his needing
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
a license for that purpose
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
concur I would say we could get a very
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
simple Amendment drawn this morning to
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
remove the Senate Amendment and go back
 
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you and thank you for your
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
your work on this um over the past few
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
days representative Ames would you like
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.949 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
well first uh thank you to
 
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I agree with what he said um and um
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
the um it's really if you step back from
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
this this
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
is this is a
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
um should be a non-controversial
 
00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:58.519 align:start position:0%
um amendment that uh responds to a gap
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
in the allance for uh non-licensed
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
people to conduct
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
auctions um and it does so without
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
disturbing the protections that are
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
already in the statute uh
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
for uh situations that currently are
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
allowed for auctioneering by
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
non-licensed people in uh uh in the
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
situation where they two are members of
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
the charity that or the uh charity where
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
the auction is being held
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh so this expands that and has all the
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
safeguards in it um and it it shouldn't
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
be that difficult I think one thing
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's hampered our dealing with this
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
and our um is that we really had no a
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
substantive testimony that gave us uh
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
context to work on this bill and this
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
certainly is not our field of expertise
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
we're sort of dealing with a subject
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
that has to do with license that usually
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't come this way so uh we've had to
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
wrestle with that too but putting that
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
all that aside it it's a simple matter
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we uh I I agree that uh we should
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
use the language that's already in the
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
statute for that narrower group that's
 
00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
already authorized to provide
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
auctioneering services in a very narrow
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
context and use that language charitable
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
educational religious or other a
 
00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.829 align:start position:0%
educational religious or other a
nonprofit

00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
organization uh to uh Define the arena
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
within which uh the unlicensed
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
individual may may function and um and
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh fix the language and go forward and
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh the simple fix is to go back to the
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
original bill as
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
filed um and um or to amend this bill as
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
it came to us and and write in that
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
language and uh to me that would be
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
sufficient so I I agree really entirely
 
00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
with what uh was
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
proposed thank you representative Ames
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh both for working on this
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
over the past few days diligently I
 
00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yes just I I had I had
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
noted that we didn't have any
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
substantive testimony but we did have a
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh a letter from Senator Ganon that uh
 
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
got submerged underneath all the other
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
stuff that comes in and didn't come to
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
our attention until uh we started
 
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
working on it this weekend um and it's a
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
a good explanation of the context and
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
the background of regulation for
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
auctioner and services that exists uh so
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
I just want to point that out I think
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
you all have received that yes thank you
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes every everyone should have received
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
that in their email it's a roughly a
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
two-page uh letter from Senator Ganon um
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
so with that I would just like to um uh
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
first mention that on very short notice
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
um we um have
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh read the last name correctly uh Al Al
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
buyers um who is um one of the
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
um original proponents of of this and
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
also Michael Haley from the uh doj trust
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
division here to um to just kind of
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
here if they think that uh what What's
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
just been proposed to go back to the
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
original Bill not amended um so first
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to invite up ay if you could
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
come up and tell us your thoughts on
 
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.110 align:start position:0%
come up and tell us your thoughts on
that

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
she you'll introduce
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
herself hi so I'm ay buers um I work
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
with Senator Ganon on this bill um I am
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
a licensed Auctioneer working here in
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and um to
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
give a slight background the impetus for
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
creating this bill is that if you which
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
you guys wouldn't need to do if you were
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
to look through all the rules and
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
regulations of what an auctioneering
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
license requires and what it is designed
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
to do it's designed to protect the
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
seller of items as we traditionally
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
think of auctions so it's a matter of
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
how the funds are transferred from the
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
buyer to the seller the timeline that
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
happens in how the advertising happens
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
the care custody and control of the
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
items from when you take them from the
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
seller to when they're delivered to the
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
buyer um the records that are kept for
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
the sale and um if there's any question
 
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
about the items or the property with the
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
buyer the funds are put into escrow and
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
held in a place until the resolution is
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
taken care of if you are working with a
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and doing a nonprofit
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
fundraising event for instance easy
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
thought you're going to the animal
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
shelter at your hometown and someone is
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
providing services to raise funds for
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
that the person providing the
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
auctioneering services never takes
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
control of any item never is in any care
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
cuty in control of any of the funds
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
never is in control of any of the
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
advertising and never really has
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge or control of where the items
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
are coming from and never has records
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
about where the items are going to so
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
the laws we have in place don't really
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
apply in any way shape or form to
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
someone providing auctioning services to
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit hence the idea of removing
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
those individuals from being covered
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
under requiring an auctioneering license
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
because the laws don't really apply to
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
what they're actually providing for
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
services the creation of the bill was
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
incredibly simplistic to mimic as you
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
said the current description of what it
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
was it's basically nonprofits all of us
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
in our head probably think 501c3 is and
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
six it's basically what it meant to be
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
so we just copied the current RSA
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
regulations um I understand potentially
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
why they wanted to clarify what New
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire views as a nonprofit but as
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
you said it's kind of redundant because
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's already what the original RSA and
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations state in 100
 
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
through 500 and that's never been
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
clarified um and again it uh the current
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
rules say if you're a member of the
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
organization you wouldn't have to have a
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
license but there is a growing body of
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
professionals like myself who travel
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
around the country and work solely for
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and therefore um we are paid
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
on a flat fee most of us are paid on a
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
flat fee basis to provide those services
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
and we would not be members of the
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
organization they would choose us for
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
our abilities and to execute what they
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
need taken care of at their event to
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
raise the most amount of
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
funds thank you um yes rep uh
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
representa to go to the the law what
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
would prevent you from advising someone
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
how to run an auction and letting
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
someone someone in the charity run it
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing I do that with some
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
groups I go in and just do the
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
Consulting and I don't actually execute
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
the auction
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay so you wouldn't be covered follow
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
followup then
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
so this this laws as proposed wouldn't
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
really affect you would it no this law
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
is for those individuals that show up at
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
the actual event and execute um a live
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
auction component or what would
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
potentially also be covered under the
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
auctioning law of an appeal where you
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's a a request for cash from people in
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
the organization so if you are not if
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit is not doing an auction
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
component then it wouldn't it wouldn't
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
matter and if you were just Consulting
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
with a nonprofit it wouldn't affect you
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
either so there are fundraising
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
Consultants that are just hired for
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
their expertise and then someone else
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
performs the actions at the event thank
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury yes thank you
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
very much I think that was a good clear
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
description shows how simple this really
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
is um I would just point out that all of
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Amendments all of the confusion have
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
related exclusively to the first
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
sentence sentences the 2nd through the
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
6th essentially Echo the
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
stipulations why it is we that we aren't
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
requiring a uh a license because the
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
auctioneer is not handling the seller's
 
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.750 align:start position:0%
auctioneer is not handling the seller's
Goods

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
Goods
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
Etc thank you representa um Aly
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to get clear on the
 
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.669 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to get clear on the
language

00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
here on does not allow someone who is
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
not an Auctioneer anywhere to um to do
 
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.149 align:start position:0%
not an Auctioneer anywhere to um to do
the

00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
auction so under the current law if a
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofit was
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
to hire an individual I.E pay a person
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
to perform the auction at their event
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
non-licensed one that individual would
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
be subject to the New Hampshire Board of
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
auctioneers disciplinary actions and two
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit could potentially be
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
subject to some sort of problem because
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
they were using a non-licensed person it
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
also technically according to the rsas
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
and rules regulations the nonprofit
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
as the the rules and regulation State
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
putting the lure number if they if they
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
were to hire an auctioner license
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer licensed individual put all
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
that information on their advertising
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
which none of them do because the
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
auctioneer is not the important part of
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
the event it's the raising funds for the
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofit so it's also creating removing
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
some technical barriers that the
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofits should be
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
doing follow up yes
 
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
um if I am a member of a nonprofit that
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
has never done an auction before right
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
and I read this
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
language uh within the cont context of
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
the rest of the auction Heering on am I
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to understand that without a
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
license for that
 
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.789 align:start position:0%
license for that
organization

00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
means that I don't need that the person
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
who's going to be doing the
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
auctioneering doesn't have to have a
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
license as an auctioneer correct so but
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
is is that clear from that language cuz
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
me I would have a hard time answering
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
that because I've been licensed in the
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
state for 12 years so I've been in this
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
for so long um but I think
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
for a decent amount of nonprofits in the
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire they are aware of
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that either it has to be a
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
member of their
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
organization that has to be someone
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
that's licensed or they could they could
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
have a person who was non-licensed and
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
non-member but they could not receive
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
any compensation including a meal they
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
could not receive anything of value to
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
auction is what it currently is a system
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah first I just wanted to point
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
out out that there are consequences uh
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
right in this statute for um a um for
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
performing auctioneering Services
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
outside of uh The
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
Lure um Arrangement that's allowed by
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
the set for set out by the statute or
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
the exception to it for the member of a
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
charal organization and one of those
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
consequences is uh any person V
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
violating the provisions of uh this RSA
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
and not
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
exempt that's the membership exempt
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
exemption shall be guilty of a
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor yep so it's uh you know
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
definitely a consequence and then um I
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
would say that uh you just have to bear
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
in mind that this is a narrow exception
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
that the member who who was allowed to
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
do an auction um
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
is subject
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
to limitations I'm looking at the
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
existing statute that's already in this
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
statute um that this
 
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
statute um that this
individual

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
um does must not take physical or legal
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
possession of goods being sold must not
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
collect or transmit payment for
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
transactions uh there are a bunch of of
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
Provisions I won't go through them all
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh so it's tightly contained
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to say yes exactly
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking this
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
question does the suggestion by
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
in which line is that representative
 
00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:19.470 align:start position:0%
in which line is that representative
spillsbury

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
for pardon me uh to remove the citation
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
in line four if eligible under RSA 721
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
Tob would that address what you have
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
us yes I you know as a person that
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
helped draft the original version I've
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
we intentionally copied the original
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
language so I feel it's very
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh yes representative Aly
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um we have one of the Amendments
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
that were suggested by people here
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
before on on reads and I'll take out the
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
RSA language non-member individuals
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
without an auctioneering license may be
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
hired by any charitable educational re
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
religious or other nonprofit
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
organization for auctioneering services
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
for charity auctions for that
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
organization is that what we're talking
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
about yes because that's a lot clearer
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
for an amateur that's what we yes that
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
about

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
that I would I would uh defer to
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative Ames and representative
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
spillsbury on that because they're um
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
they've analyzed this both being lawyers
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
um we'll also hear from Michael Haley
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
from the trust division representative
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
spillsbury you want just a reaction
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
representative Aly
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think that uh the language in
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um Amendment also
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
works but it also includes that
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
reference to RSA 721 that has to be
 
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
removed so why not just stick with the
 
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.830 align:start position:0%
removed so why not just stick with the
Senate

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
bill I don't understand
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
microphone because I don't understand it
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
and uh my
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
Democratic party on many years ago now
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
so it's passed statute of limitations on
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
got someone who was not a licensed
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer to do an auction for us we
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
never did one again uh she was excellent
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
but um but um I would I read this over
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
and over again and I couldn't figure out
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
which organization they didn't have to
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
have a license from the
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
original represent
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
fellows yes I I'd just like to respond
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
to that and say
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that the sentence is poorly
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
structured but
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
so but it's a copy of the stat the um
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
exception that's right above that that's
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the members so the the this language
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
wasn't invented for this bill it was
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
copied from um the T the two you know
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
this is 2A it's a it's just a slightly
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
amended version of
 
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.149 align:start position:0%
amended version of
two

00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
so while while my thought was when I
 
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
began you know that that the sentence
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
could be better written so could the
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
sentence that's in section two and then
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
you start then you're going down the
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
because then people are going to say why
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
are they not worded the same does it
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
mean something different and this
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
situation exists all throughout our
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
statutes that things are not really
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
worded very well but I I'm
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I I certainly want to hear from the
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office but um
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
focusing just on what statutes should be
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
referenced in um line four I think it's
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
what we should just focus on right now
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
and not try to rewrite the
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
sentence I think that's why the proposal
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
is to remove that statute reference
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
there and go back to the original bill
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
Hy okay seeing none thank you very much
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming on such short
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
notice uh literally she was asked
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon thank
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
up uh thank you Mr chair and um
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members uh my name
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
is Michael Haley I am the director of
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts at the Department of
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
Justice um when this bill was originally
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
proposed um we didn't uh have any
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
particular objection to it and we first
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
reached out when we saw the Senate
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment and our concern there was just
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
that it might create some confusion
 
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
about which groups were were eligible we
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
don't take a position on the bill um and
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
my specific concern was that the the
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
existing statute referenced um
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
referenced religious organizations it
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
referenced other nonprofits and many of
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
those are not Charities as defined in
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
the statute that was referenced so I
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
thought it just might create some
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
confusion about who was eligible um
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
under our uh statute um you're a charity
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
if you are a 501c3 or if you hold
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
yourself out to be a charity or if you
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh engage in fundraising for a
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose from the public um
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
and that's that's unfortunately
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
different from what the IRS defines to
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
be a charity it's different than what
 
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission defines to be a
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
charity it's different than what the
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
municipal um groups Define to be a
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
charity so introducing a fifth
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
definition of charity seemed like it
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
just might create a lot of confusion um
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that there's any
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
confusion with the original wording um
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
and all I wanted to be here today was is
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
to um make sure that that the groups
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill was um permitting to
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
engage in this activity were the groups
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
that the legislature was intending so
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a broad range of
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that are not Charities the
 
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
IRS recognizes um more than uh 20 almost
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
30 different types of nonprofit
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
organizations and only one of those is
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
Charities um so membership organizations
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
um the c6s that were just mentioned the
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
veterans groups um labor unions
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
agricultural groups some credit unions
 
00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:38.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different types of
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um so as worded uh this bill
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
would allow any of them to engage in an
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
auction and if that's uh what the
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
committee is is looking to do um I
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take any position on
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you so um do you agree that
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
if we take out the reference to the RSA
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
and go back to the original unamended
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill the intent is still there
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
that would not be confusing as far as
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned to Simply remove that
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
statutory reference okay thank you
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
representative PL who took the question
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
out of my
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
mouth okay uh represent
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
fellows uh thank you so so I understand
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
the original bill um what what you're
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
saying included Charities but it also
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
included more than what we call
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
Charities can you help me um with
 
00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
Charities can you help me um with
line

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
one U because it says charity auctions
 
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.509 align:start position:0%
one U because it says charity auctions
by

00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofits yeah oh thank you for the
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
question um so yes they're charity
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
auctions by uh nonprofit corporations so
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh nonprofit corporations at least in
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are any organization
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's um organized under chapter 292
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's the the New Hampshire statute
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
that allows the formation of nonprofits
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
and you can form a nonprofit for
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
charitable purposes but you can per a
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofit for many other different um
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
purposes as well um that are not uh
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
included so um for example C4s um which
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
are the social welfare organizations um
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
c6s membership organizations things like
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
the the Elks Club those are all
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofits but they're not Charities um
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
and this because of the way this bill is
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
worded any other nonprofit organization
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
um any of those types of organizations
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to uh to would be
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
covered under this statute even if they
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
were not a charity as defined in 721
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so so I'm I'm asking
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
you what words do you think we should
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
have in line one and and I'm not
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
entirely sure about for the
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
statutes will that I'm concerned that
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
that word charity is in there because
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
some of these things are are not
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
Charities and we could just say for
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporations accept that I
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
know that the churches are not nonprofit
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
organizations so do you understand the
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you for the than you
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
for clarifying um so uh charity our
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
churches are nonprofits but they are not
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
Charities under the the state statute um
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
I believe uh and I'm not an expert in
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
this but I believe that the line one
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
would not ultimately show up in the the
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
chapter uh in or in in the um the law as
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's as it amends the rsas is that
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
corre up so and it's also in the title
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
though um so as far as which
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
organizations are eligible to conduct
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
these auctions um I don't think that the
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
the word charity auction introduces any
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
confusion into which organizations are
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
eligible because the language below is
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear about who would be
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
this yes R Aly thank you on this
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
language uh line one and the title are
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
created by the
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
drafters it is exceedingly hard to get
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the drafters to change something that is
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
totally ER
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
erroneous

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
erroneous
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry what um represent me what
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
was your concern no it isn't a concern
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's that this is not a concern because
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's not we would have to go to alakus
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
and get him to talk to the drafter and
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
get him to change his language it's not
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill it is the description by
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
OSS okay um representative
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
Ames oh no okay representative
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
Erie thank
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned those um entities that
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
are organized under 292 there are some
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
entities that do charitable work that
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
aren't organized under 292 because
 
00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:21.790 align:start position:0%
aren't organized under 292 because
they're

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
organized under the
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
IRS and there's a section I forget the
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
chck chapter and verse it says that if
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're federally
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
organized you don't have to be State
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
organized that's the state law as
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
well it's in the banking
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
code sure so um so 292 RSA chapter 292
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
is the statute that that creates The
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
Entity and the IRS grants tax exempt
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
status to existing entities so most uh
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are formed as a as a
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
corporation or as a another type of
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
entity you can be formed as
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
um some of the uh some of the
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
associations um are not formed as
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
corporations I was unfortunately
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
shanding that a little bit but there are
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
there are organizations that are um
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
unincorporated associations they're not
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
formed under 292 but they have an IRS
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
tax exempt
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
status so follow up
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
Sir would we the need to put in or
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
having an IRS tax exempt status in there
 
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.829 align:start position:0%
having an IRS tax exempt status in there
someplace

00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
I I or would we be then requiring
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
everyone to become organized even though
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
their Charter says they can't become
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
organized I'm thinking of the fraternal
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
organizations yeah I I I think um thank
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
you for the question that might create
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
more confusion because churches are not
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh often they don't often get a tax
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
exempt status from the IRS they simply
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
can operate without it so that could
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
make it uh there some some Churches do
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
seek tax exempt status and receive it
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
some choose not to um and it's it's up
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
to the church whether to seek it so that
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
could creat some confusion about who's
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
eligible you follow up on that follow up
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
you're aware that every organization is
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
now required to file the
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
1099 or excuse me a u yeah an EIN they
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
have to obtain an EIN number and file a
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
tax return every year every
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
organization uh whether they're
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
religious or not so federal tax laws is
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
not my my specialty it's my
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh there are churches
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
who do not uh do not seek a tax
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
exemption from the IRS and so if that
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
would be the the basis for granting this
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh for uh allowing this um this
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
auctioning to to occur that it might
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
inadvertently exclude certain churches
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
that you that the legislation was
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
intending to allow um simply removing
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
the reference to to RSA 7 21 um I think
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
makes uh would be pretty clear about
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
who's eligible because it encompasses
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
charitable educational religious or
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
other nonprofit
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
organizations thank you representative
 
00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.030 align:start position:0%
organizations thank you representative
spillsbury

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
so again to to attempt to simplify and
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
clarify in the way that I
 
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.349 align:start position:0%
clarify in the way that I
began

00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
began
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
um the existing statute that we're
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
amending will sound very
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
familiar 311 B13
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
2 says any Resident member of a
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
charitable educational religious or
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
other nonprofit organization within the
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
state may conduct a charity auction
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
without a license for that
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
organization so really all we're trying
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
to do is saying say in addition to a
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
resident member also a
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
nonmember okay that's all we're trying
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
to do so any
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
departure from that same
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
phrasing just introduces confusion
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
because it the question why did the
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
legislature mean something different by
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
choosing different words so let's not go
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
there um I'm going to use the word wide
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
and narrow in the same sentence here I
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
think representative Ames accurately
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
said this has a relatively narrow
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
purpose but the phrasing in terms of the
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
organizations charitable educational
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
religious or other nonprofit is Broad
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
it's intended to be sweep
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
so I think all of the concerns regarding
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
the definition of church or fraternal
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and youits of Columbus and
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
so on are included in this broad phrase
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
any effort to further amend it actually
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
works against that purpose and and I
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
think that's why the introduction if of
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate Amendment became
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
confusing the Senate Amendment 721 2B
 
00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
that's the statute that defines
 
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.109 align:start position:0%
that's the statute that defines
charitable

00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
organization so inclusion of that phrase
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
just seemed to reverse the idea of being
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
Broad and inclusive and go to narrow it
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
okay so I I hope I believe uh Mr Haley
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
has said everything that I agreed with
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
and uh confirms what I'm saying if we
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
just go back to the original as
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
introduced language all of this
 
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.950 align:start position:0%
introduced language all of this
confusion

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
disappears uh thank you for the question
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's my um as far as I am
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
concerned um removing the if eligible
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
under RSA 7212 be language um removes
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
confusion um for me and does not uh make
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
it uh unclear to me which organizations
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
would be eligible to
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
participate thank you um I'm just going
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
to take one more question I think we we
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
keep circling around and coming back to
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
the same conclusion at this point yes
 
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.230 align:start position:0%
the same conclusion at this point yes
represent

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman I am um
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
more confused now than I was at the
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
beginning um I have a real problem with
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
using the term charity
 
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
using the term charity
because

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure what we're talking about
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
with Charity if educational institutions
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
or any other institution comes along
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
let's say a for-profit school that comes
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
along and says we are having a charity
 
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
auction and because it says educational
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
institution can be included in here um
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
to me that that the term charity is a
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
contradiction so uh at this point um
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
barring a last
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
minute Epiphany I'll be voting against
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
you uh represent Ames just a comment on
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
that the uh the only
 
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.750 align:start position:0%
that the uh the only
organizations

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
that could
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
host an auction by
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
a non-licensed person under this
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
proposed change are nonprofits by the
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
text of this bill non-member individuals
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
hired by a charitable educational
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
organization um okay I want to wrap it
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
up representative PL you have something
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
to yes I'm going to ask representative
 
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.270 align:start position:0%
to yes I'm going to ask representative
spillsbury

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
if we struck the word charity in uh uh
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
line one and then Below on line five
 
00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
struck charity would affect anything I
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
represent PL I believe that um that is
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
not part of this uh bill that's
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
just a reference is that what is part of
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
this bill well I I can answer both those
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay the caption charity auctions I
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
think is just using a term of phrase in
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
common usage right and that's not the
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
statute what what what lines one and two
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
are saying is insert the next paragraph
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
right so the statute is lines uh 3 to 10
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
here right so uh represent elberger to
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
that point does that make it easier for
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
you to accept this where that's just
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
reference to where this is going to be
 
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.790 align:start position:0%
reference to where this is going to be
placed

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
placed
 
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
and not you
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
know okay all right uh represent Ames
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then we will and I I probably
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't open my mouth
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
um since we seem to be just about there
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
but in line five the the charity
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
auctions concept does reemerge and uh I
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
just want to point that out and say that
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
I think uh it it would be construed by
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
anyone who needed to construe this as
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
being as the word being used in its
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
uh in its sort of definitional sense
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
common definitional sense as a CH it's
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
it's not to uh make more money for the
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
organization that's uh hosting the
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
auction but it's to promote a charity or
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose that uh can be
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
defined it's some general concept but I
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be in there it's uh
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
you don't want to uh
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
allow um I I think the per the drafter
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
of this didn't have in mind allowing
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
auctions to be conducted by unlicensed
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
auctioneers that would uh raise money
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
for the business side of say a nonprofit
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
hospital um you know I think that's I
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
see that my friend down there has some
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm also reluctant to open my mouth but
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
I agree completely with what
 
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ames just said and I
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
would point out that in the existing law
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
the exact same references made May
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
conduct a charity auction without a
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
license yeah there you go thank you
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you Mr Haley
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
you and thank you also for coming on
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
very short notice uh as
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
well um at this point we need uh based
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
on the discussion we need an
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um and I think the consensus
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
is to remove online four if eligible
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA 721
 
00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
Tob um so um while
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
um Jen is that something that you can
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
have drafted um while that's being done
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
um uh suspend I don't know what the
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate word is recess the exec
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
session and um
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
hold on recess the exec session and come
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
back uh after when the bill comes in
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll go into the public hearings
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yeah I would Ju
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
Just like to ask if it won't hold up the
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
process if we could work on the
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
title The the ACT title and change it to
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
Auctioneer license exemption for
 
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofits because this is really we're
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Auctioneer licenses
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that would just to make that more
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
clear I would rather not change the
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
title we can't change the title without
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
going through
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
alonis and him going to the drafter and
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
the drafter agreeing
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
to okay I think that the drafter if we
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
ask for it I as I said if it doesn't
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
hold it
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
up well we could pursue that I it it'll
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
it would hold it up um okay so I am now
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
recess the um the exec session on SB
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
513 um and once that uh Amendment comes
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
through we will reopen the exec session
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
once whatever public hearing we're on is
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
finished um okay so that is recessed
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr Haley and thank you um
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh Al ay for being here appreciate
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.270 align:start position:0%
 
gav

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
gav
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay I'm going to open the public
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:25.589 align:start position:0%
 
472

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lang we now recognize you
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee it's great
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
to be back in Ways and Means again um
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Tim Lang representative district
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
2 um I'm sure this feels like deja vu
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
all over again on this topic um this
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill before you is our historic horse
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
racing and moratorium bill um this time
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
we hold the moratorium at 7 years um
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
extending it out for a period of seven
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
years to give time for the industry to
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
mature to see what we want to do um it
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
also gives time for the charitable
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
gaming commission to do its work and
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to the committee
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
after reviewing the data and and what's
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening within the industry um
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is pretty straightforward again
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
um we add the people who have already
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
applied for licenses in a narrow window
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
of time uh to lienes we then extend the
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium out seven years a new wrinkle
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
to this bill is we've added uh Municipal
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
hosts to be able to act in essence as a
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
charity um but only if there are dates
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
available so the charity gets first bid
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
on the dates if there are dates still
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
available after all the Charities have
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
been serviced it would allow a
 
00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:37.559 align:start position:0%
municipality to be able to hold up to 10
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
days and the revenue the 35% Revenue
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
that would normally go to a charity
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
would go to the municipality offset any
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
local costs um in addition to that um it
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
um it also restricts the transfer of
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
licenses um and I think it's just a
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
restatement of law um as you're all well
 
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
aware you can't sell gaming license in
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you can sell the business
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
but not a license in and of itself
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
outside of the business so this restates
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
that and makes it clear that that is the
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
exact law happy to take questions thank
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
you uh represent
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
ery uh thank you uh Senator
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
Lang the question is New York put
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
similar restrictions on their taxi
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
medallions immediately the value of The
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
medallions immediately the value of The
Medallion

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
Medallion
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.670 align:start position:0%
Medallion
Skyrock

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
Skyrock
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
won't the same thing happen with the
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
value of uh businesses that are engaged
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
in here and th thus restrict trade and
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
make this type of
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
activity um less competitive and more
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
expensive for the consumer so again
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's again why it's a seven-year uh
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
Sunset Clause it allows us to evaluate
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the industry and if
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
we choose to do nothing the moratorium
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
will expire and it'll become a
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
full-blown free market again um
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
however um at this point because it's a
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
pretty significant change in how gaming
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
operates uh this new form of gaming in
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
HHR um we think we need a slight pause
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
to see what's going on to make sure uh
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
make follow up and you're assuming that
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
Lottery is going to keep this data I'm
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
sorry say that question again you're
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that Lottery is going to
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
maintain a database that would provide
 
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.750 align:start position:0%
maintain a database that would provide
the

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
information uh regarding the cost of
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
licenses and the competitive
 
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.549 align:start position:0%
licenses and the competitive
competitivness

00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
competitivness
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of the um business so
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
again so the charitable gaming
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
commission that we established uh last
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
year which is meeting now is one of the
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
topics we're reviewing is exactly that
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
we get the data on what the market can
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
support what the uh Revenue looks like
 
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
we're just we just hired I think the
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
executive Council last week hired the um
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
the uh people were bring in Spectrum
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
gaming the experts were bringing in who
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be doing modeling for New
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as compared to other states
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
and what that looks like but again we
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
don't have that data we will have that
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
data after that analysis is done thank
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
you sir representative
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you for taking my
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
question could you provide a little more
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
context about the availability of the
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
dates because it seemed like at least in
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
some uh fac facilities they get used up
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
very quickly much more competitive so
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering for example if there
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
often will even be anything available
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
for municipalities in some There Will
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
and some they won't um so to your point
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
in in the larger uh charitable Gaming
 
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
facilities those dates probably wouldn't
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
be available um and the smaller ones
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
they tend to be I I tell you that in the
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill when we had this conversation um we
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
had a charity come forward in the Senate
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means hearing um wi Arrow from
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
lonia um and they talked about there was
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
availability right away for dates um
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
through the Belmont uh gaming casino and
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
they went in they did the application
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
they were immediately given a date cuz
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
there were dates available so some of in
 
00:53:07.789 --> 00:53:07.799 align:start position:0%
some cases there will be dates available
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
some cases there won't be so really it's
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
really variable correct thank you
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
represent alink thank you following up
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
on that one I think this is
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
totally impossible you are saying in
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
line8 that it is required that they
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
annually oper operate a minimum of seven
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
but not more than 10 game game dates for
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
the benefit of town or city required and
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
then you go on to say all of the times
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
when they don't want to do it but you've
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
said not withstanding any not provision
 
00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.430 align:start position:0%
said not withstanding any not provision
of

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
Law and I was under the impression that
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
just about nothing except the North
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
Country uh possibly Lebanon at this
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
point because there's this tiny little
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
place that's still operating while
 
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
they're waiting to build the Taj Mahal
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh on our very trafficked Road
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
um is um on has any game dates they've
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
got long waiting
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
lists so how does this work except for
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
maybe in Berlin and possibly
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
lonia again it's where it was available
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh understanding that not every
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming facility is going to
 
00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:28.799 align:start position:0%
have dates I will also tell you that the
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
topic you're look you're talking about
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
relative to um uh Charities and gaming
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
operators again is under provision and
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
purview of the charitable gaming
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
commission they're looking at how those
 
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
Charities are selected how days are
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
selected um again that that commission
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
is is is looking at a lot of topics
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
rather with charitable gaming and how
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
you know we we've to a certain extent
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
we've kind of patch this law as we've
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
gone along and not taken a big picture
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
look um and so uh I would I'll just say
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
to you again the same as I said to
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
represent Southworth it's going to be ad
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
hoc it's going to be sometimes it will
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
be sometimes there won't be there could
 
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
be a charity that was a lotted games
 
00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden on a Tuesday went
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
out of business and now there's a hole
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
in the schedule and they get a lot that
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
time to a town I I I don't know all the
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
conditions and circumstances that a town
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
would be able to get dates other than to
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
say that if there's a hole in the
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
schedule they would be able to plug it
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
with the town to be able to use that as
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
a a a a
 
00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:26.990 align:start position:0%
a a a a
source

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
and and the gaming commission is looking
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
at how Charities are selected and what
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
that looks like representative Aly I've
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
this is just a follow up I do have
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
another question later on one you say
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
required not withstanding any provision
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
of law to the
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
contrary and two there's no uh nothing
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
in here about on what if the town
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't want any of this and didn't want
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
it in the first place like Littleton and
 
00:55:59.599 --> 00:56:00.349 align:start position:0%
it in the first place like Littleton and
like

00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
Lebanon um but has been forced to take
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
it thank you that hadn't come up in any
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
of the hearings I talked about a town
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
was going to refuse Revenue um I hadn't
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
heard that conversation anywhere else I
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
I suppose if you want to amend it to
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
allow an opt out of the Town say we're
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
don't want your money you can do
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
that representative PL describe to me
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
the horribles that might happen if we if
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
we eliminate the
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium so again I I I wouldn't
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
presume to you mean to make it free
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
market as it is right now again I
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't presume to make that guess that
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
Chad gaming commission is working on
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
the the concern was again a
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
proliferation um right now I think I
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
don't know in the most current number
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
the last time I heard about 1,800
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
machines in New Hampshire so far um for
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
HHR um the the question is whether what
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
the proliferation would look like if we
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
had an unrestricted Market again that's
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
part of the chatable Gaming's uh review
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
with uh Spectrum gaming the experts in
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
the field to make that determination for
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
changes uh represent fellows um thank
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can you remind me of when the change
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
was made to say that it could be two
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
Charities on the same date was that just
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
last year or so that was Again part of
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
the original HHR bill which I can't
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
remember I think it was representative
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
duet's bill um or AB abrami I can't
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
remember which it was um that did that
 
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:41.559 align:start position:0%
bill that allowed for two uh charities
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
in a given night one for games of chance
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
HHR repres Aly did you have a question
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
oh yes I I did have another question I
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
just I hadn't realized that one of them
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
would only be the machines and one of
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
them would only be the tables but
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
um I I did want to
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
just ask
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
again why we bother to put in transfer
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
or sale of license prohibited when the
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
businesses are already there there are
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
at least four in the group that Lebanon
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
is in that are owned by the same outside
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
of the state companies working through a
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
developer in
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester and there I think are the two
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
in in uh
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
nashwa are also owned by the same person
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes and probably with people from
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
outside the state controlling that one
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh so it's really hard to think that
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
this is any kind of a free market
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
and I gather that the Lottery Commission
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
does not think that um that a light a um
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
business can be kept from merging with
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
another in any way at any time so thank
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
you for the question again if I
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a restatement of
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
law that says that the license itself
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
cannot be sold outside the business so I
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
can't remember I I form a business I
 
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
apply for a gaming a charitable gaming
 
00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
license and then I apply for an HHR
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
license right those two licenses are
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
assets of the business they can't be
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
sold separately from the business that's
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
just a restatement of law that makes it
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
clear that that's what we intend is that
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
the license itself I can't sell the HHR
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
license outside of selling my whole
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
business and I can't sell my charitable
 
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
gaming license outside of selling my
 
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.349 align:start position:0%
gaming license outside of selling my
whole

00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
business could I just ask yeah
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
does this I don't remember the law being
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
any different before this so does this
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
change whatever it was um actually
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
create any further impediment to us
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
Vegas so again um represent M me to my
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
point you can always sell a business and
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want to restrict the
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
sale of businesses in the state of New
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they're just llc's and
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
you would have to good luck trying to
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
figure that out out um this says you
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
can't sell the license in and of itself
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
so I can sell my business and if my
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
business has assets the assets go with
 
01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:36.750 align:start position:0%
business has assets the assets go with
that

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
business does this change what is the
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
change in the existing language again I
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
think it takes what's in currently in
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
rules and puts it into law oh um we've
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
always had the idea that you could never
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
sell a license um and this just puts it
 
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
into statute that clarifies and restates
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
you cannot sell your license it makes it
 
01:00:59.549 --> 01:00:59.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear representative duet
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
that was oh
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent elberger thank you Mr
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
question uh licensed Charities yeah I
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
know I can do this you have trouble uh
 
01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.829 align:start position:0%
know I can do this you have trouble uh
licensed

01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
Charities um are I assume uh Charities
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
that are under
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
501c but the following numbers are not
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
restricted well actually they are and
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's in the charitable gaming statute
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
like um um so there are there are
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions what what qualifies and what
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't and that's in the um gaming
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
statute now is that a similar list to
 
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
the list that we were talking about in
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
the last bill I'm not sure I don't think
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
so because again that was talking more
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
about not for-profits for charitable
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
purposes and not necessarily charitable
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
charitable operations so um I will say
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
just to take a divers that section about
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
that RSA and that bill was added at
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosa Wall's request um she asked
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
she wanted a bill and I just agreed to
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
it so you strike it I have no problem
 
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:05.799 align:start position:0%
with that it wasn't in the original Bill
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
follow follow up thank you um I'm
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
curious as to why um we have Charities
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
given preference over
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities again that was a
 
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
negotiated agreement in the Senate uh
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
with our Democratic colleagues and our
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
Republican colleagues um the Charities
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
didn't want to see lost Revenue so again
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we for
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
if we forced or or if we said that
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities were treated exactly the
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
same but there was a shall in there
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
saying every year they get 7 to 10 days
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
um then there's a charity gets displaced
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
and that causes some consternation in
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
our group um in the Senate Ways and
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
Means so we wanted to make sure that no
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
charities got displaced by the
 
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
municipality one more very um I'm not
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
sure this is a question but more of a
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
statement if we look at a charity as an
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
organiz ganization that provides for the
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
public good without a financial benefit
 
01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.190 align:start position:0%
public good without a financial benefit
for

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
shareholders I don't see a definition a
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
distinction between a charity and a
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
municipality I agree thank you represent
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um last year we had
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
some questions about the fairness of how
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
the Charities were selected and the fact
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
that when they get in the door you know
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
they get to stay there usually and it's
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
the operators that of the um
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
establishment that select who they are
 
01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
do we what is the status of that do we
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
have a study commission looking at that
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
or is
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
are oh I'm sorry there are there any
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
bills related to that so again the
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
charal gaming commission is looking at
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
that um to make recommendations on any
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
necessary representative
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
Ames um
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
just uh further on the ownership and the
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
transfer question that representative
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
Aly was asking um I think it would you
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
agree that uh it would be possible for
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
the state to set a a rule
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
in uh legislation that even the
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming commission might
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that would um uh preclude sort
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
of monopolization of all the um
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
operating historic horse racing
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming sites by one entity
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
you could you could uh limit and uh
 
01:04:38.079 --> 01:04:39.349 align:start position:0%
you could you could uh limit and uh
limit

01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
owners you could spread out the
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
ownership I we could figure out a way to
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
do that um that would not
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
preclude a owner of a
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
particular uh one of these Enterprises
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
from selling it but they just couldn't
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
sell it to another casino operator in
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
the state so that you would avoid this
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
monopolization issue that I think
 
01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
representative Aly is concerned
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
about so I guess my answer is yes having
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
served four terms in the house three
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
terms in the house and one in the Senate
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
wants including allowing short tail
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
monkeys for
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
pets all right representative spillsbury
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Senator Lang I
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can uh clarify for us what
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
was the effect of the amendment adopted
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
by the Senate relative to its original
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so it was the addition of
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
the municipal hosts um was a was the big
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
part I I think we also my original bill
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
was a four-year and we negotiated to a 7
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
year to get everybody on board okay I
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
wondered about that looking at the
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note where it refers to four
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
years so it was originally introduced as
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
2028 and it was amended to 2031 correct
 
01:06:00.359 --> 01:06:02.990 align:start position:0%
2028 and it was amended to 2031 correct
thank

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
you represent om thank you on do you why
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
do you not want to take the uh position
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
that was sent to you from the house
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
which we thought would have a better
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
chance of getting through the
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
governor I'm I'm assuming you're talking
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
about Senate Bill 112 and I'm not to
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
discuss that right
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
now why do you think that the governor
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
is more likely to take this one so again
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Senate Bill 112 and
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not ready to discuss that right now
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
no I'm talking about this
 
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
one I'm sorry so your questions why do I
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
think why would the governor sign this
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
one when he's refused to sign I wouldn't
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
presume to speak with the governor but I
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
had had conversations with the governor
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be he's in a favorable
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chairman uh my name
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
is Rick Newman I'm representing the New
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable gaming operators
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
Association we are in support of Senate
 
01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:33.510 align:start position:0%
Association we are in support of Senate
Bill

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
472 I wanted to uh start by uh trying to
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
answer a couple of questions that have
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
been asked um section three which is the
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
section that prohibits the sale of the
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
license is in fact simply a restatement
 
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
of the current law in the current law
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
that sentence exists
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
in Roman
 
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
2 this bill has redrafted Roman 2 so it
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
removed that sentence from Roman 2 and
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
it gives it its own paragraph So it's a
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
new paragraph 8 but that sentence is in
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
and has been in current law for many
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
years it is pretty well settled across
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
the country and I think probably across
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
the world that uh in the gaming business
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
you can't sell a license so uh I can by
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
an entity that may be eligible for a
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
license but then I have to go and prove
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
my own worth be vetted by the uh author
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
licensing Authority which in this case
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
is the Lottery Commission so I just
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
wanted I wanted to address
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
that in our view the most important part
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill is section s which is the
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
section that extends the moratorium date
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
out to
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
2031 and as you folks I'm sure well
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
aware this is at least the fourth time
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
you've seen a bill to extend uh that U
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
limitation or moratorium whatever you
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
want to call it uh you've passed Senate
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 51 which was vetoed by the governor
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh you've passed Senate Bill 112 which
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
would have made the moratorium
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
indefinite that's uh in the Senate has
 
01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
yet to be acted on you passed the
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative duet's bill which again I
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
I think I forget the number but it it
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
also made the uh moratorium uh
 
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
indefinite and um and here we are
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
addressing that issue again in My View
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
From what I understand this is the bill
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
that has a chance of becoming law so if
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to otherwise what happens in
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 24 and the question was asked
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
what would be the downside to that well
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
2024 unlimited entities could
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh apply for historic horse racing
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
licenses and at the moment you might U
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
while we have uh 14 Gaming facilities
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
and I believe 10 of them have historic
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
horse racing uh We Believe As game
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
operators that that's enough and the
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
market can't really take much more than
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill is going to allow up to
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
five other potential new
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
facilities but we don't think anybody
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
really wants to see a state with 50 or
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
100 locations and I believe that's a
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
very real possibility so uh we think
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
extending the moratorium is very
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
important uh and I just want to address
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
the host Community sections five and six
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
where that addresses where the
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
potentially where the money goes where
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
the money goes is not our concern that's
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
yours um we uh we are um you know happy
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
to have some of it go to a host
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
Community if that is the if it works out
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
in in as Senator Lang said it wouldn't
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
probably happen in every location
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
because many places have a waiting list
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
uh but those that don't could use this
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
provision to uh get money for the host
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
Community um I would point out
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
that given the fact that this bill will
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
increase by some number up to five uh
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
the number of facilities that will
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
likely be operating uh if this bill
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
passes uh just keep in mind that for
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
each facility that's that opens that's
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
730 new charity gaming dates that become
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
available so if a host Community got 10
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
days from each and every room that's
 
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
only 140 gaming dates and if one new
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
entity opens you're going to add 7:30 to
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
the inventory so I don't see any you
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
know really diminishing
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
Charity's uh Revenue here um
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions if you
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
PL I'm
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
confused if I find the right line
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
now uh not with uh under uh page two
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
line 7 um not withstanding any
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
provisional law to the contrary game
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
operat employees licensed under RSA 287
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
D4 required to in operate minimum of
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
seven but not more than 10 game dates
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of town or city Etc
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
that's required and yet I hear from
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang that this is after
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
Charities if there dates available I'm
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
confused it uh how how does this what
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
does this required mean do they have to
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
bump Charities off to do it well I
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
believe I I I understand what you're
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
saying representative and keep in mind
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
we didn't participate in the drafting of
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
this language this is not our this isn't
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
our thing but I do believe that uh
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
section six uh
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
addresses that and says if there are
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
Charities available the municipality
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
days representative jet thank you Mr
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
question Mr
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
Newman um just for reference if if these
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh applicants that were in the queue
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
right now were to secure the licensees
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
you said
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh it would add somewhere in the
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of about 700 plus Charities
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
to the pool that would be eligible 730
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
game dates yes right the dates um do you
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
have any idea as to with the present
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
operators how many PE how many Charities
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
are in the weit lists or how many
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
Charities are in the queue to and this
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
is in relation to the charal gaming
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
commission too it's kind of information
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
that would be interesting specific to
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
this municipality compon my my latest
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
information excuse me my latest
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
information is that uh I believe all of
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
the rooms have a waiting list for
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
Charities um I'm not aware of any that
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
have Open dates follow up okay thank you
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
um and you don't a charity doesn't have
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
to be specific to that Community to that
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
specific Community say Salem Little
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
League Baseball can have a and I just
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
happen to know this have dates in
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester correct right so any any uh
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
qualified charity can be in any
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming room that's correct
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
and I would just point out that that was
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
really made possible by changes you
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
folks made a few years ago when you
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated the requirement that a
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
charity representative had to be at the
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
facility that opened the it up to so
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
that a place in a charity located in
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
Berlin could have game dates in
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester more of a statement because I
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
know it's not the operator's position um
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
but we as a legislature went through a
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
series of years where we were trying to
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
legalize Casino gaming in New Hampshire
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
and my town Salem was a focus of that to
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
me reading this and specifically the
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
requet language and and on and on to me
 
01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming Services charities
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
Charities that need Service delivery to
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
our communities and and we're all aware
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
of that this is a slippery slope writing
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
in town and I understand the benefit to
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
the towns and
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities but this legislature
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
chose the charity model to go forward
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to in any way shape or
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
form negate Service delivery to the many
 
01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
eligible uh Charities that do great work
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
constituents under the guise of a little
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
sugar cube for a town and municipality
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
for for hosting a charitable gaming room
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
so I just think we have a charitable
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
gaming model it needs to stay with the
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
Charities it if I could just address
 
01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.270 align:start position:0%
Charities it if I could just address
that

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
briefly excuse
 
01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
me I'm not going to say I disagree with
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
anything that you said representative
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
duet but I will say this I have I am
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
greatly concerned about this issue of
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
the moratorium and uh you know as we
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
know as the legislative process proceeds
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
and goes forward um we get into if we
 
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
have to get into a situation whether
 
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
there's a conference committee or
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
something like that I'm concerned about
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
the moror I think the uh the urgency of
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
extending the moratorium uh supersedes
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
any other concerns particularly
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
since and I can follow up with my
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
members to confirm this but I believe I
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
can represent without fear of
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
contradiction to you that uh at least as
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
of today every room has a waiting list
 
01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.750 align:start position:0%
of today every room has a waiting list
for

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
ER representing the Charities you're
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
aware of whatever or what happens in
 
01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.950 align:start position:0%
aware of whatever or what happens in
other

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
states yes are are you aware of any
 
01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.110 align:start position:0%
states yes are are you aware of any
other

01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions where this type of legisl
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
exists I'm not we're we really are
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
unique in New Hampshire in every other
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the what is it 38 loc uh
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions I believe in the country
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
that offer casino gambling it's all
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
commercial gambling that doesn't mean
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
there isn't Bingo or other types of
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
Charity gaming that take place in those
 
01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
other states there certainly are but our
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
casino gambling in in New Hampshire is
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
focused on charity gaming and there is
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
no other other state that does anything
 
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.709 align:start position:0%
no other other state that does anything
like

01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay thank you seeing no
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
chairman next I have uh
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
margin thank you chairman janigian um
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
my name is Alyssa marglin I'm here
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Center
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
for nonprofits
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
we're the Statewide Association of New
 
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's nonprofit sector um we do
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
not have a position on the moratorium
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak uh and raise concerns
 
01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.030 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak uh and raise concerns
about

01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
um uh shifting revenue from uh the
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
charitable sector to the host community
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
and also um uh issues around how um
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
Charities are selected so again we don't
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
have a position on the moratorium and as
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
you've just had a good exchange you know
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
we have um gaming in New Hampshire to
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
the extent that we license a sponsoring
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
charity and those Charities include C3
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
C4 C7 C8 C10 c19 according to our gaming
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
statutes so we license those entities
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
that sponsor operators who provide these
 
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
activities for the public um and that
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
has um brought in really essential
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the nonprofit sector and in
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the um we rely on the
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector more than other states
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh providing essential services to our
 
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
communities um this of course lowers tax
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
burdens overall because uh we have fewer
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
government contracts and we're able to
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
identify philanthropic and other sources
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
of revenue for the charitable sector I
 
01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
do want to thank chairman Lang and the
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
members of his committee when we express
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about the proposal to shift
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
dates that were currently available to
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
the Charities uh to the host community
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
that we were opening the door to a
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
slippery slope as we know in New
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are many needs uh don't
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
doubt that there are um impacts and
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
costs that happen at the municipal level
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
and we do recognize that um uh all the
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
effort and infrastructure that goes into
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
make these activities that happen that
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
generate this revenue and his committee
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
did provide a thoughtful amendment that
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
essentially gives the right a first
 
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
refusal or however you want to look at
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
it that says if you have a wait list and
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
you have charities in line that you
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't provide those dates to host
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
communities um we we ask this committee
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
to consider if there may be other
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
another source uh that makes more sense
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
to address some of the needs because
 
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
really the although the revenue
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
generated for a charity is Meaningful
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
for their bottom line so for example one
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
of our members provides shelter beds uh
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence boys and girls
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
clubs provide extra after school um
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
activities and can provide uh capacity
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
for that but whether or not this is
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
really going to C provide for the law
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement needs or whatever the the
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
local needs are we're not sure that that
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue here really makes sense but we
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
do appreciate um the effort and the
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
understanding and that we were heard in
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate but I do want to say that for
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
us um on page two section six lines
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
essentially 255 through 27 this was
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
extra language that was added to the
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
says shall not apply if the facility
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
lensey institutes a policy for bidding
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
the facility from hosting a specific
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
charity or specific type of Charity due
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
to Prior conflicts with Charity
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
management or employees we're not aware
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
of any history of kind of problematic
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
relationships between the sponsoring
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
charity and the management we're not
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
really sure what the enforcement
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism would be for this we are
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about um issues Around Mission
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
bias and other things that could come
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
into play so ask that you consider
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
striking that if you decide to keep uh
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment um with that that really
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh concludes um our our testimony and
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
our our view of this proposal I'm happy
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank
 
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
you represent no any question yeses pres
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question one of the things
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
you pointed out is that New Hampshire is
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
heavily dependent on charitable
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
organizations to provide
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
services and uh that cities and towns
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
are not able
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
to if there were funding for cities and
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
towns to provide the services that
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
Charities are picking
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
up how would you then feel
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
about um giving municipalities the same
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
access to those charitable
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
dates my understanding is that this
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
proposal would not translate into a
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit grant program at the municipal
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
level or
 
01:23:13.629 --> 01:23:13.639 align:start position:0%
enhanced services for vulnerable
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
populations or other things but I mean
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
again we um our our nonprofits are kind
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
of local Partners everywhere um New
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Center for nonprofits spends a
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
lot of time teaching good management and
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
stewardship and best practices and
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
obviously nonprofit sector is open more
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
to public scrutiny of Revenue and
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
spending um and so we don't uh we don't
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
want to keep municipalities from uh
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
raising the revenue needed to uh host
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
gaming in their Community we just don't
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
think that gaming days from the
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
Charities is the way to do it um but you
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
know we do understand that overall an
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of Gaming could be an
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
expansion of Revenue days for for
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
Charities uh and it is a complex issue
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and so we understand that you know
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
there compromises needed and and give
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
and take uh but in this case we don't
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
feel like we are really solving
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal needs and um we're potentially
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
opening up a slippery slope pulling
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
money away from Charities followup
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
followup thank you my
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
question is if municipalities were given
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
the funding that they
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
needed which might include some funding
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
through charitable organizations that
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
that is currently limited to uh
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations through these
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
casinos would the need for charitable
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
organizations to pick up those Services
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
which municipalities may not be able to
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
afford because some of their revenue is
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
being lost and quite frankly not being
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
provided by the
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
state would you be looking at this
 
01:25:07.159 --> 01:25:08.990 align:start position:0%
state would you be looking at this
differently

01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
um and your comment about uh
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
transparency in in terms municipalities
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
are probably the
 
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.870 align:start position:0%
are probably the
most

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.149 align:start position:0%
most
uh

01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
monitored but but I'm wondering if
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities were getting some of the
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
funding that's now being moved into
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations and we're
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
actually able to provide the services
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
that belong to the municipalities to
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
provide how so I think I understand
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative elberg are you saying if
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
more Revenue was provided to host
 
01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities would that translate into
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
more services for the public good
 
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
lessening the need for the charitable
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
sector is that your question so that is
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
not our experience for example pandemic
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
related resources that came to many
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities um uh did not translate
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
into the municipalities taking on
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
delivering those services and in limited
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
cases where that happened they have
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
pulled back so for example in the city
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
of Manchester right now you know the the
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
incoming mayor who's very dedicated to
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
addressing the issues around
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
homelessness has pulled back on
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal support for the shelter saying
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
that this needs to be run by the by the
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit community so I mean we um
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
we're again it's always in Partnership
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
and there are there's County resources
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
there are municipal resources and
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
federal resources that flow through
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
Title One communities that go to the
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
charitable sector but in general I don't
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
think that this would take care of this
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
would not supplant the public good that
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
the charitable sector is doing but I
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the thought in the
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
question um I had a question over here
 
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative elme and then
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative PL yes have you thought
 
01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the fact that there is such a huge
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
profit that we are getting large numbers
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
of outside of New Hampshire um takeovers
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
going on on that on the model that was
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
used could be manipulated instead to use
 
01:27:19.149 --> 01:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
part of that profit for municipalities
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.119 --> 01:27:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
charities

01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
charities
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
um was that a question or more
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
which okay all right and that may be
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
something we can talk about in a work
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
session as well uh yes representative
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
lefley oh I'm sorry I already told
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
representative PL and then
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative leing thank you this may
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
be an obvious question but Charities
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
must like the moratoriums too because
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
the ones who get the dates get get
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
better Revenue than if there were 50
 
01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
100 um again the center for nonprofits
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on the
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
moratorium um there is I don't think any
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
competitive benefit uh to it either way
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
in fact you know having more gaming
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
dates would would make more Revenue
 
01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:13.719 align:start position:0%
available I do just for the um education
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
of of all of us overall um you know
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue has gone up the legislature has
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
allowed you know uh wage levels and um
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
to to increase um and so Wagers to
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
increase rather so uh however the
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
percentage that's going to the chable
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
sector has decreased significantly so
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
while the revenue in the space has grown
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
and the overall dollar amount to the
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
sector has grown Charities now take uh
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
10% less of the revenue um and that's
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
likely to uh continue uh because of the
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
HHR um
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
and just the profitability of the
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
activity representative
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair um are you
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
aware of any negative impacts of
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
gambling on host
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
communities I I can't speak for the um
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of um you know the
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
municipal Association or or any any
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
adverse impacts to what local
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities are dealing with thank
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you um
 
01:29:26.669 --> 01:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
um I too am concerned about the fact
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
that the percentage that's going to
 
01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
Charities is going down um so I think
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's something we need to keep in mind
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
um I think we also need to take a step
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
back and make sure we're looking at the
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
big picture of what gambling is supposed
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
to be doing in our state like why we
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
allow this in the first place and why we
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
are supposed to oversee it so I think
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
your point about the chair ities is is
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
well taken that it's supposed to be um
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
going there and we know that a much
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
bigger percentage is going to the game
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
operators many of whom are outside of
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so this could be a
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
siphon increasingly of money leaving New
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire instead of enriching um
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofits which it's was designed to do
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
so I think we need to think about the
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
big picture of this I also am um
 
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
saddened about your I come from
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
represenative is there a question there
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
do you have a question for
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
her um yes I do have a question okay if
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
I ask please ask the question
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned about your comments
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
about Manchester it
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if you feel that the
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with the cities um are
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
declining because it seems to me
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
that the the philosophy of this is we
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to raise taxes we can provide
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
funds to Charities they'll provide the
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
public services that used to be provided
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
by the state or the city and so
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
therefore we won't have to raise taxes
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
do you feel that your relationship with
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
the cities is declining because of this
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
concept of the Cities don't have any
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
money to provide public services that is
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
for the charities to do and so we the
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
city as you cited in Manchester aren't
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
going to do that work because we don't
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
have the money it's not our job it's the
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
Charity's job do you feel like that has
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
changed recently I mean overall I can't
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
really cite examples of a declining
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
relationship I if if the pandemic has
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
taught us anything about the charitable
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
sector is that nonprofits are essential
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that they are incredibly Nimble um
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that our um most productive
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh Community oriented nonprofits have
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
managed to work with every
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
Administration from every party in many
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
different fiscal challenges highs and
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
lows um and uh for the most part I do
 
01:32:09.629 --> 01:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
think it's a a very solid foundation my
 
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
point was simply um responding to
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative elberger if I thought
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
that more Revenue headed towards
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities would supplant the need
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
for the charitable sector was no but
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
generally I I don't feel that there's
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
any kind of relational decline between
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
our you know we're where uh we have our
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal sector we have our nonprofit
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
sector we have our private sector and
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
when they're all working together um you
 
01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
know I think it's uh good outcomes for
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
granite Staters thank you thank you
 
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you thank you
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
very much thank you all right that's all
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
I have for pink cards is there anyone
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
else who would like to testify testify
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
on S SP
 
01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:52.830 align:start position:0%
on S SP
472

01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.840 --> 01:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
still morning good morning Mr chairman
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
record my name is Katherine Heck from
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
The New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
and I did not prepare testimony but I
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
did want to make sure that we expressed
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we are neutral on this bill and
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
while that might seem a bit surprising
 
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
as we do come to you regularly looking
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
for state aid and partnership with the
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
state on a number of issues in this
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
particular case we do not take positions
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
on bills that could potentially pit
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
municipality against municipality where
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
some currently might have gaming and
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
others might not have that option this
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be a legislative decision um that
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
we will not be weighing in on as to
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not you allow cities and
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
towns to have um some portion of the
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming I will say that we do
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
enjoy our 234 cities and towns very very
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
healthy and important relationships with
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
our nonprofits who provide services a a
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
a huge range of services Statewide to
 
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
our residents and our municipalities do
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
enjoy working with our nonprofits to
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
fill those holes that the government
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
cannot fill so we do find our nonprofit
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
sector to be critical to be critical to
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
our residents and I just didn't want to
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
think that there was um it if there's
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
some individual tensions going on or in
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
some area um that is not something that
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
we're getting a lot of feedback on as we
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
know that our members really do work
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
with their nonprofit partners and they
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
are really critical in our communities
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
as they do respond quickly and nimbly
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
and flexibly to things that government
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
might not be able to do so if you have
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm happy to take them I
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted our neutral position on the
 
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
record thank you representative PL uh
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%

leapley thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I understand
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to weigh in on
 
01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
something where it might be competitive
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
between different municipalities because
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
of their relationship with gaming um I'm
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh the association is aware
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
or is municipalities have expressed any
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
concerns about gaming um that it's been
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
a negative impact uh or cost them money
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
that they've needed to invest in you
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
know maybe gaming addiction has
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
increased or anything like that thank
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
you so I have not heard of anything
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
around gaming addiction specifically I
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
do know that with any business that
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
brings in visitors any business at all
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
we we do see an increase in perhaps our
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
Public Services like police fire for for
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
that for example and I do know the
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
Senate was trying to address that influx
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
into a community around gaming in their
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I will say that a charity
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm involved in locally in my
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
little Community was able to get a space
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
after two years um it's our meeting
 
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
house restoration committee for our town
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
and we got on the charitable gaming list
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
um in lonia I believe and we live in by
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and Greenfield so far away and
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
we got $155,000 from our our two- we
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
stint so again I think that depending on
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
the facility the the the amount of time
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I can't speak to the financial what
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
each town would receive because that is
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
a question that has been asked of us and
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to that because I think it
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
depends on the receipts of that casino
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
in that time period um so I think it
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
really is very dependent as I know other
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
communities have received $60,000 for
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
their charity um in that same period at
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
a different location representative PL
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
um yes is you say there may be some
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
increase police and fire and so on what
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
what is the property tax revenue for uh
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
CH for gaming establishments compared to
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
any other commercial property well it's
 
01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
assessed certainly the same way as any
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
other other property we have to be fair
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable and proportionate so it's
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
assessed the same way as any other
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
commercial space and again I'm not
 
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
picking on on our Gaming facilities and
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
saying that they do create or don't
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
create there's a many industries that
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
bring an influx of people in because
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
they're places that visitors would like
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
to um come and see which is positive for
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
our communities as well thank you
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative fellows uh thank you um
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
does your organization have a position
 
01:37:46.109 --> 01:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities um ability to say yes or
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
no to having um a Casino in their
 
01:37:57.629 --> 01:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
community and CU I think we have a bill
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
related to that but I don't think it's
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure the status of
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
that so just generally I won't speak
 
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
about other legislation in this hearing
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
but we always defer to the position of
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
local control and having the ability to
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
opt in and being able to plan and Zone
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
um accordingly so that it's um can be
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
successful for everybody involved so the
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
local option is always our deferred
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
preference follow up so so they so they
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
don't have that ability right
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
now I will have to get back to you I I
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
believe that local zoning and there are
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
certain considerations but I will have
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
to get back to with a more detailed
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
answer thank you I'm seeing no more
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much than you
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.430 align:start position:0%
 
time

01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay I will now close the public hearing
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
on Mr chairman before you close yeah I
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
have a question for lottery okay um can
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%

RTI and I will get a pin card in happy
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you Mr
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this
 
01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.149 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this
question

01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
um it says a total of five entities I'm
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
reading the methodology on the back of
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
note speaks about the the total of five
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
entities applied for a game operator and
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
then your last page the Lottery
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
Commission States it cannot assess the
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
final impact of this because it is
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
unclear how many of the five additional
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
applicants will be found suitable for
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and squally seek a
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
license to offer
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
HHR is there a theoretical
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
mathematical way for you to just give
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
estimates so I there there there isn't
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
really um so the the all we can tell you
 
01:40:17.589 --> 01:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
is that with regard to the language as
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
it sits right now that open that second
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
window from January 1 to October 18
 
01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:24.990 align:start position:0%
window from January 1 to October 18
of

01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
2023 that there are five entities that
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
fit within that window um they're in
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
various States within their application
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
status licensing status and we can't
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
speak about that um so each one will be
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
vetted um and so we can't really address
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
today whether zero through five of those
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
will actually be licensed at the end of
 
01:40:50.159 --> 01:40:51.709 align:start position:0%
will actually be licensed at the end of
that

01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
process thank yeah representative
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
Aly uh thank you this is for the chair
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes um I assume we'll be planning for a
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
work session yes and it would be helpful
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
at least for me to be really clear about
 
01:41:11.229 --> 01:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
if there a waiting list for every place
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me if there are
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
waiting lists for every place it does
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
really affect parts of the bill that
 
01:41:18.109 --> 01:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
means they'll be nothing for
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities and maybe nothing for any
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
new Charities and I think that really
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
puts this bill in a different context if
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
we already have these waiting lists so
 
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate that thank
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
El is there well we are apparently not
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to know anything about how much
 
01:41:46.109 --> 01:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
profit there is in this
 
01:41:46.119 --> 01:41:47.790 align:start position:0%
profit there is in this
business

01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh and but on I just wanted your take on
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
that um so representative Aly we do very
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
extensive Revenue reporting um on how
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
much revenue is taken in from each
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
Casino for each uh uh activity um and
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
obviously how much goes to each charity
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
and how much goes to the state and that
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
is all posted on our website so um
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's a um tremendous amount of
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
visibility into the economics um
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
certainly um um we don't have all of the
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
overhead costs that are associated with
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
operating um uh we we do a review uh
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
during licensing to make sure that the
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
um finances of the uh applicant or the
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
lcy are uh sustainable um but certainly
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
I think that there is visibility into
 
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.149 align:start position:0%
I think that there is visibility into
what

01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
into uh the revenue generation out of
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
these facilities um and I think um given
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
some other information that uh certainly
 
01:42:58.589 --> 01:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
the study committee has done um they've
 
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
they've gotten some testimony on some of
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
the costs that go into um operation of
 
01:43:04.239 --> 01:43:06.790 align:start position:0%
the costs that go into um operation of
the

01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
facility so get that clear on we can't
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
know the gross but we can know the net
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
after they've taken all of their
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
expenses including outside the
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
state the only thing that we don't have
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
complete visibility into is there
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
everyday operating costs or overhead um
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
so we certainly do understand some of
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
the the the the elements of that for
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
example um we're aware uh as an industry
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
that an HHR machine um if it's being
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
leased um that can cost 20% of the gross
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue around around that number
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
it can be a little more a little less
 
01:43:49.629 --> 01:43:49.639 align:start position:0%
depending on the specific game um
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
obviously there's labor cost there's
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
electric cost those types of things
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
that's not something that the state
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
collects on a regular basis because it
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an impact on either the
 
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
Charity's revenue or the state's Revenue
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
so in terms of uh I think what your
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
question is asking in terms of their net
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
profitability we don't have complete
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
insight into all overhead costs in these
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
build in these uh facilities um but
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
certainly I would say that there's a
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information available
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
about um about
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue that flows through these
 
01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
facilities representative fellows thank
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
you um I'm interested in the money
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's available from a from take one
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
Casino so the money that's available to
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
them probably it is divided into two
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
parts because one charity during a
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
certain night one charity is getting
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
money from the the slot machines and the
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
other one is getting money from the
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
table games
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
and I know that not all the casinos have
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
the slot machines so I I'm just
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
interested in the disparity so so if you
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
have if if we have a municipality and a
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
charity saving um on one night it
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
matters which part you're going to get
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
the money from anything you can share
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
about that yeah s f fellows thank you
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for the question because that was
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify something
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
there was that was divided in terms of
 
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
one one entity got HHR one entity got
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
table games that actually was sunset and
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
now it is an even split between all
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
revenues so when two Charities come in
 
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
um to a uh a facility um charity a and
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
Charity B end up both splitting the HHR
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
and go Revenue equally um with respect
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
to and just one other just fine point
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
just for your understanding in
 
01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
facilities and there's only a few at
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
this point that operate without HHR
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
machines they do not have to operate
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
with two Charities they only have to
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
operate with one and they choose to
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
usually only operate with one so there
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
is not that issue of U dividing up in
 
01:46:08.679 --> 01:46:10.830 align:start position:0%
is not that issue of U dividing up in
those

01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.629 align:start position:0%
those
facilities

01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you actually I've got one
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
question so uh representative Southworth
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
asked if we can find out if there's
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
waiting lists for all Charities is is
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
that something that you can get an
 
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
answer for uh so Mr chairman I know um
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Newman indicated that we are um on
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of the study committee um getting
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh information from uh Charities and we
 
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:40.360 align:start position:0%
took a survey of Charities within the
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
state I think we have three or 400 um
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
respondents so we should have some data
 
01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:48.679 align:start position:0%
on uh what charity experience is in
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
terms of getting um getting onto weight
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
lists or getting game dates um so
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
certainly we should have that I think in
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
advance of a work session okay thank
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
much okay with that I'm going to close
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
472 recognize me
 
01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.830 align:start position:0%

okay

01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay what are we on
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:58.270 align:start position:0%
 
59

01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay we will open the uh public hearing
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
on SB 597 and uh recognize Senator Lang
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman on behalf of
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
Senator aard I want to introduce Senate
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 597 Rel of the lucky s uh ticket
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
dispensary devices this bill is pretty
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
straightforward um current under current
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
law any machine we have that's done in a
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
social club or or a Lucky 7 machine has
 
01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to print paper tickets
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
however across the country that is no
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
longer the standard and it's becoming
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
harder and harder for these
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
organizations to be able to get Lucky
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
Seven tickets so we just do away with
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
the requirement um or even the option
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
that the machine must be able to print a
 
01:48:37.159 --> 01:48:38.510 align:start position:0%
that the machine must be able to print a
paper

01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
ticket that's the whole Bill thank you
 
01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
PL no no question but I got handed
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
signature list request for removal or
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
requirement for pull tab printers for
 
01:48:53.229 --> 01:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
electric Lucky 7
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
devices uh I won't read the entire
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
language but essentially is a support of
 
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and I by quick count it was 54
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh a game operators supporting the Bill
 
01:49:03.679 --> 01:49:04.709 align:start position:0%
uh a game operators supporting the Bill
thank

01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions for Senator
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
um represent elme yeah just one on the
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
reason I always opposed this was that it
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
slowed down the game so that it wasn't a
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
slot machine how much faster or is it
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
without this put that with you uh again
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't have an answer to that direct
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
question again the answer in the Senate
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
ways the Means Committee when his bill
 
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
was heard one of the key components was
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that the machine's becoming
 
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
harder to find um without a paper
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
because um if you can display it on the
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
screen having that option the print uh
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
is is a rarely taken and B the machines
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
are getting harder to
 
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.189 align:start position:0%
are getting harder to
find

01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me Mr chair I don't was this
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
introduced another day I wasn't given a
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
copy of this today uh 597 yes we got it
 
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
on a different day okay are there there
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
may be copies on the
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
table it's copies there's probably
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
there does anyone else have question uh
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
repres Aly did you have a follow okay
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
just I would like to hear from Valerie
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
question all right um thank you Senator
 
01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
Lang um uh Valerie king um if you
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
desk did you have an answer to that
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah could I just restate it on
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
are you going to be looking at these new
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
machines and how close they are to slot
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
Ma machines or to the HRM machines thank
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
you so good morning my name is Valerie
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
King with New Hampshire lottery um just
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh one of your questions was regard to
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
how fast it would if if not having paper
 
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
would speed it up I believe our rules it
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
would be based on our rules and I
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
believe they require that no that
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
there's at least a 3 to 5c delay between
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
each um before you can hit the button
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
again so having no paper won't change
 
01:51:22.119 --> 01:51:23.910 align:start position:0%
again so having no paper won't change
that

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
um as far as the difference between a
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 ticket dispenser and HHR and
 
01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
slot machines it's a Lucky 7 is based on
 
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
a defined deal there's only so many
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
winners and losers in a deal which is
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
different than HHR which is based on a
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
paramutual wager or slot machines which
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
is based on a random number generator so
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
while they all have uh video displays
 
01:51:52.109 --> 01:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
they the internal of how those wins or
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.229 --> 01:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
different thank
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
Rick Newman I'm representing Grover
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
gaming which is a manufacturer of Lucky
 
01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
7 machines that operated in New
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'll be very brief I just I I
 
01:52:28.069 --> 01:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out to the committee
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
that there was a time when the printing
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
of a ticket was required by state law in
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
these electronic lucky s
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
dispensers you folks made that optional
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
few years
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
back I can tell you that one facility
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
for instance that I'm aware of that had
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
about 50 of these devices would
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
literally throw away eight nine 10 big
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
green garbage bags of tickets every day
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
when they were required to be printed CU
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
customers you know the machine printed
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
it but the customer never looked at the
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
ticket because the display is on the
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
screen I can also tell you that since
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
you've made it optional there hasn't
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
been a roll of paper changed in any
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
machine that I'm aware of in the entire
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
State customers are not taking the
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
option so you might say well why do we
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
care then about it and the issue is
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
simply one of um ease of operation the
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
fact that a printer has to be connected
 
01:53:35.069 --> 01:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
can sometimes cause the machine to
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
malfunction or the printer has to be
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
addressed and then it shuts the machine
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
down and it's really for nothing because
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
people just don't print the ticket
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
anymore so I think um the evolution of
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
these machines is at a point where we've
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
proven that the printing of a ticket is
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
not necessary we'd ask you to support
 
01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.069 align:start position:0%
not necessary we'd ask you to support
the

01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you yes representative
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um I was under the
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
impression from testimony I heard I
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
think last year that these tickets were
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes sold by at
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
campgrounds and are they using video
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
machines at campgrounds uh Lucky Seven
 
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
tickets come in two forms one is
 
01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
electronic which is what this bill
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
addresses the other is a break open uh
 
01:54:26.109 --> 01:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
you typical ticket you used to see
 
01:54:29.069 --> 01:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
before machines existed um I would
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
assume if campgrounds are are selling
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
them they would be using the paper
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
breake open ticket I'm not aware of any
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
facility like that that has the
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:42.119 --> 01:54:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
devices

01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:54:48.069 --> 01:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
okay follow up so so this eliminates the
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
paper option eliminates the paper option
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
only in the electronic
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
dispensing oh okay device okay okay the
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
the paper ticket itself is
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
well okay great thank you very much
 
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
chair okay last pink ticket I have is uh
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
Ashley CH
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
menis that's correct
 
01:55:29.069 --> 01:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
perfect good morning everybody um good
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Ashley I CH
 
01:55:38.589 --> 01:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
Manis I represent Grover gaming in the
 
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um and in 2021
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
the regulation that required that the
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
electronic uh machines print a
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
representation of the outcome of every
 
01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
ticket played on an electronic device
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
was amended and the requirement that the
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
printed representation of the outcome of
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
that ticket played was adjusted from
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
being every time a ticket was played on
 
01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
the electronic device to optional for
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
the player to print a ticket if they so
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
choose and since that adjustment was
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
made virtually no player chooses to
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
print that piece of paper which is um
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
something that I had presented to the
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
committee they we have a uh an agreement
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
not an agreement we have um some
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
documentation that states that are
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
fraternal and Veteran charity Partners
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
do not have any players that print those
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
those uh options out
 
01:56:35.159 --> 01:56:36.990 align:start position:0%
those uh options out
um

01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
so when they were required to print
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
after every ticket played we were
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
changing the very large roles of paper
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
that Mr Newman spoke of um multiple
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
times a week and in some cases uh per
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
month um but
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
the the issue with this is that millions
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
of very small pole tabs that represented
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
wins or losses on these devices were
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
just being thrown out and they had been
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
doing that for years um since the change
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
we have not replaced a single roll of
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
paper in any active device in the field
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
and many of these devices have been in
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
some of these organizations for uh
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
years um since the electronic Lucky 7s
 
01:57:19.709 --> 01:57:19.719 align:start position:0%
still have the requirement that the
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
printed ticket be optional for the
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
player this can can lead to problems
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
with the machines themselves because if
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
a if a printer that creates this ticket
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
malfunctions in any way it puts that
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
machine out of operation until it's
 
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
fixed um so until a problem is is
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
resolved that machine cannot be played
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
which does not bring in revenue for
 
01:57:42.589 --> 01:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
those charitable
 
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
organizations um all plays on any
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
electronic device are electronically
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
recorded So the paper representations
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily needed for any kind
 
01:57:54.189 --> 01:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
of security reason um our machines
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
specifically also store 200 screenshots
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
of every of the last 200 tickets that
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
were played so um there is a visual
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
representation on the screen of the last
 
01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:06.589 align:start position:0%
representation on the screen of the last
200

01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:58:06.599 --> 01:58:08.430 align:start position:0%
200
plays

01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
plays
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
um the requirement to have the
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
electronic pole tab
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
machines uh print this ticket um has no
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
benefit to our charitable Partnerships
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
um those organizations and and it
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
provides a disservice whenever those uh
 
01:58:28.830 --> 01:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
printers are causing the machine to be
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
operation so I would like to add that of
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
the six states that our uh company
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
represents similar gaming in New
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state that
 
01:58:44.589 --> 01:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
requires this particular printing option
 
01:58:44.599 --> 01:58:47.229 align:start position:0%
requires this particular printing option
be

01:58:47.229 --> 01:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
available thank you
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh yes
 
01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:54.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
my question so on average how many
 
01:59:01.069 --> 01:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
tickets does the average player
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
pull uh that's not necessarily a
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
question that can be answered you'll
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
have a player that sits down for 20
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
minutes and might play through you know
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
40 electronic plays you might have a
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
player that sits down for 3 hours and
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
plays through a thousand
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
um the fact of the matter is having the
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
printing still have to be an option if
 
01:59:25.229 --> 01:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
that printer that is in the base of the
 
01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
cabinet malfunctions for any reason
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
especially if a player is in the middle
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
of play not that it happens that often
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
but it can it puts that machine in out
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
of out of operation so the player is not
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
able to cash or or um pull their ticket
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
collect their ticket from their
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
Redemption ticket from the machine until
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
that machine is functional
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
again follow up follow up so if a player
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
wanted a paper ticket
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
is a printer available to hook up
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
quickly or is that not an option the
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
printers are always available so if a
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
player wanted to print out the ticket
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
they they do have right now currently
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
the option to just play the ticket and
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
then request the the machine print out
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
that paper slip but because that is the
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that that printer has to be
 
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
available for the machine to operate if
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
it does not operate for whatever reason
 
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
it puts that machine out of operation
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
mhm so because because the printer has
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
to be functioning on that device it's
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
always available to the player but the
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
players never use uh last followup
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
followup so if uh Jupiter and Mars align
 
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a solar
 
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
eclipse thank
 
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
you all right I
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
think I'm in the dark about that one
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you all right is there
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
any anyone else would like to testify
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
testify on S SP
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
597 seeing none I'll close the public
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
s597 okay um we have one more public
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
hearing uh but before I do that I want
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
to jump back and uh reopen the exec
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
session which I believe should be fairly
 
02:01:24.629 --> 02:01:24.639 align:start position:0%
quick on S sp513 uh open that back up we
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:54.390 align:start position:0%
 
out

02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
so the amendment being passed out
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
removes that one reference to the RSA
 
02:02:07.229 --> 02:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
previously does anybody have uh
 
02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:12.510 align:start position:0%
previously does anybody have uh
any

02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:02:14.669 --> 02:02:14.679 align:start position:0%
question looks pretty straightforward
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative PL I move to adopt Senate
 
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%

585

02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:04.559 align:start position:0%

and once again I'll recognize
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%

am Senator Lang I uh serve as a senator
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
from Lakes Region District 2 um I'm here
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
to present uh Senate Bill
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
585 um 585 is a pretty straightforward
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
bill um currently when a restaurant is
 
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
behind on its uh rooms and meals tax or
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax I guess it's
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
called now um that that tax if it's
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
owned by an LLC if the entity that
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant is owned by an
 
02:09:44.430 --> 02:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
LLC um Dr can apply a lean a personal
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
lean on everyone's personal property
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
who's a member of that
 
02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
LLC however if that same restaurant is
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
owned by a corporation and you have
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
Equity investors the only people that
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
can be applied to the propert private
 
02:09:59.830 --> 02:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
property lean are the op are the um
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
operating the president of the
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
corporation as well unless there was
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
been an asset transfer and if there's an
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
asset transfer recorded by the
 
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
corporation anybody who got um any
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
stockholder who got assets is also
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
liable for the rooms and meals tax so
 
02:10:15.870 --> 02:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
the uh goal of this bill is to treat L
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
LLC similar to our corporations if you
 
02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
have a passive investor which is non
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
uncommon in New Hampshire for restaurant
 
02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
um they have no role in how the
 
02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants run they they were asked to
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
put up some money to help open up the
 
02:10:30.270 --> 02:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant so they put up the money
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
their goal is that in three five years
 
02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
they get their money back with some
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
interest and but they have no
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
operational um responsibilities within
 
02:10:40.549 --> 02:10:40.559 align:start position:0%
the restaurant in of itself um the goal
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
is not to have that private LLC passive
 
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
investor be responsible and have their
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
personal house um put up on a put a lean
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
up on for it so they're treated s
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
similar to a corporation as a passive
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
investor an equity investor in a
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
corporation in a restaurant
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
um that's the whole bill in a nutshell
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
again it's to reduce leans um of private
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
investors in LLC that are passive in
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
nature again provided there was no asset
 
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
transfer and they're not um responsible
 
02:11:14.189 --> 02:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
for the operation so they're not um the
 
02:11:15.790 --> 02:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
managing partner they're not the uh
 
02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
they're not the chef or the or the
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
manager the the of the restaurant itself
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
um they could not be held personally
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
liable for their personal
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
property I will say that it requires G
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
to do a little more work but I would
 
02:11:30.750 --> 02:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
hope if you're going to put a a lean on
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
a piece of private property you would do
 
02:11:33.870 --> 02:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
the work to make sure you're putting a
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
lean on the right person's property
 
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
rather than just
 
02:11:40.109 --> 02:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you questions
 
02:11:40.119 --> 02:11:43.350 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you questions
representative

02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
Erie yeah oh represent arm
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
me I'm not
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
on I I wanted to
 
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
understand how you Define
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
management you have restaurants that are
 
02:12:06.599 --> 02:12:07.830 align:start position:0%
management you have restaurants that are
um

02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:13.069 --> 02:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
owned uh at 51% interest uh of the of
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
the restaurant is owned on by owns five
 
02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:19.350 align:start position:0%
the restaurant is owned on by owns five
different

02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants are they cons the person
 
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
that owns most of it but isn't
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily the
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
manager of each
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant on is it the guy that he
 
02:12:39.629 --> 02:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
hired to be the manager in the
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant the manager or is the guy
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
that owns the majority of the shares in
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
the LLC so again if they're responsible
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
for the management of the LLC officer or
 
02:12:53.709 --> 02:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
there's been an asset transfer they
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:00.270 align:start position:0%
 
liable

02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
liable
 
02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
so he had somebody who owns five
 
02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:06.709 align:start position:0%
so he had somebody who owns five
different

02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants or I know one that owns more
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
than that um at least one and but he
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
leaves the management to them and just
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
checks the books every now and then or
 
02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
something or just takes the checks um he
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
has no
 
02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility again just being a member
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
of the live of the LLC would not
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
automatically subject you to the lean
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
even if you own most of it I'm sorry
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
even if you own most of the
 
02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
business again that may be again if
 
02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
you're a passive investor and you're
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
just a member of the LLC not actively
 
02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
engaged in the running of the business
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
you would not be subject to the lean the
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
goal is to spur investment in our our uh
 
02:13:54.119 --> 02:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
goal is to spur investment in our our uh
hospitality

02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
McDonald's on then it would be the local
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
person who is having to do everything
 
02:14:13.549 --> 02:14:13.559 align:start position:0%
that they told him to do from
 
02:14:16.589 --> 02:14:16.599 align:start position:0%
McDonald's um who would be responsible
 
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
for not having gotten the checkout in
 
02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:21.790 align:start position:0%
for not having gotten the checkout in
time

02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand your
 
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.109 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand your
question

02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
on well I thought I like if I can
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
interject representative we have uh
 
02:14:35.709 --> 02:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
someone from Dr maybe yes I know I know
 
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask them
 
02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:39.990 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask them
too

02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
but I thought I'd give the sponsor a
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
chance representative flet
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
then I I'm reading the bill which is I
 
02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
know not very smart thing to do and it
 
02:14:55.709 --> 02:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't match with what you said the
 
02:14:57.310 --> 02:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill was because I don't
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
see anywhere in there P you can point it
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
out refers to a passive investor it just
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
says that lean shall be applied and it
 
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
will be include any
 
02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:11.669 align:start position:0%
will be include any
person

02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh could be somewhere in there about
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
with a manager uh managerial capacity
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
president trees other person or
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity so it lean could be
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
applied to the people running the
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
business but I don't see anything about
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh a passive investor and there would
 
02:15:32.430 --> 02:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
explain please so again that's that's it
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
used to say in uh so again on line 11 of
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
the bill that the two words that are
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
struck out there includes members and
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
those members who are not active in the
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity of the LLC could be
 
02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
are the passive investors and we're
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
taking those members out and just
 
02:15:49.709 --> 02:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
talking about the persons in the man
 
02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity of LLC do that
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be clearer it said it
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
explicitly said if someone's a passive
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
investor they're not included so in an
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
LLC you have members right versus a S
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
Corp or a C Corp we all have Equity
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
owners and so in LLC everybody's a
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
member although you have managerial
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
members as well and so the point is if
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
you're just a passive member of an C
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
because you provided an equity you
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
provided an in uh some in revenue for
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
the purpose of opening the restaurant
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't make you subject to it just
 
02:16:32.429 --> 02:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
being a member by in and of in and of
 
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
itself represent erery followed by
 
02:16:40.509 --> 02:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
fellows um Senator so your contention is
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
that by striking the word member um
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating all of the by
 
02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
definition under the LLC law passive
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
individuals then by putting the word
 
02:16:55.309 --> 02:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
managerial in there which is an
 
02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
undefined term under
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
LLC who are the managers because the
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
director doesn't necessarily need to be
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
a member and yet the director is the one
 
02:17:08.349 --> 02:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
doing the day-to-day stuff so should
 
02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
should we add director and other
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
managerial members I'll just remind you
 
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't new law this is existing law
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
what I've done is I've struck the word
 
02:17:21.389 --> 02:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
member and and the word
 
02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
three words right so that it makes it
 
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
clear that leans are applied to again
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
under current law any person in a manage
 
02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
capacity of a limited liability company
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
so that's current law I'm not adding
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
that to statute what I'm doing is I'm
 
02:17:39.309 --> 02:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
striking the members and making it clear
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's the managerial U members of an LLC
 
02:17:43.629 --> 02:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
up who's a managerial member if it's not
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
find in either the LLC law or this law
 
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
Dr is coming up I'm sure you can they
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
again this is law that they already have
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't new definition a person in a
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity of a limited
 
02:18:05.230 --> 02:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
liability company has current law I'm
 
02:18:07.469 --> 02:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
not adding that so they've already made
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
that determination already do make that
 
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
determination some way shape or form
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
under current
 
02:18:15.070 --> 02:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
law thank
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
you okay let me get the there's a lot of
 
02:18:18.669 --> 02:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
questions let me get the order straight
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent so if I wanted to know
 
02:18:29.070 --> 02:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
who are these people you know so there's
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
an LLC out there you know a restaurant
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
LLC and how will would I know who are
 
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
the members and the person in a
 
02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity and also this is a
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
lean on
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
property the LLC not own any property
 
02:18:56.349 --> 02:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
somebody the wife of one of the members
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
might own the property so how do you
 
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
address that so again that's a true
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
statement um I I again this is not new
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
law um only thing we're doing in this
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
law is removing the word members which
 
02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
are the passive investors not actively
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
engaged in the management of the LLC
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing this is doing the
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
law current exists so Dr is already
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
making these determinations and already
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
applying leans um um to the two people
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
the only difference is we don't want
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
them to apply leans to passive investors
 
02:19:28.750 --> 02:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
who are not active in um how the
 
02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
businesses run or anything else they
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
provided a an upfront bunch of money so
 
02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:34.519 align:start position:0%
they can open up a restaurant and then
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
the restaurant goes sideways and it's up
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
the Dr to determine who's responsible
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
for that and and to make sure the leans
 
02:19:43.349 --> 02:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
go to those persons again there's
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
already under current law under current
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
process under Equity investors for the
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
purposes of a corporation they make the
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
same determination um if there's an
 
02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
asset transfer in a corporation of of
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
assets of the corporation to a private
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
to a equity owner that automatically
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
makes the Equitable Equitable owner
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
subject to a lean so Dr is making these
 
02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:08.950 align:start position:0%
subject to a lean so Dr is making these
determinations

02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
already okay um I don't know who was
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
first Southworth or leapley but leapley
 
02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:16.870 align:start position:0%
first Southworth or leapley but leapley
representative

02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair I two
 
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions um thanks for taking my
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
question Senator Lang um I have two
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions the first one is what problem
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
is this solving so again so in cases of
 
02:20:34.030 --> 02:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
we have passive investors who had no
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
actual idea of running the business they
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
just gave some money to an LLC and said
 
02:20:39.870 --> 02:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
run the business in 5 years I'll see you
 
02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
I'll get my profit back um and in the
 
02:20:45.550 --> 02:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
meantime that business didn't pay their
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
rooms of meals tax and now that private
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
investor has nothing to do with how the
 
02:20:50.349 --> 02:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
business is running they just gave them
 
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
money is getting their private property
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
attached for the liability that the
 
02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant owns thank you my second
 
02:21:00.190 --> 02:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
question is my understanding of a member
 
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
in an LLC is a someone who can receive
 
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
profit from an LLC and it seems to me
 
02:21:09.550 --> 02:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't matter very much if
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
you're involved in managing the company
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
or not if you're responsible for not
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
having paid those taxes but you should
 
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
have a lean placed on your property if
 
02:21:23.950 --> 02:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
you receive profit or are in line to
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
receive profit from a business so to me
 
02:21:29.710 --> 02:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
it seems like the bill is appropriate as
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's laid out so again I think that goes
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
back into the phrase of transfer of
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
assets so if the money is transferred to
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
you then they could apply a lean to you
 
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
but if you haven't gotten received any
 
02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
money and you're not part of that
 
02:21:42.190 --> 02:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
operation of the event again there's
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
times where a restaurant will receive
 
02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
and and there are people here from the
 
02:21:46.590 --> 02:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
hospitality injury probably speak a way
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
more better to this than I can but my
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is there are passive
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
investors put money into the they have
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
no operational um controls over the
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
business other than they put investment
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
money in and and the ideaas they should
 
02:22:01.950 --> 02:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
not be subject to a private lean but
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
going back to what member clut
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
said what the bill says is includes
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
members and and you're striking
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
members correct so it's only managerial
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
or people have had assets transferred to
 
02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
them so the bill that you're asking us
 
02:22:22.750 --> 02:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
to pass would make it so we can't put a
 
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
lean on
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
anyone who on the people who are in line
 
02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
to receive profits from a company who
 
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
didn't pay their taxes that we should
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
wait until the profit is transferred to
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
that um that member and then we could
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
put a lean on their on their property so
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
I just say that's exactly what happens
 
02:22:44.349 --> 02:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
in a
 
02:22:46.349 --> 02:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
corporation right again in a in a
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
corporational aspect of it my
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
understanding Dr I'm sure will correct
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong um but um we only go
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
after the officers or where there's been
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
an an asset transfer do you so you think
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's the correct way of doing things
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
and so the Improvement to the law would
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
be to correct how we handle llc's and
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
not correct how we handle corporations I
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
think we handle corporations
 
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately again to encourage
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
investment into the hospitality industry
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
in New
 
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
you senator I I have a question so as
 
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
um you know if a manager if a lean was
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
placed because of a manager's failure to
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
pay um that's only on the property of
 
02:23:35.950 --> 02:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
the business not on the personal
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
property it's personal property that's
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this is that it's
 
02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
it's your home is being attached okay
 
02:23:43.150 --> 02:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
and you're saying this has always been
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
this way and all you're doing is
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
removing the idea that a member who
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
might be a passive investor um would
 
02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
have their home could not have their
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
home attached correct thank
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
you uh now down here representative
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
Southworth I'll ask the Dr as well
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so the
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
goal initially is to collect the taxes
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
for the state and so forth the original
 
02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
Law um will won't this change make it
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
harder for the state to collects the the
 
02:24:15.389 --> 02:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
taxes that are
 
02:24:19.230 --> 02:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
due again if I guess the answer is yeah
 
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
sort of it could
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
um the uh idea again being is the person
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
responsible should be the person who has
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
the lean placed on them right so it it's
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
a passive investor you may have no
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility at all in the in the LLC
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
and yet now you're being subject to it
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
just because you loaned your friend some
 
02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
money to start a
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant and now your personal house
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be attached because your
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
friend screwed it up understand that but
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
again just to reiterate it's going to
 
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
make it harder for the really the state
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
to become whole and collect its taxes I
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
just think it takes more due diligence
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
that they'd have to make sure the right
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
that they're attaching the lean to the
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
right person yeah and they still get it
 
02:24:58.269 --> 02:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
back because it's not stopping them from
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
doing I'll ask them that question too I
 
02:25:02.429 --> 02:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
think they are probably diligent but
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'll ask them thank
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
you I mean the other possib I just throw
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
this out another possibility might be um
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
that passive investors passive members
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
could be excluded as opposed to members
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
because some members can be active
 
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
active members probably ask that I don't
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
know that there's a delineation in law
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
of passive versus active members I don't
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
think there's a delineation that's why
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
we struck members and just said
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
managerial is responsible the people who
 
02:25:34.269 --> 02:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
manage the LLC is responsible and their
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
private property could be attached okay
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
person who's not actively managing the
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
LLC is not should not be attached
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question I'm
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
sure Dr can answer this if you can't but
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like this bill goes hand
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
inand with current law SAR Baines Oxley
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
where those that are responsible cannot
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
claim ignorance and therefore they're
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
held accountable correct so that's the
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
whole goal if you're a management you're
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
responsible for it you should do it but
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
if you're someone over here who not not
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
actively engag don't even know not NE
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't even know that the rooms
 
02:26:11.070 --> 02:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
of meals tax weren't pay paid until all
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
of a sudden they got a lean attached to
 
02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
their house absolutely
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
brilliant I I will say this passed out
 
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
of the Senate four to one bipartisan and
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
out of my committee and then it was a
 
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
Voice vote on the senate
 
02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
flooor representative Amy or no
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative Aly thank you um
 
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
does would you object if we um amended
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
this to require the the Secretary of
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
State's office I guess it is to include
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
the information about who is passive and
 
02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
who is not uh in the annual report that
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
the businesses are supposed to make
 
02:26:56.190 --> 02:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
which I hope they are making because
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't used to having not thought
 
02:27:01.469 --> 02:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
about that before this moment um I'd be
 
02:27:03.269 --> 02:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
I'd be hesitant to make a definitive
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
statement but again I think that Dr is
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
easily able to make that uh assessment
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
again because they already have in law
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
the idea of who the managerial person is
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
law representative
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you if if somebody um was
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
asked to invest in the LLC become a
 
02:27:29.469 --> 02:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
member of the LLC and if they were
 
02:27:33.269 --> 02:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about their their property you
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
know being liable to seizure if the new
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
LLC didn't make any money um wouldn't
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
they have the option to just loan money
 
02:27:47.790 --> 02:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
to the to the LLC and um at a certain
 
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
interest rate so aren't they kind of
 
02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
like getting in this you know they they
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
should know what they're getting into
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
right there are multiple ways again
 
02:27:58.590 --> 02:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
multiple ways to uh invest that way that
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about whether it's a
 
02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
direct loan or whether it's uh part of
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
an LLC um so the answer your question I
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
guess is yes you could do it either
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
way and I would I would expect that if
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
you were that concerned you would become
 
02:28:14.190 --> 02:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
an active member in the LLC and be
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
involved in the management of it if you
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
were that concerned about getting your
 
02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:17.910 align:start position:0%
were that concerned about getting your
money

02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
back represent representative ORS
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
followed by llee thank you Mr chair uh
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
followup to representative Amy as far as
 
02:28:31.230 --> 02:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
identifying the players uh wouldn't that
 
02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
be easily done within annual audits of
 
02:28:35.710 --> 02:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
the I would expect so again that's
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
probably a Dr question rather than me um
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
I know that when I had my LLC I had to
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
file paperwork and my name was all over
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
it so obviously I would be subject to a
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
lean if I was in the hospitality
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
industry um but so again I don't think
 
02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily hard to signed mhm so
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
followup followup so businesses are
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
going to do an annual audit I would
 
02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
assume correct they have to I don't know
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
that the annual audit is public though
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
so again because we're talking about
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
private llc's right so I don't know that
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
an audit would be public like that but
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
your filings with the state are public
 
02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
so when the LLC has to file its
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
paperwork for bet BPT that's all public
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
documentation public these are good
 
02:29:14.590 --> 02:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
questions for Dr yeah I think we should
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
move on for okay yep very good thank you
 
02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:18.790 align:start position:0%
move on for okay yep very good thank you
representative

02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
lley thank you for taking my question um
 
02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
again I'm just confused by the by the
 
02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
terms of active and passive are these
 
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
when an LLC fills out paperwork to form
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
itself with the state are is are those
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
terms used again I already answered that
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
question for the chairman those aren't
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I'd be worried about putting
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
them into laws because we don't have it
 
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't use the word active
 
02:29:45.070 --> 02:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
and passive I struck the word members
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
making sure that the leans are only
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
applied to managerial persons of the LLC
 
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm getting at is is I'm
 
02:29:53.469 --> 02:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
02:29:56.429 --> 02:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
how law is concerned with Define
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
defining things and that we're all
 
02:29:59.870 --> 02:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
talking about the same thing and it
 
02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
seems like in this bill we're striking
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
member and your claim is that it's a
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
passive member but I don't understand
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
how the Dr
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
would understand which members were
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
active and passive unless it's defined
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere in
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
writing so again that's current law
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I just keep saying that it's on on
 
02:30:27.230 --> 02:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
line 11 the law already says um for the
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of this section operator in the
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
case of Corporations includes a
 
02:30:32.830 --> 02:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
president treasur D operators in the
 
02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
case of a limited liability company
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
includes any person managerial capacity
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the limited liability company that's
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
what the new law would read and that's
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
already current law we just struck three
 
02:30:47.190 --> 02:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
words from current law the words members
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
and an other that's that's what this
 
02:30:51.790 --> 02:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
bill does is Strike those three words
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
and leaves the rest of the existing law
 
02:30:55.389 --> 02:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
to make it so that it's the person in a
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity of the limited
 
02:30:59.710 --> 02:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
liability company which gr must be able
 
02:31:02.670 --> 02:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
to know because it's a current
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
law so the question follow up is this I
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
mean again so is this a Dr question
 
02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
follow question is your
 
02:31:16.349 --> 02:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
intention it I'm trying to true the
 
02:31:19.389 --> 02:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
presentation with the rules with the
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
words that are used in the bill because
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
current law says members and and I know
 
02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
what a member is because that's defined
 
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
and when we fill out paperwork as an LLC
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
it says members so I understand what a
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
member is so to strike that it sounds a
 
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
little bit like people who stand to make
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
profit are
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
protected from being liable for a tax
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
bill that is due and that those people
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
aren't responsible the only people who
 
02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
should be held responsible are the
 
02:31:55.389 --> 02:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
people who failed to pay the tax bill in
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding that's your intention
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
with this bill intention on private lean
 
02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
is to say that it includes any person in
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
a manager capacity of the LLC they're
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
liable for the lean that is my intent
 
02:32:12.910 --> 02:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
okay so it doesn't matter who is making
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
profit from the business it's my intent
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
to make the people responsible who pay
 
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that run the business to be
 
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for the lean and be held for
 
02:32:24.750 --> 02:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
the lean that because it didn't get paid
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay I just am confused because we have
 
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
a thing called a business profits tax
 
02:32:34.269 --> 02:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
where we tax profits so thank you okay
 
02:32:36.469 --> 02:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:39.309 --> 02:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
Senator uh next I we got
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
ve thank you uh Mr chairman man and
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
record my name is Henry veu and I'm here
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire lodging
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
and Restaurant
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
Association um the association uh is the
 
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
one that asked Senator Lang uh to put
 
02:33:09.309 --> 02:33:09.319 align:start position:0%
the bill in um and what I thought was
 
02:33:09.319 --> 02:33:10.150 align:start position:0%
the bill in um and what I thought was
pretty

02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
simple um I think has raised a lot of
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions you can see here um but here
 
02:33:19.389 --> 02:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
here's the instance that we are trying
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
to addess and this is really going to
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
impact the small
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
operators uh so an instance where John
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
wants to start a
 
02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant John uh asks his parents for
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
some money to help open the
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant um John is obviously the one
 
02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
in the managerial
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
John doesn't pay the rooms of males
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
tax um under today's uh scenario with
 
02:34:05.590 --> 02:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
this uh Dr can go after John's assets
 
02:34:07.870 --> 02:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
and the parents assets even though the
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
parents aren't really involved in the
 
02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:12.030 align:start position:0%
parents aren't really involved in the
day-to-day

02:34:12.030 --> 02:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
day-to-day
 
02:34:16.349 --> 02:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
operation um which is different from a
 
02:34:19.269 --> 02:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
corporation because under the statute
 
02:34:19.279 --> 02:34:20.830 align:start position:0%
corporation because under the statute
today

02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:21.750 align:start position:0%
today
it

02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
says for the purposes of this
 
02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:26.590 align:start position:0%
says for the purposes of this
section

02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
operator uh which is going to be the
 
02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
entity that's going to be responsible
 
02:34:35.550 --> 02:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
for the tax operator in the case of a
 
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
corporation includes the president
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
Treasurer and any other person in a
 
02:34:44.269 --> 02:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity of S corporation so
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's what's in the current law and
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
then it says operator in the case of a
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
limited liability company includes
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
members which the parents would be and
 
02:34:58.870 --> 02:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
any other person in a managerial
 
02:35:02.349 --> 02:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
capacity of the limit liability company
 
02:35:05.469 --> 02:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
so we're just trying to put Corporation
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
and an LLC on the
 
02:35:13.950 --> 02:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
same um footing with regards to uh
 
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
potential tax lean uh for unpaid taxes
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
um you can ask the a lot of these
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions I think you should ask the
 
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
department um in terms of how do they
 
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
figure out who's in a managerial
 
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
capacity um I think they are best to
 
02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
answer that um I don't think this occurs
 
02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
a lot um and when we're talking about
 
02:35:41.550 --> 02:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
llc's we're talking about smaller
 
02:35:44.429 --> 02:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
operations uh I think any unpaid taxes
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
from a corporation potentially could far
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
exceed what you would potentially occur
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
in an LLC so that's the instance that
 
02:35:58.389 --> 02:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
this is trying to uh address and thank
 
02:36:02.269 --> 02:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
you represent elme the difference
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
between corporations other difference
 
02:36:07.269 --> 02:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
between the corporations and
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
llc's is that
 
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
a on I I've known in people that have
 
02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
set up uh one of them 25 llc's
 
02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
and I know that people set up one LLC
 
02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
for the parking garage and another LLC
 
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
for the lot and another uh LLC for the
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant and another for the hotel on
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
so that they'd protect one from the
 
02:36:40.349 --> 02:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
other when someone was suing and doesn't
 
02:36:43.950 --> 02:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
that apply in this case also that you
 
02:36:47.070 --> 02:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
could have you could have an
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
LLC that uh for a restaurant that had
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
subdivided all the other functions of it
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
and you couldn't put a lean on anything
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
except the restaurant
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
money I'm not sure I understand the
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
question the question is couldn't that
 
02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
occur where again on if if um somebody
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
set up a restaurant but on the parking
 
02:37:26.309 --> 02:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
lot for that restaurant was in a
 
02:37:26.319 --> 02:37:27.389 align:start position:0%
lot for that restaurant was in a
separate

02:37:27.389 --> 02:37:27.399 align:start position:0%
separate
 
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
LLC and a third part of it um the the
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
food provision was another
 
02:37:39.469 --> 02:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
LLC on and so forth that when you put a
 
02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
lean on it the only thing you could put
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
it on was the Central Restaurant rather
 
02:37:48.429 --> 02:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
than all the other parts of what is one
 
02:37:48.439 --> 02:37:51.469 align:start position:0%
than all the other parts of what is one
business

02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
um again uh this what what we're trying
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
to address is an

some money in there and uh this is just
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
to try to protect that type of
 
02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
investment represent Ellery thank you
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question we're
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
talking about llc's only in this
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
particular instance yes
 
02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:30.510 align:start position:0%
particular instance yes
304

02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
304
 
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
c23 already exempts members and managers
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
or directors from liability all
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
liability any debt any
 
02:38:43.150 --> 02:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
source so that is the cas what it says
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
in law except when it when it comes to
 
02:38:51.269 --> 02:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
the rooms of males tax um so we so I I
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
get what you're saying we had uh one of
 
02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
the Premier tax attorneys at the she
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
Infinity Law Firm who practiced this
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
this stuff and he says yes what exactly
 
02:39:04.030 --> 02:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is true most people
 
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
when they think they're investing in an
 
02:39:09.790 --> 02:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
LLC that they are immune that they are
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the same situation you're talking
 
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
except when it comes to the rooms of
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
meals tax and you might want to ask the
 
02:39:22.030 --> 02:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
department that too so it is true except
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
for the rooms of meals
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
TXS follow up okay yeah that's a
 
02:39:29.950 --> 02:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
question I see them writing them back
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
so um I don't quite understand that
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
however what's your definition of a
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
manager I see Dunkin Donuts out there
 
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
offering shift managers
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
positions all of the the chains are for
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
them but it's it's not defined in anywh
 
02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
so I think the intent and again the
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
department can probably respond because
 
02:39:58.950 --> 02:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
its current law is someone in a
 
02:40:03.230 --> 02:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
managerial position of managing the
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
company represent Ames yeah I just
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I really think we
 
02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
need Dr up we're going around in circles
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
and we're not talking I agree to the
 
02:40:14.990 --> 02:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
enti that's really responsible for this
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
that has the history of interpretation
 
02:40:20.349 --> 02:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
of this phrase and so forth I agree
 
02:40:22.110 --> 02:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony all right
 
02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:23.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony all right
thank

02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%

assistant

02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
02:41:03.790 --> 02:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner I was formerly the
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
collections director for six years so
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
I've decided to accompany our te main
 
02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
Wong tax policy
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
Council good afternoon members of the
 
02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Keen Ming Wong tax
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
policy counsil with the new Department
 
02:41:22.670 --> 02:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
of Revenue um the the department does
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
not have a position on this bill um
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
however the department does have
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh the impact on the
 
02:41:31.469 --> 02:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill uh specifically as
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
what has been discussed uh today is uh
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of the collectability of taxes
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's owed to the state um essentially
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to to to back up and
 
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
probably just uh remind uh committee
 
02:41:48.910 --> 02:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
members that the M&amp;R tax is a tax that's
 
02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
Essen Al levied on the customers it's
 
02:41:55.309 --> 02:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
not a tax that is levied on the M&amp;R
 
02:41:58.790 --> 02:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
operators it's not a tax that's deit on
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the restaurants or the hotels
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's a tax that's paid by the customers
 
02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
02:42:07.790 --> 02:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
collected upon the customers paying the
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill so when uh when you go to a
 
02:42:12.190 --> 02:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
restaurant you pay your bill after the
 
02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
meal um that tax is collected at that
 
02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
point by The
 
02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
Operators and that tax is collected on
 
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
half of the state so it does not belong
 
02:42:24.429 --> 02:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
to the operators and the following month
 
02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
on the 15th of the following month that
 
02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
tax is then uh required by law to be
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
remitted by The Operators to the state
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
and essentially to the
 
02:42:38.110 --> 02:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
Dr um and so uh as as it happens
 
02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
potentially um people who uh operators
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
who have this money in hand um for
 
02:42:47.389 --> 02:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
whatever reason does not remit this uh
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
tax that has already been collected that
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
is that belongs to the state to the
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
state on the 15th of the following month
 
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
then U the Dr um and then if they they
 
02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
do report that that okay they they
 
02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
they've collected this amount of tax and
 
02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
they have limitted only x amount of tax
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
um there a shortfall um then the Dr
 
02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
would uh start the process in terms of
 
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
trying to collect the the outstanding
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
taxes that's also the audit process
 
02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
that's involved and let's say if um if
 
02:43:19.389 --> 02:43:19.399 align:start position:0%
there are operators who report rep a
 
02:43:20.910 --> 02:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
certain only a certain amount and pay
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
that certain amount but then um when
 
02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
there is an audit process that involves
 
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
and then the Dr finds out that there
 
02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
additional taxes that's owed and then
 
02:43:31.150 --> 02:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's another process however um
 
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
with the lean uh process that's uh based
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill here essentially uh this
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
lean is a lean on The Operators uh well
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the assets of the operat the property
 
02:43:45.389 --> 02:43:45.399 align:start position:0%
of The Operators it's it's a the section
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh once if you you read that
 
02:43:51.389 --> 02:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
carefully it's not a lean on the um
 
02:43:54.269 --> 02:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
assets of the U the LLC or or the
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
corporation it's a lean on the assets of
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
the prop of the uh of The
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
Operators um and then the Dr does go
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
through a lengthy process before any
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
lean uh is issued or attached to any
 
02:44:13.150 --> 02:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
kind of property um the the collections
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
division would make phone calls to um to
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
The Operators uh Dr the Dr the
 
02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
collections division would make field
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
visits to the operators asking them you
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
know just to follow up on the payments
 
02:44:28.349 --> 02:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
um letters would be issued out to the um
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
to The Operators to remind them to pay
 
02:44:36.429 --> 02:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
um and then the final I guess the uh uh
 
02:44:38.349 --> 02:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
the find the last alternative would be
 
02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
if that has the operators has not been
 
02:44:42.750 --> 02:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
responsive in terms of trying to work
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
with the Dr to come up with a payment
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
plan or or trying to have any kind of um
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
showing any initiative to to trying to
 
02:44:52.110 --> 02:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
settle the uh the outstanding amounts
 
02:44:55.309 --> 02:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
then and only then would a lean uh be
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
taken would be uh
 
02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:03.870 align:start position:0%
taken would be uh
registered

02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
um I will just I will just add um excuse
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
me um that with the collections process
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
again Keen mentioned all of the tools in
 
02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
our tool kit but there is also a level
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
of judgment that's applied that we do
 
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
look toward the active members if you
 
02:45:21.950 --> 02:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
will and I know the statute does not
 
02:45:24.510 --> 02:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
clarify and I'll kind of preempt the
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
question the Secretary of State's office
 
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
does not define who is active and
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
passive but we do um in contact with
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
that restaurant over months or any type
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
of period we do tend to know who is
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
managing that company and if it's a
 
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
storefront manager who handles that
 
02:45:43.269 --> 02:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
daily cash that that's responsible for
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
the deposit to the bank that's obviously
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
where we would start um we do dis
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
discuss the terms with any of the LLC
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
members uh active or not we explained
 
02:45:57.110 --> 02:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
the process to them it is written on our
 
02:45:59.429 --> 02:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
application and defined in all of our
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
forms that they would be personally
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
responsible when it does come to the
 
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
time where we need to collect we will
 
02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
make an attempt every time to work it
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
out from the bottom up I mean we want to
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
obviously contact the right person um
 
02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that includes negotiating you know I
 
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
understand that a parent may be involved
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of his or her son but they
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
also are an LLC member and do have an
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get involved in that
 
02:46:26.429 --> 02:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
business and to know the actions of
 
02:46:29.790 --> 02:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
their son but we would start with
 
02:46:32.269 --> 02:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
the represent spillsbury
 
02:46:35.550 --> 02:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I'm looking for an
 
02:46:38.429 --> 02:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
analogy and I think uh the distinction
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
that you pointed out is just so
 
02:46:44.910 --> 02:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
essential meals and rentals tax is a tax
 
02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
customer so the restaurant took or
 
02:46:53.309 --> 02:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
operator is in a custodial relationship
 
02:46:54.590 --> 02:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
Visa the
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
Dr right this is essentially the same
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
relationship as applies where you have
 
02:47:03.710 --> 02:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
an income tax a personal income tax and
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
withholding no we don't have that in New
 
02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's not so much in our
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse locally but when a similar
 
02:47:15.070 --> 02:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
situation occurs with the
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
IRS and a business has withheld
 
02:47:21.750 --> 02:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh the employees portion of their
 
02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:23.190 align:start position:0%
uh the employees portion of their
payroll

02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
taxes what exactly is the situation
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
there when it comes to C corporations
 
02:47:32.349 --> 02:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
for guidance here and I think part of
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on in this statute is the
 
02:47:37.150 --> 02:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
clearly Define
 
02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
operator it it includes a sentence that
 
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
says in the case of a a C corporation
 
02:47:48.990 --> 02:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot and it includes a sentence
 
02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
that says in the case of an LLC dot dot
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
dot but as our um the prior um speaker
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
indicated uh the whole essence of
 
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
Corporations is limited
 
02:48:07.750 --> 02:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
liability so the question as
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative oler suggested is you
 
02:48:11.990 --> 02:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
would start with the presumption that
 
02:48:15.190 --> 02:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
you can't pierce the corporate veil and
 
02:48:19.230 --> 02:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
assign liability to investors whose only
 
02:48:24.190 --> 02:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
interest is is monetary is so what does
 
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
the IRS do in exactly this
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
situation when payroll taxes are not
 
02:48:34.469 --> 02:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
remitted uh that's a very good question
 
02:48:36.910 --> 02:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
I I've never looked into that how the
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
IRS would address this um but I think
 
02:48:44.670 --> 02:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
what I can say is that uh this statute
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
has been around since
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
1995 uh and that is um 93 was when the
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first adopted the LLC
 
02:48:58.830 --> 02:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
statute and then in 95 it's when uh the
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the M&amp;R statutes that they looked
 
02:49:03.710 --> 02:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
okay there's this new organization that
 
02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is recognizing so um
 
02:49:09.230 --> 02:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
then this additional language is placed
 
02:49:13.070 --> 02:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
into the uh the lean statute uh in
 
02:49:17.469 --> 02:49:17.479 align:start position:0%
addition to what was already there for
 
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
corporations good history I appreciate
 
02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:21.269 align:start position:0%
corporations good history I appreciate
that

02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:24.229 --> 02:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
context uh representative PL yes I'm
 
02:49:26.469 --> 02:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the impact of this
 
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I heard uh assistant
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner lamir state that when it
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
does get to the proc uh the point of
 
02:49:38.429 --> 02:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
leans after having tried every other
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
aspect that a level of judgment is
 
02:49:43.389 --> 02:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
applied so you're going after the
 
02:49:45.550 --> 02:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
despite the law covering everybody that
 
02:49:47.349 --> 02:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
you would apply it to the sensitive
 
02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
managers the people responsible for
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
running the business so what what impact
 
02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
does this bill have on your
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
collectibility well there is some impact
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question but just to
 
02:50:01.229 --> 02:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
give you a big picture there have been
 
02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of the fiscal year
 
02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
about two 20600 collections cases
 
02:50:08.910 --> 02:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
created cases that flow down through an
 
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
assessment to collections of that amount
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
between July and now less than 5% are
 
02:50:17.190 --> 02:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals lead that have been
 
02:50:21.070 --> 02:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
placed out of that that pool 5% or less
 
02:50:23.269 --> 02:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
are meals and rentals and an even lower
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of those leans that have been
 
02:50:27.309 --> 02:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
placed on meals and rentals operators
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
are applied as LLC operators or to LLC
 
02:50:33.269 --> 02:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
members if you will so it's a very small
 
02:50:36.469 --> 02:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
pool um but it is a a tool that we have
 
02:50:39.110 --> 02:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
available to us again we've try
 
02:50:41.389 --> 02:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
everything to collect debt phone calls
 
02:50:43.469 --> 02:50:43.479 align:start position:0%
repeat phone calls field visits payment
 
02:50:43.479 --> 02:50:44.429 align:start position:0%
repeat phone calls field visits payment
plan

02:50:44.429 --> 02:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
options when we do get to the point of
 
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
placing a lean with a trust tax tax
 
02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
especially we do look to um those
 
02:50:56.309 --> 02:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
responsible parties as we call
 
02:50:59.670 --> 02:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
them I also just want to add that um I
 
02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
believe that our collections um efforts
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
are only as good as the information that
 
02:51:07.150 --> 02:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
we are able to get from the U The
 
02:51:10.269 --> 02:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
Operators um the information that we get
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh from uh from an
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
LLC operator uh we cross check that with
 
02:51:17.670 --> 02:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
the information that we have that we're
 
02:51:20.190 --> 02:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
able to get from Secretary of State and
 
02:51:22.349 --> 02:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
the information that is available from
 
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State for the annual
 
02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
return filings of the LLC is at most
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
probably listing of one manager or one
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
member um and then uh when The Operators
 
02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
apply for an uh for a M&amp;R license uh we
 
02:51:43.229 --> 02:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
do require that the operator or the the
 
02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
business lists down um all the uh the
 
02:51:49.469 --> 02:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
members and all the people with manager
 
02:51:52.510 --> 02:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
capacity um with the uh with with the
 
02:51:57.190 --> 02:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
form so um we can only do so much but
 
02:51:58.750 --> 02:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
we're relying on the information that we
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
we have um and then when when The
 
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
Operators are not responsive in terms of
 
02:52:07.229 --> 02:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
trying to work with us in uh for
 
02:52:08.990 --> 02:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
collecting a tax that has they have
 
02:52:11.309 --> 02:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
already collected and should be remitted
 
02:52:13.710 --> 02:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
to the the state just the following
 
02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
month um and we after we've gone through
 
02:52:18.590 --> 02:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
all the process in terms of trying to
 
02:52:20.910 --> 02:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
collect this money and contacting these
 
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
these uh operators um I think the final
 
02:52:29.710 --> 02:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
um is the the the final route would be
 
02:52:34.030 --> 02:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
to to issue a lean and then but to whom
 
02:52:36.229 --> 02:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
the leans would go to then we would just
 
02:52:38.030 --> 02:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
rely on that information that we have we
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
can't um I think representative Army
 
02:52:41.550 --> 02:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
just now presented a very good
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion in terms of should we require
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State to require that
 
02:52:48.510 --> 02:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
all llc's to register uh when they
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
register with the uh with the state or
 
02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
when they file the annual returns to
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
list all members with manager capacity
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful because um when we
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
contact the uh The Operators they may
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
not be providing us with all that
 
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
information so that we can specifically
 
02:53:06.990 --> 02:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
identify which specific member has the
 
02:53:09.630 --> 02:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
has the manager capacity and we don't we
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose out in terms of
 
02:53:12.870 --> 02:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
collecting the money from the state
 
02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
because that's the money that they
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
already took from the
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
customers thank
 
02:53:23.110 --> 02:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you for taking my
 
02:53:27.190 --> 02:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
question just want to get the numbers
 
02:53:31.790 --> 02:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
correct so um the scope of this is about
 
02:53:34.830 --> 02:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
5% or less of the people that need
 
02:53:37.349 --> 02:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
collections followup so it's not of all
 
02:53:39.229 --> 02:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
the businesses it's just that smaller
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
group that need collections followup and
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
then it's you know less than 5% you get
 
02:53:45.309 --> 02:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
to the lean
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
level right the entire group that I was
 
02:53:50.910 --> 02:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
referring to to is the collections so
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very small part of very small yes
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
portion that actually gets a lean placed
 
02:53:59.710 --> 02:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
follow follow up and I assume part of it
 
02:54:01.830 --> 02:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it briefly you do have
 
02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
options to offer them along the way oh
 
02:54:06.870 --> 02:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
definitely so it really is a a what do I
 
02:54:08.990 --> 02:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
want to say it's really the final
 
02:54:11.550 --> 02:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
alternative right okay that's helpful
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you repres now representative Erie
 
02:54:16.990 --> 02:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
Chun

02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
Chun
 
02:54:25.349 --> 02:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
remission failure to make that remission
 
02:54:33.550 --> 02:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.870 --> 02:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
activity uh it could be a criminal
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
activity I would presume it's
 
02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
statutorily required that meals and
 
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
rentals operators remit that tax monthly
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
okay follow up follow up if it's either
 
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
one but especially if it's Criminal
 
02:54:50.429 --> 02:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
there has to be an individual who
 
02:54:54.190 --> 02:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
willfully took undertook an action an
 
02:54:56.670 --> 02:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
individual who willfully undertook an
 
02:54:58.030 --> 02:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
action not the
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
LLC but an individual who knowing that
 
02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
money belonged to the state and whose
 
02:55:08.269 --> 02:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility it was to transmit it was
 
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
a sole
 
02:55:14.110 --> 02:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
individual not the LLC not any
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
member which is why 30423 take c23 takes
 
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
place to isolate them from an individual
 
02:55:23.950 --> 02:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
who was essentially stealing from the
 
02:55:26.389 --> 02:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
state it would be no different than if
 
02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
that individual was taken from the till
 
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
what you want what's your question
 
02:55:35.229 --> 02:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
representative is that correct okay
 
02:55:37.309 --> 02:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
02:55:37.319 --> 02:55:39.910 align:start position:0%
um yeah
um

02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
so we're not uh prosecuting attorney so
 
02:55:45.309 --> 02:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
I it's just very difficult for us to
 
02:55:46.910 --> 02:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question but I just want to
 
02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
go back to the point that um that was
 
02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
also mentioned uh during this hearing
 
02:55:55.389 --> 02:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
before uh that the uh the
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
llc's they have members and members have
 
02:56:02.190 --> 02:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
access to the the profits from the llc's
 
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
so essentially I'm trying to uh to
 
02:56:08.469 --> 02:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
imagine that this activity of lean we're
 
02:56:10.309 --> 02:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
not leaning anything more than what the
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
taxes owed or the interest of the
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
penalty and essentially this is I would
 
02:56:17.309 --> 02:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
aen this to a to a to an action of
 
02:56:18.750 --> 02:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
trying to discor
 
02:56:23.150 --> 02:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
the profits that's unrightfully kept by
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
the members or or whomever because they
 
02:56:29.190 --> 02:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
have access to the profits of of the uh
 
02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the LLC and um and therefore
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
returning that money back to the
 
02:56:38.070 --> 02:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
state thank you for the question
 
02:56:40.030 --> 02:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative ER it it's actually a
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
great Point um I will point out that in
 
02:56:46.269 --> 02:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
recent years when I was the collections
 
02:56:49.790 --> 02:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
director that the the there is not very
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
often just a sole individual involved
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
there could be a manager again who's
 
02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
taking those deposits daily to the bank
 
02:56:59.630 --> 02:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
um who reports those to you know um a
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
corporation or as rep representative Aly
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
pointed out it could be a string of ll's
 
02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
that you know are funneling that money
 
02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
we did have some re recent court cases
 
02:57:10.309 --> 02:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
where there were a number of individuals
 
02:57:12.229 --> 02:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
that were determined to be held liable
 
02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
in an L LLC situation and I don't have
 
02:57:16.349 --> 02:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
the references in front of me but I
 
02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
could get that information for you
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair follow up yeah yeah I would
 
02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes I I would appreciate that
 
02:57:26.269 --> 02:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
information and I would would appreciate
 
02:57:28.429 --> 02:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh
 
02:57:33.229 --> 02:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
chenan uh um comment as well uh the
 
02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
question then from your testimony thus
 
02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
far revolves back to an undefined term
 
02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
as to what a manager is or what
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
management is as because it it doesn't
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
exist either in the tax section or in
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
the LLC section there ain't no such
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:01.349 --> 02:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to know on the contract
 
02:58:02.190 --> 02:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:58:05.070 --> 02:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
sign for the
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
remittance if that does not put the
 
02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
individual signing the contract
 
02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
personally liable for the remission of
 
02:58:15.510 --> 02:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
remission of the funds it does it
 
02:58:19.389 --> 02:58:19.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't it does it does well
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's your
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
guy on the um I'll just clarify on our
 
02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
application it's a CD3 form you can get
 
02:58:29.070 --> 02:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
it online there are a number of boxes we
 
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
look for the person who's managing the
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
company LLC it could be you know a
 
02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
relative or it could be someone that's
 
02:58:38.469 --> 02:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
hired we do look for the manager as well
 
02:58:40.469 --> 02:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
as we include and the statute's clear
 
02:58:43.710 --> 02:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
that it includes members and anyone in a
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity it's not limited to
 
02:58:48.510 --> 02:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
the one person there's no manager in an
 
02:58:51.269 --> 02:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
LLC well there's a there there is a
 
02:58:54.670 --> 02:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
manager there can be a member managed or
 
02:58:58.469 --> 02:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
a a manager managed LLC there can also
 
02:59:01.870 --> 02:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
be no um managers uh well member
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
managers but there are passive investors
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
who put a manager at a storefront to do
 
02:59:09.150 --> 02:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
the daily operations we look for that
 
02:59:12.469 --> 02:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
person who's on location as well as LLC
 
02:59:13.990 --> 02:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
members who are behind the scenes
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
collecting those
 
02:59:21.389 --> 02:59:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
do you think it would help to
 
02:59:28.750 --> 02:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh further Define managerial capacity in
 
02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
this statute and if so do you have
 
02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
this statute and if so do you have
suggestions

02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:42.309 --> 02:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
thank I I think that would be helpful
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
but I think the uh the con the core of
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
dr's concern is just trying to
 
02:59:52.229 --> 02:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
to identify those people in the manager
 
02:59:54.990 --> 02:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and then
 
02:59:57.630 --> 02:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
um because right now as as as it
 
02:59:59.710 --> 02:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
currently stands we rely on information
 
03:00:01.950 --> 03:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State and then um
 
03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
information that's been filed with the
 
03:00:08.389 --> 03:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
Dr um and it it may not be as complete
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
as as uh as as we would like in terms of
 
03:00:14.030 --> 03:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
trying to when when when it comes to
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
trying to to administer the the
 
03:00:20.190 --> 03:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
collections of the uh of the taxes I
 
03:00:21.670 --> 03:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
have a I have a question and I'll come
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
back to you um so as it stands now the
 
03:00:27.309 --> 03:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
current law let's say you have an LLC
 
03:00:29.790 --> 03:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
there's five members they're not paying
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
the M&amp;R tax do you put one lean on each
 
03:00:35.790 --> 03:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
of them or how does that work the Lan
 
03:00:39.469 --> 03:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
gets placed in full on each member and
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
the LLC first The Entity first and the
 
03:00:44.190 --> 03:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
amount of the lean that's filed is
 
03:00:46.750 --> 03:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
against each member and the entity okay
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you we will work out obviously
 
03:00:50.750 --> 03:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
with you know payment arrangements and
 
03:00:52.229 --> 03:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
we will determine sometimes there are
 
03:00:54.269 --> 03:00:54.279 align:start position:0%
k1s that we refer to to see who holds
 
03:00:57.229 --> 03:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
what interests but we typically would
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
expect them to as members you know um
 
03:01:03.309 --> 03:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
work that out between them right thank
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:10.750 --> 03:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I just
 
03:01:13.950 --> 03:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh ask that you consider the question I
 
03:01:18.550 --> 03:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
asked and whether um there is
 
03:01:21.550 --> 03:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
some remedy to this uh apparent problem
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
of uh putting all the weight on
 
03:01:28.030 --> 03:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
the managerial concept managerial
 
03:01:31.590 --> 03:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
capacity concept that now is the core
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
concept for an LLB in terms of you're
 
03:01:39.269 --> 03:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
placing a lean and whether um whether a
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
better definition of that is uh going to
 
03:01:46.910 --> 03:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
move us to a better place or um a uh
 
03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:48.830 align:start position:0%
move us to a better place or um a uh
additional

03:01:48.830 --> 03:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
requirement for filing with you or with
 
03:01:57.229 --> 03:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State might uh might be
 
03:02:00.910 --> 03:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
helpful um and just uh I think if we if
 
03:02:02.670 --> 03:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
you could think about this and get back
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
you representative fellows um thank you
 
03:02:19.870 --> 03:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
um my concern is the concept of manager
 
03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
because in in most restaurant if you say
 
03:02:24.910 --> 03:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
if you say the restaurant down the road
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
who's the manager of that people think
 
03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
of it as being the person at the top of
 
03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
the totem pole of the
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
employees or it could be the owner but
 
03:02:39.389 --> 03:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
they're in that restaurant essentially
 
03:02:44.229 --> 03:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
most of the time and that if if somebody
 
03:02:47.469 --> 03:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant is diverting those
 
03:02:49.630 --> 03:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
payments you know I don't know somehow
 
03:02:51.309 --> 03:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
saying they're taking them and
 
03:02:53.790 --> 03:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
depositing them in the bank but they're
 
03:02:55.990 --> 03:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
not they're putting it in their pocket
 
03:02:57.670 --> 03:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
that could be the manager it could be a
 
03:03:01.309 --> 03:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
lower employee and that is that is theft
 
03:03:04.030 --> 03:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
and they should be prosecuted for that
 
03:03:07.389 --> 03:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the business which is
 
03:03:11.389 --> 03:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
owned by the partners collectively from
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's my way to make a distinction here
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
then they're the owners of the business
 
03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
and they're the ones that are
 
03:03:22.229 --> 03:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for what the manager does
 
03:03:24.110 --> 03:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
and all the other employees I mean you
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe they maybe the owners
 
03:03:30.030 --> 03:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
maybe they have somebody in the members
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
that tells the manager okay we want you
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
to give us the cash in that comes in
 
03:03:38.590 --> 03:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
every day I mean it's not now it's
 
03:03:40.830 --> 03:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
mostly credit cards but anyway suppose
 
03:03:43.229 --> 03:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
it was all cash and that we're going to
 
03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
take care of paying the bills you know
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
they've got an accountant somebody else
 
03:03:51.229 --> 03:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
is paying the light bills that so my
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
question is I am concerned that do you
 
03:03:58.990 --> 03:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
have that concerns about identifying
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
somebody as the manager it seems to me
 
03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
that it's it doesn't even belong in
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
here I thank you for the question
 
03:04:08.990 --> 03:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative I think it's important
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
that you acknowledge that there could be
 
03:04:14.229 --> 03:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
two types of managers right there's a
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
manager at the location you're sitting
 
03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
at a restaurant having dinner you ask to
 
03:04:18.670 --> 03:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
speak to to the manager you're going to
 
03:04:20.510 --> 03:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
get a person and typically that person
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the day-to-day
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
deposits if there was some failure to
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
remit those to the bank at that point
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
then yes they that person would be
 
03:04:31.550 --> 03:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
responsible but however what if that
 
03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
manager does deposit daily and it's the
 
03:04:35.630 --> 03:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
person in control the manager that's in
 
03:04:37.990 --> 03:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
control of the bank account or the you
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
know member that's in in control of the
 
03:04:41.550 --> 03:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
bank account that doesn't pay the tax so
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
we do recognize both we do ask for
 
03:04:47.710 --> 03:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
information upon the application the CD3
 
03:04:50.830 --> 03:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
for any members especially the manager
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
who's at the location again that would
 
03:04:54.030 --> 03:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
be the first
 
03:04:56.830 --> 03:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
Contact and the enforcement that we did
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
take would start at that
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
level representative spillsbury
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr chair this isn't so
 
03:05:06.190 --> 03:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
much a question of our Witnesses but it
 
03:05:08.349 --> 03:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
is in part I I think we've come to a
 
03:05:09.469 --> 03:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
point where it's getting kind of
 
03:05:12.429 --> 03:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
circular this is ripe for a very meaty
 
03:05:15.229 --> 03:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
work session and to be prepared for that
 
03:05:17.790 --> 03:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
work session now back to our Witnesses
 
03:05:21.389 --> 03:05:21.399 align:start position:0%
it would be extremely helpful to have as
 
03:05:23.630 --> 03:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
representative am
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
suggested any suggestions that you might
 
03:05:29.309 --> 03:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
have regarding definitions so
 
03:05:31.389 --> 03:05:31.399 align:start position:0%
particularly the definition of an
 
03:05:34.229 --> 03:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
operator and the definition of a manager
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
or managerial capacity in this context
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
but also I think we need to know what
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
does the IRS do in that analogous
 
03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
situation where effectively taxes are
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
withheld from employees and there's a
 
03:05:53.550 --> 03:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
trust relationship that's created
 
03:05:55.870 --> 03:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's criminal liability and all of
 
03:05:57.870 --> 03:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
the ramifications that go along with
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
that in federal tax practice regarding
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
corporate entities because I do think
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
that what we're what we're seeing here
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
unmasked is a lot of ambiguity in our
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
existing law about different forms of uh
 
03:06:16.510 --> 03:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
business ownership and Arrangement and
 
03:06:18.990 --> 03:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh how that relates to the corporate uh
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
limited liability and how that relates
 
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
to um tax liability and I think this
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
statute is essentially making an
 
03:06:31.389 --> 03:06:31.399 align:start position:0%
exception or going beyond the normal
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
understandings of limited liability and
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
frustration of our prior witness what so
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
I think what the bill is trying to
 
03:06:44.229 --> 03:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
address is fairly clear not making
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
passive investors liable to have their
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
homes attached
 
03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
um but I think that how we get there is
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
going to take some careful
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
work and the question was can you can
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
you bring that dat can you help us be
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
prepared for our work session okay you
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
leapley thank chair for taking my
 
03:07:07.349 --> 03:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
question um I think the other side of
 
03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple questions um around
 
03:07:13.710 --> 03:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
that side of the information I think the
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
other side that we need to make sure we
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
have information about is if we narrow
 
03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:20.349 align:start position:0%
have information about is if we narrow
this

03:07:20.349 --> 03:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:07:23.229 --> 03:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
legislatively does it make the dr's job
 
03:07:25.990 --> 03:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
harder and I think if they could clarify
 
03:07:29.269 --> 03:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
for us for I'm thinking for example I'm
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
not sure if this is true but I wonder if
 
03:07:33.550 --> 03:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
those members aren't listed
 
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislatively they're not listed in the
 
03:07:38.870 --> 03:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
law does that impact their ability to
 
03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the owners right the
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
members making sure that pressure is put
 
03:07:49.870 --> 03:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
on to get the answers that are needed so
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
I I want to make sure uh I'm not
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
convinced yet that this is an
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
improvement to the statute so I want to
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have all the
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
information from the Dr that's that's
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
going to reveal how if we narrow this
 
03:08:05.790 --> 03:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
legislatively it might make their job
 
03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
harder thank you um one one thing I was
 
03:08:12.150 --> 03:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
wondering is when I look at
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
corporations uh in the in the statute
 
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
here it talked about how I don't know it
 
03:08:20.910 --> 03:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
is exactly now but about the president
 
03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
or president Treasurer or other person
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
in a managerial capacity so if you're a
 
03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
if you're a stockholder in a
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
corporation this wouldn't apply to you
 
03:08:34.110 --> 03:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's an incorporated entity
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
then it's only the managers and the the
 
03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
correct I I think that's a very good
 
03:08:47.790 --> 03:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
question uh representative um so just
 
03:08:50.429 --> 03:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the um the wording of the
 
03:08:53.150 --> 03:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
statute it says for purposes of U the
 
03:08:54.510 --> 03:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
this section operated in case of
 
03:08:56.510 --> 03:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
Corporation includes includes the
 
03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
president Treasurer and any other uh
 
03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
person's in management capacity and then
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
when it's an LLC includes members and
 
03:09:05.110 --> 03:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
any other person's in manag Your
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
Capacity so
 
03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
um the the term just says includes it
 
03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:11.229 align:start position:0%
um the the term just says includes it
doesn't

03:09:11.229 --> 03:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:09:11.239 --> 03:09:13.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't
exclude

03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
exclude
um

03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
based on the interpretation he's trying
 
03:09:24.190 --> 03:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
to say that it doesn't exclude
 
03:09:26.830 --> 03:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
shareholders right doesn't what it
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't exclude the shareholders it
 
03:09:32.429 --> 03:09:32.439 align:start position:0%
would include anybody in uh any sort of
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility type position I see what
 
03:09:36.269 --> 03:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying the word includes yeah the
 
03:09:38.389 --> 03:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
word is includes okay but I think we
 
03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
also need to U just bear in mind that uh
 
03:09:43.349 --> 03:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
that the definition operator is defined
 
03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
up further top in the uh in the statute
 
03:09:47.790 --> 03:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh in the definition section who is an
 
03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
Operator Operator is a person who who um
 
03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
sister wood operates or manages uh the
 
03:09:57.830 --> 03:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
the facility itself uh either the hotel
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
or the restaurant so there is a
 
03:10:01.630 --> 03:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
definition for operators up top in the
 
03:10:04.710 --> 03:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
definition section thank you we will
 
03:10:06.510 --> 03:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
definitely be having a work session uh
 
03:10:08.349 --> 03:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
on this but uh we'll take a couple more
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative fellows oh no I
 
03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's not for a question for them I'm
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
just wondering if um we should for the
 
03:10:17.429 --> 03:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
work session get somebody from the
 
03:10:19.510 --> 03:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office because
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's where they file the the LLC
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
application because it seems to me we're
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:10:31.229 --> 03:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
possibly identifying people and that
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
would that are responsible for the LLC
 
03:10:35.950 --> 03:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
and that would be the place I would
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
up restive shamberg thank you Mr
 
03:10:52.990 --> 03:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
chairman two
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh reading the methodology
 
03:10:58.910 --> 03:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
here talks of the definition of operator
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:07.389 --> 03:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
managerial people have to show that they
 
03:11:10.429 --> 03:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
have real property to be able to file a
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
lean on when they fill out their
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
applications they do not they do not
 
03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:18.710 align:start position:0%
applications they do not they do not
second

03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:11:22.910 --> 03:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
question um you talk about
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
payments uh you you're going to have to
 
03:11:26.910 --> 03:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
update all necessary tax returns and
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
forms and electronic Management Systems
 
03:11:32.269 --> 03:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
is there any way that you can do it like
 
03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
Irving debit pay when you put your card
 
03:11:35.830 --> 03:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
in they take it right out of your
 
03:11:37.950 --> 03:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
checking account so when they deposit
 
03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
their money within the next 12 hours
 
03:11:43.070 --> 03:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's coming back to the
 
03:11:45.870 --> 03:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
state just take that under roll it
 
03:11:50.309 --> 03:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
all right I I would say my personal
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
opinion of that is the answer is no
 
03:11:55.830 --> 03:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
because they're taking it from the
 
03:11:57.550 --> 03:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
customer's credit card or customer's
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
debit card yeah um Mr chairman I meant
 
03:12:02.670 --> 03:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day they got to
 
03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
deposit it it's coming back out of the
 
03:12:06.560 --> 03:12:07.710 align:start position:0%
deposit it it's coming back out of the
representa

03:12:07.710 --> 03:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
representa
 
03:12:12.510 --> 03:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um I had three questions
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
that I started with and still haven't
 
03:12:21.550 --> 03:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
llc's yes yeah so in that case the
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
principal manager because they insist on
 
03:12:31.070 --> 03:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what is
 
03:12:35.630 --> 03:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
done could be somebody in DC or
 
03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:37.429 align:start position:0%
done could be somebody in DC or
somewhere

03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
on yes you're you're right so that's a
 
03:12:45.229 --> 03:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
complication and
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
llc's are based the whole idea was to
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
avoid liability for one business against
 
03:12:52.239 --> 03:12:53.269 align:start position:0%
avoid liability for one business against
another

03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
business so what do you
 
03:13:00.190 --> 03:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
do with somebody who
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
structured uh his restaurant so that the
 
03:13:03.359 --> 03:13:04.590 align:start position:0%
structured uh his restaurant so that the
parking

03:13:04.590 --> 03:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
parking
 
03:13:08.429 --> 03:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
lot is separate from the kitchen is
 
03:13:11.469 --> 03:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
separate from the dining
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
room goad in terms of where the leans
 
03:13:18.990 --> 03:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
go I I well I'm not familiar with this
 
03:13:20.830 --> 03:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
situation but I think what we need to do
 
03:13:23.229 --> 03:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
is also go to who is the the license
 
03:13:25.950 --> 03:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
oper who is the holder of the license um
 
03:13:27.870 --> 03:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
if the holder of the license is just the
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
one the LLC that manages the the the
 
03:13:34.630 --> 03:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant um and that would be the
 
03:13:36.910 --> 03:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
operator of the
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
um the restaurant you think then that
 
03:13:46.429 --> 03:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
that you could get into the lean on the
 
03:13:51.269 --> 03:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
parking lot and things like that if I
 
03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm sorry I'm going to jump in
 
03:13:54.389 --> 03:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's a good question
 
03:13:56.110 --> 03:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
because you're trying to show how that
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
separation occurs so they are protected
 
03:14:00.550 --> 03:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
from the liability right however in Mees
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
and rentals tax operators license we are
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
looking for the the the income and the
 
03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
revenue from the activity which is the
 
03:14:10.630 --> 03:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant portion or the the lodging
 
03:14:12.670 --> 03:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
portion so we would only put a lean on
 
03:14:15.229 --> 03:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
the LLC that represented the The Entity
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
that that collected the Reven yes not
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
the LLC or parking lot or another
 
03:14:23.469 --> 03:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
property even though they may have
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
structured that so that exactly if they
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
go bankrupt you can't get right so we're
 
03:14:30.349 --> 03:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
limited we're limited to the LLC that
 
03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
collects the tax and then the third one
 
03:14:40.429 --> 03:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
was in the LLC law if on the passive
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
investors are not getting paid for the
 
03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
first five years but you are not getting
 
03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:49.190 align:start position:0%
first five years but you are not getting
your

03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh your
 
03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
transfer you can't go after them ever
 
03:14:59.950 --> 03:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
for that period I think it's just the
 
03:15:02.590 --> 03:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
opposite that in this case we do we we
 
03:15:05.190 --> 03:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
don't look for with the trustees tax in
 
03:15:08.349 --> 03:15:08.359 align:start position:0%
&amp;r in this chapter in particular there
 
03:15:11.550 --> 03:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
there is no transfer necessary we don't
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
have to go through an audit process or a
 
03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
hearing to determine where those assets
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
go um we would necessarily just place
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
the lean regardless but You' you'd place
 
03:15:23.550 --> 03:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
the lane also on the passive investors
 
03:15:24.990 --> 03:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
even though they aren't getting any
 
03:15:29.790 --> 03:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
money back yes yes oh even if this
 
03:15:32.670 --> 03:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
passes I thought that was the why this
 
03:15:33.910 --> 03:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
thing was
 
03:15:37.510 --> 03:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
written well I think the idea is to
 
03:15:39.790 --> 03:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
again to negotiate with the person who
 
03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
is responsible and again that's where we
 
03:15:43.950 --> 03:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
start the lean is placed on the entity
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
first and that goes through a series of
 
03:15:48.269 --> 03:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
steps before we determine to even place
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
it on an individual or individuals the
 
03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
LLC is responsible and I think it's been
 
03:15:54.429 --> 03:15:54.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that's where the
 
03:15:57.870 --> 03:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility lies however if we are
 
03:16:00.269 --> 03:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful in our attempts to collect
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
from the LLC itself we after placing
 
03:16:04.990 --> 03:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
leans as well or realize that the LLC
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
does not own any property in this state
 
03:16:09.870 --> 03:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
because that is also a factor um then we
 
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
would look to the responsible parties
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
beginning with the manager at the
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
location and so on thank you thank you
 
03:16:19.750 --> 03:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
represent you set I should know this
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
03:16:22.950 --> 03:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
should know this off the top of my head
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
do we collect M&amp;R from airbnbs and the
 
03:16:30.510 --> 03:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
like we do it just opens opens another
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:38.269 --> 03:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
agreed okay are we complete any more
 
03:16:40.349 --> 03:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
03:16:42.750 --> 03:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
Dr I guess not thank you very much for
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:48.429 --> 03:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
cards I have no more pink cards
 
03:16:53.990 --> 03:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
for S SP
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
585 so I'm assuming there's no one else
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
that would like to testify seeing none I
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
585 okay
 
03:17:13.710 --> 03:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
so that completes uh our business today
 
03:17:16.110 --> 03:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
so the question I'm sure most of you
 
03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
have are when are we meeting again and
 
03:17:25.950 --> 03:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
um so right now the status is we have
 
03:17:28.750 --> 03:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
um just the the three bills that we did
 
03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
the public hearings on today are the
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
only bills uh left to do something with
 
03:17:38.229 --> 03:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
and for now um crossover being Thursday
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
we may get more uh but at this point I
 
03:17:45.229 --> 03:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
see no point of meeting next week um to
 
03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh to do these three uh most likely we
 
03:17:50.189 --> 03:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
should meet the following week which
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
would be the what is Monday Monday's the
 
03:17:56.510 --> 03:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
18th no wait a minute Monday's the 18th
 
03:17:56.520 --> 03:17:57.550 align:start position:0%
18th no wait a minute Monday's the 18th
isn't

03:17:57.550 --> 03:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
03:17:59.790 --> 03:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
it Monday
 
03:18:02.469 --> 03:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
next I mean I mean next
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
Monday let me look let's look at a
 
03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
calendar next Monday next so no I just
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
said we're not meeting next Monday next
 
03:18:13.950 --> 03:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
next week so Monday's the 22nd and
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the 23rd I'm I'm focusing more
 
03:18:18.670 --> 03:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
I think at this point on Tuesday the
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
23rd but I would ask that for now you
 
03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know especially till the end of this
 
03:18:26.910 --> 03:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
week so we can see what's happening hold
 
03:18:29.469 --> 03:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
Monday the 22nd and Tuesday the 23rd
 
03:18:32.349 --> 03:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
open with the idea that if we can get it
 
03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
what we need to get done at one day I'm
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
going to do Tuesday the 23rd so the odds
 
03:18:39.309 --> 03:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
of Monday the 22nd I think are low but I
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
want at least um you know so
 
03:18:45.469 --> 03:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
probably okay probably the next meeting
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
is Tuesday the 23rd excuse me Mr chair
 
03:18:51.550 --> 03:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
um that's school vacation week I don't
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
know if it's if it's absolutely
 
03:18:57.269 --> 03:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
necessary that we meet that week I I
 
03:18:59.469 --> 03:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
know I I struggled with that because um
 
03:19:01.870 --> 03:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
I I think I actually sent an email like
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
two months ago saying we would take that
 
03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
week off but my concern now is that that
 
03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
would then push us
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
into April 30th um uh and then we are
 
03:19:19.870 --> 03:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
just no April 30th is
 
03:19:22.189 --> 03:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
Tuesday um and then these bills have to
 
03:19:27.950 --> 03:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
be done by May 16th so there is still
 
03:19:27.960 --> 03:19:29.710 align:start position:0%
be done by May 16th so there is still
time

03:19:29.710 --> 03:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:19:32.189 --> 03:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know I don't want to commit
 
03:19:34.830 --> 03:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
right now to not doing Tuesday the 23rd
 
03:19:34.840 --> 03:19:36.070 align:start position:0%
right now to not doing Tuesday the 23rd
yeah

03:19:36.070 --> 03:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah yes repres Mr chair I
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's some advantage in
 
03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
meeting next week just to have the work
 
03:19:44.750 --> 03:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
sessions because there might be
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment requests coming out of that
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
which need time to
 
03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
prepare and but just have the work
 
03:19:55.349 --> 03:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
sessions well the I'm thinking that
 
03:20:01.389 --> 03:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
um the 20 uh I don't
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
know yeah we have till May 16th
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and I would have to put the request
 
03:20:12.670 --> 03:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
in today if there was the thing is
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
Thursday we might get more bills in and
 
03:20:16.030 --> 03:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
then I'll know we have public hearings
 
03:20:20.189 --> 03:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
as well so I'm I'm I i' prefer not to
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
not to meet next
 
03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
week any other any other
 
03:20:45.630 --> 03:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:45.640 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
everyone
