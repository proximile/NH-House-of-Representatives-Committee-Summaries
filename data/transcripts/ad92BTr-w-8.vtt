00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
of

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't have an extra copy I
 
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.230 align:start position:0%
um I don't have an extra copy I
mean

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.030 align:start position:0%
mean
yeah

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
okay sure so he just wanted to add um on
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
that Roman Roman numeral 4
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
A1 the the extra
 
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.030 align:start position:0%
A1 the the extra
line

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
um to say except when the officer
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
believes that that the animal's life is
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
in danger which makes pretty good sense
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and then in um number two under
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
cruelty to animals
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
livestock um a person charged in the
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill it says a person charged under this
 
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
section May petition the court to seek
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
an examination of the Animals by a
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
veterinarian licensed under RSA 30
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
332 hyphen B of his or her choice at the
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
expense of the person
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
charged and then we had a line that said
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
the person charged shall be made aware
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
of this petition in writing by the
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
arresting officer which which didn't
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
make any sense and I think that was a
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
drafting error so what the commissioner
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
suggested in his paper here to change
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
that line to read the person charged
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
shall be made aware of this right in
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
writing by the arresting officer sure
 
00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
which makes a whole lot more sense so so
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
um now we had in the bill right
 
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.910 align:start position:0%
um now we had in the bill right
underneath

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
underneath
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:54.389 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:57.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
charts got documents we working from now
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
the bill right the commission statement
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
and your I wanted to add a based on
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I wanted to add another
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
section number three that says if a
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
person is charged under this section and
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
is presented with any documents to sign
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
they must be given a full and honest
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
explanation of the contents of the
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
document and must completely understand
 
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
what it is they are giving their
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
permission for with their signature I
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
think that's very important yeah because
 
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
um clearly uh you know in some instances
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
people may be asked to sign something
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
they're under duress they don't know
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on they don't have a full
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of what it is they're
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
signing and then we have a situation
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
where which occurred which occurred yeah
 
00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759 align:start position:0%
which I think would be so that's that's
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
a a third part of this that I wanted to
 
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.110 align:start position:0%
a a third part of this that I wanted to
add

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
in okay I agree then we uh have uh two
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh item two in this bill which is a new
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph having to do with
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
alteration of confiscated animals
 
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
alteration of confiscated animals
prohibited

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.949 align:start position:0%
prohibited
um

00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
and what we had in the
 
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.829 align:start position:0%
and what we had in the
[Music]

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
Bill said that prior to a conviction for
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect under this section no
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
confiscated animal shall be altered
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
without the notorized authorization of
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
the owner from whom the animal was
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
confiscated nor such shall such animal
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
or animals be used in any manner to
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
solicit donations or to fundraise by any
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
individual organizations so what I would
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
do is strike that out okay and instead
 
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
do is strike that out okay and instead
put

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
in um item number
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
eight prior to a conviction for abuse or
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
neglect under this section no
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
confiscated animal shall be altered
 
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959 align:start position:0%
without the notorized authorization of
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
confiscated and that's it but but I
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
would want to then add uh an item number
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
three instead of in the bill it says
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
confiscation of animal I I'm I'm kind of
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
inserting something and then moving
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
everything down so I'm going to be re
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
renumbering the rest of the items that
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
are in the Bill okay but to say that um
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
an to create a new subpar
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph and call it profiteering on
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
confiscated animals
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited to amend RSA 644 colon
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
8 uh Roman numeral 4A by inserting after
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
subparagraph 8 the following new
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
subparagraph number nine that says prior
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
to a conviction for abuse or neglect no
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
confiscated animal or
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
animals may be used in any manner to
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
solicit donations or to fundraise by any
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
individual or organization that has
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
protective custody of the animals okay
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
so do you have the wording of 6448 or is
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
that part of 6448 would be the one that
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
we're just doing there in the prior page
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
prior to a conviction for abuse okay
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's where it comes from yeah
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
Peter this is the um 644 the bill and I
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
put in in yellow the changes from the
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner and
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
heard

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
um so that way we're putting in we're
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
adding in with this
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
section this item number three in the
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill we're adding in a new sub paragraph
 
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.110 align:start position:0%
bill we're adding in a new sub paragraph
regarding

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
profiteering okay I don't know what the
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
legal definition for properer is but it
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
sounds if it is what it sounds like well
 
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:25.950 align:start position:0%
sounds if it is what it sounds like well
let's

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
look so 644
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
in the criminal
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
code colonate is cruelty to animals oh
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
well maybe we can change the word
 
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.549 align:start position:0%
well maybe we can change the word
profiteering

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
profiteering
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
really Mr Bixby what say you to that um
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
mic how about I'm
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have my head around it yet
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah profiteering just sounded I
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
don't know kind of like to me yeah yeah
 
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um um how about saying financial
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
better so because it is it seems to me
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
to be pretty unethical that you know
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
people who take protective custody of
 
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.710 align:start position:0%
people who take protective custody of
the

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
animals would make profit off of I agree
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
the situation I
 
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.350 align:start position:0%
the situation I
agree

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
okay so then we would have to renumber
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh item number three in the original
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
Bill to be item number four and in that
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
paragraph um I know that in the first
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
line it says except as
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
provided in sub paragraph
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
B any appropriate law enforcement
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
officer um um and it says or animal
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
control officer and what uh we were
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
suggested to by Farm Bureau was to add
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
in Municipal Animal control officer so
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
that um so that's a a word that they had
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to be added in there to make it
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
more clear okay uh the Animal control
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
officer who's doing this and then
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
we have some wording that says the
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
officer shall provide for Proper Care
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and housing of any animal taken into
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
protective custody under this paragraph
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner had um requested
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we add in the line that says unless
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
charges have been filed the animal or
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
animals shall be returned to the owner
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
or caretaker upon
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
request so that way
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know if if they've been taken into
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
protective custody and within this this
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
time period if
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
no uh charges have been filed then uh
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
the the owner has right to take their
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
animals back presumably the charges get
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
filed early in this whole process yeah
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
okay yeah right so so one one challenge
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
is the distinction between
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh filing charges and uh having probable
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
cause uh so uh
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not quite sure how that
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
distinction so if uh so in a a potential
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
situation would be that uh there the the
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
owner was not present and animals were
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
found to be in a uh IM danger in
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
imminent danger and uh that that D that
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
that situation could likely have been
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
the result of um either neglect either
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
negligence or or Worse on the part of
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
the owner um if um so the but under
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
protective custody they wouldn't be
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
removed because of the potential crime
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
they'd be removed because in order to
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
preserve the health of the animals so uh
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
if there is a potential crime that
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
requires some further
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
investigation and uh so I think that uh
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps Al Another as another either far
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
charges filed or a warrant that
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
specifies probable specifying probable
 
00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
specifies probable specifying probable
probable

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
probable
 
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.710 align:start position:0%
probable
cause

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
cause
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not quite sure how to do that
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of legal language it's the
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not my strong point
 
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm better with h question yeah it's a
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
James far question so you're saying that
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
unless charges have been filed and then
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
you would want to insert something that
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
says or a warrant a a warrant
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
establishing probable cause or a
 
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.269 align:start position:0%
establishing probable cause or a
warrant

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
I mean the timing of all that confuses
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
me because in the case in the Lee case
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
um things sounded like got
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
accelerated um and I'm trying to imagine
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
how you get a warrant in
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
time so
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
um there are so basically there are two
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
there are two paths that that these that
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
this can go down one is that situation
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
is observed and observed by whom does it
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
matter it doesn't matter a situation is
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
observed the police are alerted
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
and they do an initial investigation
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
which would not which could not
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
initially involve going on the property
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
it it would have to be you know looking
 
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
at it from some distance uh because they
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a warrant to be on the
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
property and when they when they observe
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
from some distance if and and gather
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
other evidence that can be gathered
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
without being on the property they if
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
the if it seems like there is a
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
sufficient likelihood that there is a
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
you that a crime is being committed they
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
could go to the court and request a
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
warrant and they would have to uh list
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
probable cause on that warrant at which
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
point they could they could you know
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
they could um bring that warrant to the
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
property and that would give them legal
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
permission to be there um and uh at
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
which point they could then legally
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
seize animals as evidence in order to uh
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
determine if there was a an actual crime
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
was being committed uh that's one situ
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
that's one situation and under current
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
law there needs to be a status hearing
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
within 15 days uh in in order to or uh
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
and then in order to um determine the
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
disposition of the animals and um and
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and other aspects of the case which
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
I you know I it's been six years since I
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
worked on this so I don't remember the
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
details but uh so that's one SI that's
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
one situation the other situation is
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
they arrive at a at the location where
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
they've been alerted to animals that are
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
not being properly cared for the owner
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
is not present and uh they are and it's
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
the animals are in imminent danger and
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
they remove the animals for the animals
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
health so and they don't need a warrant
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
for that they don't need they don't need
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
a warrant for that uh so quite a
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
determination to make from John Q
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
public right so but but there is so um
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
on the other hand you if and one of the
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
the an example that the commissioner
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
brought up was that the
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
owner uh had been you know was um you
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
know in a in an accident and uh
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
incapacitated unable to say please
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
someone go care for my animals and the
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
animals are there they and they're
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
suffering from lack of care there is no
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
crime whatsoever being committed but the
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
animals need to be cared for right uh
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
and because of property rights issu use
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
the animals can't be cared for by an
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
someone that the author the owner does
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
not author authorize on the property so
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
they need to be and is incapable of
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
authorizing right yeah so so that's a
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
situation where it's the protective
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
custody would be purely for the sake of
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
the animals and there's no there's no
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
indication that any crime at all has
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
happened right uh so that's one purpose
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
of this in your earlier scenario I I'm
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
trying to Envision that somebody who's
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
not on the property can make that kind
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
of assessment law enforcement or anybody
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
else um I doesn't seem very likely to me
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
well um this is a little bit outside of
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
my my wheelhouse yeah but but but but
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
but it but but there is this you know in
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
order to in order to do the seizure
 
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.630 align:start position:0%
order to in order to do the seizure
under

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
um which one is it the animal cruelty
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.909 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
the um in order to do it under that
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
statute I I I need to pull up my copy of
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
the statute to get the references right
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
but in order to do it under as a
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
criminal initial criminal action the um
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
you need to have there needs to be a
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
warrant in prob probable cause and I
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
don't know the deal details of how
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
that's established I think I think we
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
who

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
thank you one of the things that came up
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
in our hearing that you weren't able to
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
attend is that a veterinarian who knows
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
the animals and has perhaps treated the
 
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:22.519 align:start position:0%
animals might be in a better position to
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
animals I don't I don't see a
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
professional having a conflict they make
 
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.630 align:start position:0%
professional having a conflict they make
a

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
determination you know on the basis of
 
00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:45.990 align:start position:0%
determination you know on the basis of
their

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
um office
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
I also have aine
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
youed sure
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
sure copies this is something that I
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
send to all of you chair to send it to
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
you but it just gives you that didn't
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
happen overnight it wasn't day right no
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
that so with this
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
confiscation so with this confiscation
 
00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:42.389 align:start position:0%
confiscation so with this confiscation
of

00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
animals um this is does not say anything
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
about a um you going to speak up any if
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to be heard this doesn't
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
say anything that they can't it sounds
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
like they could be removed by um an
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
animal control a force enforcement
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
officer and nothing about a veterinarian
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
being present well that's probably in a
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
it where's the veterinarian mentioned uh
 
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.909 align:start position:0%
it where's the veterinarian mentioned uh
okay

00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
so license just saying B Part B
 
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.389 align:start position:0%
so license just saying B Part B
investigating

00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
officer shall be accompanied by a
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
veterinarian but that's not the removal
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
about be patient with us we have
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
multiple documents and um revisions I'm
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
just saying that this doesn't mention
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
that but if it is something that
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
remember these are only additions right
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
oh yeah these are additions so we have
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'm looking forward to
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
putting all the Amendments together you
 
00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
know and we'll be able to follow it a
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
little more easily challenging to try
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
and go back and forth
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
um what you have you had mentioned Peter
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
in in this uh item number four
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
confiscation of
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
animal um in the middle of the paragraph
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
there we we added the the line from the
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner who he said unless charges
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
have been filed animal shall be returned
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the owner or caretaker upon request
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
and after that unless charges have been
 
00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
filed or a you wanted to add in or a
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
warrant establishing probable cause has
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
been s sought or issued issued
 
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
been s sought or issued issued
okay

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
okay so this gives the um the owner the
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get their animals back if
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
there are no charges filed or if there's
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
no warrant or anything yes right okay so
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
so so that's the the situation where say
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
the owner was incapacitated and uh wakes
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
up in the hospital and says oh my gosh
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
my animals and contacts you know someone
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
who can who can act on it um that you
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
and and and take care of them that would
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
be um that would or or some other some
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
other situation where where there was
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's clearly no fault in there's no
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
crime involved it was simply a matter of
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh there was some intervening
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
circumstance in that case doesn't have
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
to be incapacitation right it doesn't
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
need to be incap incapacitation it can
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
be you know some some intervening
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance that made it impossible for
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
them to get back to their animal well
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
should we then say shall be returned to
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
the owner or their design yes okay
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
because um the owner may not in fact be
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
able to personally care for them but um
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
can provide a design okay all right so
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
then um additional if we move
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
oh yeah when they're the
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
there's what you said line
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
20 yeah of the so when when you cut that
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
in cut it in it knocked out the
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
right let
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
me nice to know that our bills are being
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
carefully read so we have to take that
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
and then the owner or caretaker it
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
should be put in
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
here as an former English teacher I can
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
tell you that the the three theirs
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
long no well punctuation was a lost
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
page okay got that that fixed thank

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
um okay so then after that line it says
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
striking out the words or Society May
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
dispose of the animal in any lawful and
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
Humane manner as if it were the rightful
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
owner if after 14 days the officer or
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
the officer's Department determines a
 
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
change charges should be filed under
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
this section the officer shall petition
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
the court and um the commissioner says
 
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.150 align:start position:0%
the court and um the commissioner says
here

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
line is it on that line page
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
two page
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
two item
 
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
four e to seven yeah here that um an
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
owner or an animal taken into prot
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
protective custody shall have the right
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
to have the animal examined by a
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
veterinarian licensed under RSA 332b of
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
his or her choice at the expense of the
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
owner so that was in the uh italics and
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
Bold and the commissioner's comments
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
were um on page two the sentence
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
beginning on line five and ending on
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
line seven is not consistent with the
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
requirements of Roman numeral 4 A2 even
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
placing the same sentence here would be
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
redundant as Roman numeral 4 A2 would
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
apply to any charges which result from
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
the animal initially being taken into
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
protective custody so this sentence
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
should be removed because he's saying
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's a redundant thing yeah I had a
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
question mark next to that suggest
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
because I was having trouble following
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
because in Roman numeral 4 A2 it
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
specifically says a person charged under
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
this section May petition the court to
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
seek an examination of the Animals by a
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
Veterinary licensed under RSA 332 hyen B
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
of his or her choice at the expense of
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
the person charged so we've already said
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to say it again right
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
so the so um I don't know if it makes
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
sense I mean it from a lay person
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint it would make sense to have
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
something here saying that uh if the um
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
if it's determined that charges should
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
be filed then the um the provisions of
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh 4 a uh and 4 a and 4 a a uh are get
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
reverted to or something like that so
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if that I don't know if
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
legally yeah that would be a question
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
for OLS will we have time to send this
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
TOS oh yeah I'm GNA be going to talk to
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
them because I in terms of
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't put that in there it
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
might just seem like an absence yeah and
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
that and that someone might not
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily realize oh this is you know
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
this now reverts to uh to 4 a section uh
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
even though you know a lawyer would
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
recognize that probably maybe no but I
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't think that I don't think that a
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
police officer would necessarily notice
 
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.750 align:start position:0%
police officer would necessarily notice
that

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
okay I'm G to put in my note here
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and then the next comment from
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner which I didn't quite
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
um we had this next Item B that says for
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
purposes of that's on item line eight on
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
page two for purposes of sub paragraph a
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
the investigating officer for livestock
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a fine in RSA 427 colon 38 Roman
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 shall be accompanied by a
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
veterinarian licensed under RSA 332 henb
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
or the state veterinarian or their
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
design Who Shall Set the probable cause
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
criteria for taking the animal or
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
animals and uh the commissioner
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
said this does not have the language to
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
allow for extenuating
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances if this item Remains the
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
language should be consistent with the
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
suggestion made in Roman numeral 4
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
A1 which
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
says any person charged with animal
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
cruelty under paragraphs 3 or 3A may
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
have his or her animals confiscated by
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
the arresting
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
officer um however as this section only
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
allows for protective custody when quote
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
there is a clear and imminent danger to
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
the animal's health and life this new
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
requirement would be inconsistent with
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
the purpose of protective custody so it
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
should be removed so he is
 
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
saying that this language in Item
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
B should be removed altoe because it
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have anything to do with
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
protective custody which is what this
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
comes under that comes under right that
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me because it that
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
that that would once again blur the
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
distinction between seizure for a
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
criminal under a criminal case versus
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
seizure or versus protective custom
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
custody which is not in fact a seizure
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
it is uh removing the animals for their
 
00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:39.790 align:start position:0%
it is uh removing the animals for their
own

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
protection uh to be returned when the
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
protection is no longer needed so so
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
this should be stricken Al together
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay so then the rest is pretty you know
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 26 on page two is
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward we don't do um
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
live running or
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
harness uh harness horse racing or live
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
dog racing anymore so that whole section
 
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
is fine to be
 
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.990 align:start position:0%
is fine to be
eliminated

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
um so then we we had
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
um c section
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
c where we at we added in the bill on
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
lines 27 to
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
29 that we had originally said in cases
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
where one or more lactating animals are
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
confiscated proof shall be provided by
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
the confiscating party to the attending
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and the owner or caretaker
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
that proper care and faciliity shall be
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
provided for adults and
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
Offspring um
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
and so I added in
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
pink additionally in cases of
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
confiscation no lactating animal shall
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
be separated from its nonwe Offspring
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
and vice versa so that way we don't have
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
babies taken away from mothers or
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
mothers taken away from
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
babies not sure that the vice versa is
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
necessary because okay that you you have
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
two two ele two things there and if you
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
separate them then you separate them y
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we don't need and vice
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
versa but I like the addition of the
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
sentence yeah okay and that's only you
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
know we don't want to also get confused
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
with dairy farming and how they do their
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
stuff over there this is only in cases
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
of confiscation is
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
that I think that the
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
nonwe covers that because when you're
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
talking about Dairy farming the
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
once the um once the calf is separated
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
from its uh from its mother you they are
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
not you know they've already it's been
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
separated as part of the the dairy
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
process it's not so that would be
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
essential that would be weaned and so
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know if the cat calf is being
 
00:46:16.829 --> 00:46:16.839 align:start position:0%
bottled fed they'll that's being you
 
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
know or that's still weaned from its
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
mother that was your concern and so does
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
that address that well I guess I would
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
but doesn't doesn't the term wean
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
include all of
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
that I thought so yeah I thought I mean
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
if someone is if a if if a if a baby is
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
weaned then it's no longer nursing right
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean I think that's and
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not the the mother is still
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
producing milk if the baby's weaned it's
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
y you have there addition so okay the
 
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.030 align:start position:0%
y you have there addition so okay the
the

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
whole part here number item C in cases
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
where one or more lactating animals are
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
confiscated proof shall be provided by
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
the confiscating party to the attending
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and the owner or caretaker
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
that proper care and Facilities shall be
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
provided for adults and Offspring
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
additionally I'm adding this in
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
additionally in cases of confiscation no
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
lactating animal shall be separated from
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
its non weaned
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
Offspring yeah I think that takes care
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
um then um we have this
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
language that Peter shared with
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
me we going down to e uh we're going to
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
talk about D oh okay because we have
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
here on
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
D no person natural or otherwise who has
 
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
initiated an animal welfare complaint
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:58.280 align:start position:0%

be present during such
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
investigation um the additional language
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
would to would be to say to protect the
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
Integrity of complaint
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
investigations and appropriate law
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%

or to assist during any complaint
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
investigation to sign a binding
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement intended to
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
protect any shared or confidential
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
information against unauthorized use
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
of such complaint provided that
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
information may be disclosed only to
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
officials with the need to know who are
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
subject to confidentially
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
confidentiality obligations so that was
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
the additional language well I don't
 
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
think that Cas no no not not that I oh
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
that was um from uh Rob Johnson sent me
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
that what does natural or otherwise mean
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
context I'm a natural person of the
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
Humane Society is a person under legal
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
definitions but it's not natural oh okay
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so basically and or
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
under under legal definition a person is
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
any entity that is capable of taking in
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
legal sense okay and the other either an
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
individual human or it can be a
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
organization yeah
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
right Madam chair what was the sign
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
binding agreement part could you read
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
me yes I I I had added in a section in
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning um as item number three in
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh section for for I thought this was
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
part of D that you were adding Rob
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
Johnson's no comments no okay we've I
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
added that in earlier to say that if a
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
person is charged under this section
 
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's on page
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
one if a person is charged under this
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
section and is presented with any
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
documents to sign they must be given a
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
full and honest explanation of the
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
contents of the document and must
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
completely understand what it is they're
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
giving their permission for with their
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
signature understood but the section
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
that you just read read from your
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
computer said something about a signed
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
binding agreement oh okay so the what I
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
um it was a long paragraph I got a
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
little loss so what uh what was said
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
here was the addition of the language to
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
protect the Integrity of complaint
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
investigations an appropriate law
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer shall require any
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
person natural or otherwise called upon
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
to take possession of any animal seized
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
or to assist during any complaint
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
investigation to sign a binding
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement intended to
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
protect any shared or confidential
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
information against unauthorized use
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
pending final adjudication or dismissal
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
of such complaint provided that
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
information may be disclosed only to
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
officials with a need to know who are
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
confidential confidentiality obligations
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
too I have you might have addressed this
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
later but I have one concern about uh
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
this um the section three about if a
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
person is charged under this section and
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
presented with documents I'm concerned
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
that are we in the bill now this in the
 
00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
beginning this this is in Judy's kind of
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
came in a little later on Section so I
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
just want to know if this has been
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
addressed but um that language needs to
 
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
have some sort of an equivalent under
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
the um temporary custody section also
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
because uh if someone's animals are
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
removed under test temporary custody and
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
they are presented with with documents
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
to uh that where would they would give
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
up uh ownership of the of the animal
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
they need to know exactly what they're
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
signing to because that's what happened
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
in the Lee case I sure there were I
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
Donal Lee didn't know what she was
 
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
signing no and uh she didn't realize she
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
was giving up ownership of her animals
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
she was not charged right so it needs to
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
be clear that um that uh you can't
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
Surrender Your animal no one can be put
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
in a position of surrendering their
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
animals either under a charge or under
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
temporary custody okay okay without
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
fully knowing what they're doing will
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
the same language obtain under the other
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
section I haven't figured out where it
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
should go I just I just know it needs to
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
be there fair enough okay so this this
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
has to be duplicated in another section
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
because because one is one is not one is
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
not necessarily one has to have the
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
protection even if one isn't charged yes
 
00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.470 align:start position:0%
protection even if one isn't charged yes
y

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.359 --> 00:55:06.309 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
are
are

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.589 align:start position:0%
 
AG

00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
in people are experienc
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
not to be of it it is unfortunate that I
 
00:55:31.039 --> 00:55:32.109 align:start position:0%
not to be of it it is unfortunate that I
have

00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:32.119 --> 00:55:50.190 align:start position:0%
have
a

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.829 align:start position:0%
 
Inge

00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
Inge
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
year um we received 681 complaints
 
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.270 align:start position:0%

medical bills you might think Lisa welc
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%

00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
vinar decision we are
 
00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:03.799 align:start position:0%
only we cannot get a search without a
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
police off so we have to have the
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
information work with the police to have
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
this happen we are not if the police

don't see it and the judge
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
I think that we just have to be careful
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the uning consequences of where you
 
00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.349 align:start position:0%
of the uning consequences of where you
will

00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
put because un was an option
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%

the other
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
concern is a civil liberties concern

but I would just say
that

ASPCA it's another animal organization
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
person's harass me is another person's
 
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
animal protection Mr Arenberg with
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
respect you know that we care about
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
these animals as well we are trying to
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
do by do right by them we are we are on
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
the same side but we have our job as
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
legislators is to make sure that the law
 
01:02:00.119 --> 01:02:01.789 align:start position:0%
legislators is to make sure that the law
says

01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
what our constituents want in terms of
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
protection and while the former speaker
 
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
said it's unfortunate that she may have
 
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
a conflict we do not have a conflict so
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
you and I know each other a little bit
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm an animal rights person but I'm
 
01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.039 align:start position:0%
also called by my constituents and by
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
the oath I took to write the law so that
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
it reflects the will of the people
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
comment I mean I'm just going to say
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
clearly we have a problem and I think
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
that maybe one of the problems
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
well we're not trying the case at all
 
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is is put in
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
some uh solutions to issues to some of
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
the problems that arose out of this
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
particular case and other cases that
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
we've heard too um like I said clearly
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and what we're trying
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislatively to do is to make sure that
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
those problems don't occur and that due
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
process is followed for for the owner I
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
mean just as much as there are
 
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
protections for animals which there are
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
in the law we also need to protect the
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
owners of those animals from um
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
with respect we heard Miss Dennison's
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and I asked her one question
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the owner of the
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
animals was treated honorably and is
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
there anything you would do differently
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
and she said yes to the first no to the
 
01:04:19.269 --> 01:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
second so we we heard her testimony you
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
can get it it's on tape okay well I
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't the purpose here is not to argue
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
um the purposes to try and and um come
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
for Madam chair yes I would like to

and the members of the committee uh have
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%

01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
from anyone else including myself
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%

01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
of the chair of the subcommittee yes
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
reminder okay um so where were we we
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
were on uh on
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral Roman numeral 5
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we well actually we had item
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
e the confiscation of any animals
 
01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
without the charging of the owner or
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
caretaker under paragraph 4 shall be
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
theft by unauthorized taking under RSA
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
637 Coen 3 that's to replace the
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
language that was in the original Bill
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh this is something that was uh
 
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
suggested by the
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh item e says the
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
confiscation of an animal without the
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
charging of the owner under paragraph 4
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
or the determination that the animal or
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
animal shall be taken into temporary
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
protective custody under this paragraph
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
shall be theft by unauthorized taking
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
under RSA 637 colon 3 so he wants to
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
replace that language with the
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
confiscation of any animals animal
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
animals without the charging of the
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
owner or caretaker under paragraph 4
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
shall be theft by unauthorized taking
 
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
under RSA 637 colon 3 so that's um a
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
simpler yes restatement restatement of
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
that yeah um then we have
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
see down
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
to so his last one was yep one one um
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
potential issue with that also is the
 
01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
question of um the
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh the you know what happens if there is
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
a warrant for with probable cause that
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
uh where the animals are being um taken
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
as evidence the charges have not yet
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
been filed oh okay uh so I think that
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be I that needs to be allowed
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
also so okay so the confiscation of any
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
animals without the charging of the
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
owner or
 
01:07:01.079 --> 01:07:03.269 align:start position:0%
owner or
caretaker

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
caretaker
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
or um without a warrant without a
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:17.029 align:start position:0%
 
warrant

01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay under paragraph
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
four shall be theft by unauthorized
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
um page three lines 20 to
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
end if the the language to provide an
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
exception in the ca the the
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner's comments to that
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
is if the language to provide an
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
exception in the case of confiscation or
 
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
protective custody is added in other
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
sections it would conflict with this
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
sentence that is um under in in yellow
 
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
okay if the sentence was amended to be
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
consistent it would then be redundant so
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
the sentence should be removed from the
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
section which is why I struck it through
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
um you got you you got that Peter yeah
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
got okay and then what I wanted to add
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
in was we had mentioned about adding in
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
the language for the cost of care
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
fund right so I'm putting in a new uh
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
item six in this bill a new
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph having to do with assessing
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
applications under the cost of care
 
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
fund um and I the use for livestock I
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
took the comments from the bill hearing
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
for that cost of care fund
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
okay um see it is have
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
thater so the comments for that
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
um had to do
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
with um the I know um Mr Johnson from
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau said that
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
um before funds are released there
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
should be a some sort of check off and
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
assurance that the experts were
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
consulted part of due process of the
 
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.030 align:start position:0%
consulted part of due process of the
animal

01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
animal
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
owner um and so the so yeah commissioner
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
J Jasper was saying that there should be
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
some sort
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
of ability to
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
assess uh the application of the cost of
 
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.349 align:start position:0%
assess uh the application of the cost of
care

01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
fund and that we would insert this
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
3A applications for reimbursement for
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
the care of livestock shall
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to the commissioner that the
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
livestock were seized properly according
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
to statute with assurance that
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with experience and
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
Professional Knowledge in the care of
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
livestock seized were consulted and that
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
proper due process was afforded to the
 
01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.510 align:start position:0%
proper due process was afforded to the
animal

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
animal
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
owner does that make sense to add that
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
in I think so yes yes because they want
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you know before they
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
reimburse for the cost of care that um
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
it's been done appropr it's been done
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately the seizure yeah that
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you're not making
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
additional add-ons Peter to lengthen
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
it's some clarity yeah complete and
 
01:10:59.719 --> 01:11:03.669 align:start position:0%
it's some clarity yeah complete and
clear

01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah well we did say we wanted to add in
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
a piece because that was relevant to
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
this bill right no I'm not saying yeah I
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
think I'm not saying that that's an
 
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate addition I'm just saying
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
that my general my
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
general take on it is that one should
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
use it key words as possible to indeed
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
make to get everything as clearly as
 
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
possible for sure
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
agreed okay so those those are the um
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendments to the
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill um incorporating the the um
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner's comments and then what we
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony too so so I'm just
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
sort of circling back to um the you know
 
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.629 align:start position:0%
sort of circling back to um the you know
who

01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
you the the potential the the issue of
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
um no person natur otherwise who
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
initiated the comp um a complaint uh may
 
01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
be part of the investigation and no
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
person uh who's called on to take
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
possession uh shall take part in the
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
investigation I think that might
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
actually I think that might be
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
problematic I think it's a little bit
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
too I think it it might be too broad and
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
um and sweep in too many you I I think
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
there there may in fact be unintended
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
consequences we do need our Humane
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
Societies to be able to take animals
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
that have been uh prop properly removed
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
from a situation and take care of them I
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I I think that one thing that that
 
01:12:43.629 --> 01:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
helps deal with the issue behind that is
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
if we remove Humane Societies as a uh
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
essentially from being deputized which
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
and I I think I'm which I I think it
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense to remove the the
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
deputization that exists in current law
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
because I think it should be someone who
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
is re uh re responsible in the change of
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
command to the government uh in a clear
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
way as in a law enforcement officer in a
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
town or in the state um but uh but I
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
think that we don't want to say that um
 
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
we don't want to to get rid of potential
 
01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.149 align:start position:0%
we don't want to to get rid of potential
expertise

01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
even if if there was if there has been
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
one case or two cases or three cases
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
where uh where procedures have not been
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
properly followed that is you know we
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't throw out the baby with the
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
bath water okay so what do you do with
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
the wording in that se to re that I I'm
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
respon okay so maybe I'm thinking then
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we can change this to say no
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
person natural or otherwise who has
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
initiated an animal welfare complaint
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
may take part in or be present during
 
01:14:53.629 --> 01:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
any investigation into such complaint
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
unless they have
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
um certain expertise or
 
01:15:00.639 --> 01:15:02.590 align:start position:0%
um certain expertise or
credentials

01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
to contribute to the I don't know how to
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
word that
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah pardon me so here's how the work
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
session works you need to be recognized
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
by the chair if she chooses she will
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
to well do you have do you have ma'am do
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
that well we're working on that in
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah yeah the only thing I was
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
cons um that commissioner Jasper said
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
they do not use they they have other
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
places that they put an livestock yeah
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
and not at the Humane Society was that
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
they have they have different places
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
where they can place
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
livestock I don't think that he was
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
excluding the Humane Societies as as as
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
a possible um place of housing I think
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
he was just saying that there there are
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
additional options places
 
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay well I I think maybe we need to in
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate some language that says
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
unless um
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
um unless they possess the
 
01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.870 align:start position:0%
um unless they possess the
expertise

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
necessary right I I I think we're
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
getting into a fairly sticky territory
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
here that's um and I'm not sure that
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
this part is necess is absolutely
 
01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.830 align:start position:0%
this part is necess is absolutely
necessary

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
for uh to do immediately I think that we
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
had talked about doing a study committee
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh that would look at the that would
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
look at the entire entirety of this um
 
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.590 align:start position:0%
look at the entire entirety of this um
uh

01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
6448 uh and I think that uh dealing with
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
that aspect of it might be put off
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
because I just
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
foresee just it it seems like there are
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
so many potential unint unintended
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
consequences to putting in that sort of
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition that it needs to have a more
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
thorough assessment than we can do in a
 
01:17:28.719 --> 01:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
thorough assessment than we can do in a
week

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
okay so do you want to strike that
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
language and then just add in um the
 
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
part that says to protect the Integrity
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
of complaint investigations an
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate law enforcement officer
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
shall require any person natural or
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise well that language that
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
um Rob Johnson sent me yeah okay
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:09.629 align:start position:0%
 
Sir

01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
Orin yeah that's why we're not quite
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
ready that's why we're we're yeah that's
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
kind of why I'm thinking I want to
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
strike that section D and just add in
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
though to protect the Integrity of
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
complaint investigations and appr riate
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer shall require
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
any person natural or otherwise called
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
upon to take possession of any animal
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
Seas to assist during any complaint
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
investigation to sign a binding
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement intended to
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
protect any shared or confidential
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
information against unauthorized Ed
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
pending final adjudication or dismissal
 
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
of such complaint provided that
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
information may be disclosed only to
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
officials with a need to know who are
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
confidentiality obligations I think that
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense to put that there instead of
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
um prohibiting people from participating
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
in an
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
investigation so I'm gonna we'll do that
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.310 align:start position:0%
 
D

01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
D
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
P

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
animal think about that be careful
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
animal back to the environment out so
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
something that we can into theill where
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
Chang be made the
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
envir to the animal and then no chares
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
have been done yet and petion
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
back in that same sitation took give
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
that thought
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
environment yeah we're trying to do so
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
much with this bill yeah
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'm actually thinking that that
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
might be something to put in at a later
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
time to um or a separate bill or a
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
separate bill at some other point yeah
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um I mean I think it's a fair point
 
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
for yeah it's a very fair point thank
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
you for
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.270 align:start position:0%
 
out

01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
sure okay um I think I think that's all
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
for changes that we could do uh for now
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
and and um I'm going to go to OS and or
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
what I can do
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
is actually go to OLS and give them all
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
the changes and we can talk about it on
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday when we have our work session
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
the bill is not going to be exact out
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
until the 18th anyway because there's
 
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
done oh we can do that he wants me to
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
spend my summering this out well you
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
won't necessarily be the one of
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
stud well I think I will
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
be okay I I'm not going to compete for
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
it no I
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:18.669 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh review the entire statute the review
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
6448 and what else okay so
 
01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:41.470 align:start position:0%
6448 and what else okay so
there's

01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
648 648 64
 
01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:50.350 align:start position:0%
648 648 64
644

01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
644
 
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
64 wait wait wait hold on a second right
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
I gotta see where you are here okay in
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
in in the statutes
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's we have there
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
are there's
 
01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:15.229 align:start position:0%
are there's
6448

01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
6448
 
01:23:15.239 --> 01:23:17.510 align:start position:0%
6448
by

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
are there's a set of Sub sub subsequent
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
form from
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
6448 a to g g with an AA there so that
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
red you one result of that might be oh
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
this just makes sense another part of it
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
might be oh this is something that is
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
you this doesn't exist anymore so we
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that so the
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
idea is to identify elements that need
 
01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:07.110 align:start position:0%
idea is to identify elements that need
to

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
be gaps in
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
logic things that might be
 
01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.790 align:start position:0%
logic things that might be
reorganized

01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
y to identify elements to clarify
 
01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.709 align:start position:0%
y to identify elements to clarify
reorganize

01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
reorganize
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
agult are the
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
statutes are statutes consistent with
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
current regulatory needs and practices
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
well hold on wait a minute you want to
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
send me that language oh sure I'll just
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
sure okay Kathy wants to study it before

you
said

01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we are on the
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
same yeah yeah yeah just not very good
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
no I I knew him 45 years ago at a tennis
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
camp and so he thinks we're buddies I
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
seen him 100 years but he's just not
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
very effective
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
angry and spouts off and doesn't do his
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
homework he's terrible
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
testify really I don't know why they
 
01:30:05.239 --> 01:30:06.550 align:start position:0%
testify really I don't know why they
keep

01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
keep
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
him he's not very good that's a mystery
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
not no but anybody who I don't know that
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
anyway so we want to talk about the
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
musling bill which this one this is 250
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
250 you know with this the only I just
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
want to say something about this meat
 
01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
bill yeah you know um I think that when
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
they process meat in these big um
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
um Factory you know like a big slaughter
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
houses they do it mostly by Machine
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
whereas you know the ones that are local
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
are doing it some machine but mostly
 
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
hand so I think that there's better um
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:12.679 --> 01:31:14.590 align:start position:0%
you know
practices

01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
anyway so with this
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
um with this musling
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill um obviously this needs need some
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment were you working on an
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
this I don't remember
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
um but I know that we we said that um we
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to change this to have some kind
 
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
of thing that
 
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
says that they could uh
 
01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.910 align:start position:0%
says that they could uh
regulate

01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
locally only with a bite history or
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
where you know
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire law has two places
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
where this could be added was my note to
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
said all right let's see I know I know
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've got legislation already having to
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
do with bites and there was something
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
that Stacy
 
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
over yeah she's sent a whole list of um
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
two bills in her statement that I looked
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
um it's a
 
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
um it's a
model

01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
um International Municipal Lawyers
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
Association model of dangerous dog
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
ordinance it's quite detailed but upon
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
review May flag issues not contemplated
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
in hb250 authorizing municipalities to
 
01:33:26.159 --> 01:33:27.189 align:start position:0%
in hb250 authorizing municipalities to
muzzle

01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
muzzle
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
dogs AKC has a white paper on breed
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
discrimination that includes model state
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
law for your consideration as to what
 
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines should be useful to New
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cities and towns dealing with
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous dog
 
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.030 align:start position:0%
dangerous dog
issues

01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
um but I think for the most part the
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
concern with
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah we want to give well first of
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
all we've got we've got laws on the
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
books for
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
um vicious dogs let me go look that up
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
section you know I struggled with the
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
you get to bite somebody once before you
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
have to do it but I guess there's no way
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
around that 466 colon 31 y dogs a menace
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
a nuisance or
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
vicious so okay so let me write this
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
down this is
 
01:34:56.189 --> 01:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
all right under this section a dog is
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
considered to be a nuisance a menace or
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
vicious to persons or to property under
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
any or all but not limited to the
 
01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
following conditions a if a dog is at
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
large which means it's off the premises
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
of the owner or keeper and is not under
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
the control of any person by means of
 
01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
personal presence and attention as well
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
as reasonably control the conduct of
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
such dog unless accompanied by the owner
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
or custodian this subparagraph shall not
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
include a dog which is being used for
 
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
hunting supervised competition
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
exhibition or training for such
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
activities if accompanied by the owner
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
or custodian or a dog which is guarding
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
working or hurting livestock as defined
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
in RSA 21 colon
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
34A Roman numeral 2 A4 meaning that the
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
owner or custodian must be able to see
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
or hear the dog or have a reasonable
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge of where the dog is hunting or
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
hurting or where training is being
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
conducted or where trials are being held
 
01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
provided that such dog does not have to
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
be within sight at all time okay so that
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
just gives you the definition of if a
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
dog is at
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
large okay because Mr Dam's point was
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
right ex dogs so he wants to make sure
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
that those dogs are not muzzled
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
right and Stacy want to make sure the
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
dogs aren't mule Stacy wants to make
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
sure that dogs aren't muzzled because of
 
01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
their breed right uh which are both
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable concerns right uh so um but
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we've said here that
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
okay then it says if it's also a dog is
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
considered to be a nuisance a menace or
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
vicious if it barks for sustained
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
periods of more than a half hour or
 
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
during the night or so is to disturb the
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
peace and quiet of a neighborhood or
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
area not including a dog which is
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
guarding working hering livestock is
 
01:36:59.870 --> 01:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 21 colon 34 A2 A4 it's
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
also considered a nuisance am Menace or

in such a manner that she will not come
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%

owner or
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
keeper it's also a nuisance if it runs
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
after chases bicycles Motor Vehicles
 
01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
motorcycles or other vehicles being
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
driven pulled or pushed on the Street
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
Highway or public way not supposed to be
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
loose to do also it's considered a
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
nuisance Menace or vicious if whether uh
 
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
alone or in a pack with other dogs it
 
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
bites attacks or preise on game animals
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
domestic animals foul or human human
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
beings so clearly the animals in
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
question that we're talking about are um
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
there are various descriptions here of
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a dog that's Menace a
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
nuisance or vicious quite complete I
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
would say quite complete I don't think
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's anything that needs to be
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
changed there um then it says in this
 
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
Statute in
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
2A if the skin of a person has been
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
punctured by a dog and the incident was
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
reported including the identity of the
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
dog and its owner to the animal officer
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
if any or to the town clerk such officer
 
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
or clerk shall within 24 hours notify
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
the injured person or in the case of a
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
minor the Minor's parent or Guardian
 
01:39:17.229 --> 01:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
whether according to town records the
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
dog has been appropriately immunized
 
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
against rabies so there's that thing is
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
within with an instance of an attack or
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
dog bite that U the person who was
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
bitten has to be contacted to let them
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
know whether that happen in the leblan
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
case I don't know we didn't hear I
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
probably I would imagine I'd have to go
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
back and listen if and it says if any
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
any person who fails by appropriate
 
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
action including but not limited to
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
restraining an animal from running at
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
large or otherwise effectively abating a
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
nuisance found such the provisions of
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
this section or who fails to comply with
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
any other provisions of this section
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
after being so ordered shall have the
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
person's dog taken into custody by the
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
police of the city Constable of the town
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
or other person authorized by the town
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
and such disposition made of the dog as
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
the court May
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
order so I
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
wonder what's the problem here that
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve that
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
isn't uh vested in that stat well what
 
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
they're trying trying to say is that the
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
um you're not able to um want that dog
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
muzzled when it when it's on a leash in
 
01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:35.790 align:start position:0%
muzzled when it when it's on a leash in
public

01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing in there that says
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
that you can Muzzle you can demand that
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
that dog be muzzled if it's in a crowd
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
of people or if it's around other dogs
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
or like that it hasn't bitten right so
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
issue is has to do with local control
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
versus State Control okay and the
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
attorney the City attorney for
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
Keen thought that the fact that there
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
that musling exists as a practice in
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
state law indicated that that's
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
something that community that localities
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have the power to do themselves
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't um I am
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
slightly dubious about that reading
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
however a trained lawyer I I also think
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
a trained lawyer probably is has more
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
experience in terms of reading the the
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
potential pitfalls of uh doing city
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
ordinances that might conflict with
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
state law than I do so I'm not gonna I'm
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
not GNA argue that right uh so um I
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
think what the solution here might be is
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
if we look at the
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
bill uh it's quite short it's pretty
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
short which is a nice thing yes um so
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
um the local governing body may take
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
such additional bylaw make such
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
additional bylaws and regulations
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
concerning the licensing muzzling and
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
restraining of dogs as it seems
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable that has been deemed to be
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
overly broad the musling so one thing we
 
01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
could do
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
is um put in another sentence saying
 
01:42:29.229 --> 01:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
that um the local governing body may
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
make additional
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
bylaws uh concerning dogs that are
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
deemed a nuisance or vicious under the
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
statute the Jud just went over what and
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and uh including and then uh in
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
including requiring musling requiring
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
there there's a whole list of things in
 
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
what um was quite comprehensive I
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
thought that that
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
um that Stacy sent us and uh we could
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
include you know a certain number of
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
those as you know possible things that
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
the uh that the community could make
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
laws about so um leash
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
muzzle um
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
confinement uh indoor confinement signs
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
liability insurance identifi
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
identification photographs microchips
 
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
spaying neutering I think that we I
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
probably don't I don't think spaying
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
neutering makes should belong on the
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
list let's let's first look at what what
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
are the the
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
penalties uh in in 466 colon 31 hyphen a
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
talks about the penalties about um if if
 
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
a a a dog is
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
um is a problem right but I think that
 
01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
what's what the town was looking for
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't so much a way of punishing
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
because they did they did they did love
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
you fine that's not that's not
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to solve the problem
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
the what what would solve the problem in
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
this particular case is if the dog had
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
been muzzled right um and so there are
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
and but but I think though and I don't
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
mean to interrupt you but I think though
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
if the person is fine and then no no
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
action is taken after that then it's
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
when the municipality can then say okay
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
well you're you a fine didn't work you
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
need to muzzle your
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
dog or you could say another possibility
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
is that there are a set of interventions
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
that can that can happen before the F
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
before a fine is levied so I mean
 
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
frankly if I were you know if I were in
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
the situation where you know my dog was
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
deemed I I wouldn't be in the situation
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
but if I were in a situation where my
 
01:45:04.109 --> 01:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
dog was deemed to be unsafe to travel
 
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
the you know travel on the street uh
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
without some further you know
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
safeguards I would much rather say have
 
01:45:14.589 --> 01:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
someone say if you're G to have your dog
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
outside it's got to be muzzled then you
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
need to pay the city 200
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
bucks so I I so I I think that uh
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
allowing this so allowing the city to
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
have certain behavioral options that uh
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and this would this would all be in
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
city by why we we don't need to do it at
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
the state level but allowing in state
 
01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
law for cities to to uh require certain
 
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
interventions is that what your language
 
01:45:49.589 --> 01:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
that you just gave us yes so the so the
 
01:45:51.629 --> 01:45:51.639 align:start position:0%
so the Lang and I haven't written down
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
the language or anything but spinning
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
off my top of the head the the you know
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the case of a dog deemed a nuisance
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
or vicious under what the statute
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the you know a city may have ordin
 
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.950 align:start position:0%
um uh the you know a city may have ordin
ordinances

01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
requiring uh musling leashing okay
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
microchipping and the other thing I
 
01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:20.679 align:start position:0%
don't know um how we you know could put
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
it in there but um if you have a younger
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
person or a slight buil person um trying
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
to control one of these vicious dogs
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
they they can't hold on to them
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes so having a muzzle on them
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
would really help if if something
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
happened I have been in a situation
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
where someone could not control their
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
dog and it dragged them across the
 
01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
parking lot and if the dog had and she
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
was so small that she should never have
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
been trying to hang on to a dog dog like
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah so that's where I think
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
muzzling would really and before before
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
they attack I know that's the problem
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that's they have to they have to
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
bite somebody once first but well I
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
think there were other things that that
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
that um would qualify it as being
 
01:47:15.149 --> 01:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
vicious or nuisance before it bit
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
someone like chasing bicycles I I in my
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
time of bicycling I have I have had some
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
scary experiences with being chased down
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
by a a pack of
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
dogs I once dog sat for a springer
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
spaniel who'd not been trained I could
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
not walk that dog and I'm not that small
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
or weak but he was so strong and he
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to follow a
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
lead yeah so so I would just suggest
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that in terms of we say something like
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
we take out this musling thing whatever
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
or we can just just even replace the
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
whole bill um that what in 466 colon 39
 
01:48:02.669 --> 01:48:02.679 align:start position:0%
City or bylaws we can add a uh take the
 
01:48:04.990 --> 01:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
musling thing out but add a sentence at
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
the end of that that says if a dog is
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
deemed vicious or a nuisance as defined
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
by RSA 466 col 31 the local governing
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
body May adopt ordinances as it deems
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable um okay um so I would
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
slightly change that so I or is that too
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
broad no it it's just kind of reversed
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
so the S because that's that makes it
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
sound like the ordinance is in response
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
to a particular dog which is not what
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do it's it's so the the
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
city or the municipality May adopt
 
01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances uh for the control or
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
restraint or restraint I like restraint
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
man management for the management of
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
right of dogs deemed vicious or nuisance
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
under RSA citation y so the governing
 
01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.790 align:start position:0%
under RSA citation y so the governing
body

01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:11.870 align:start position:0%
body
May

01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
May
 
01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.669 align:start position:0%
May
adopt

01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.119 --> 01:49:36.709 align:start position:0%
 
management

01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
of dogs
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
deemed um
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
menacing vicious or
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.189 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
a we've got adjectives and verbs so what
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
is it the local governing body May adopt
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances as it deems reasonable for
 
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
management of dogs deemed vicious as
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
too

01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but does it say musling is is that
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
included so that no this just this just
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
describes Menace n Menace nuisance and
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to refer back to to write
 
01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.109 align:start position:0%
it's going to refer back to to write
thein

01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
thein
 
01:50:55.709 --> 01:50:55.719 align:start position:0%
um so musling would be considered would
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
be a management practice so this also
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
said this also means that if you've got
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
a dog that's barking over a half hour
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
over a half hour in the middle of the
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
night the the municipality can make
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances to deal with that right yeah
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
now are the people is jod new and the
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
people that are supporting the musling
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
thing going to be content with this is
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
this answer well this I think is a lot
 
01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
broader than this
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
they wanted they basically wanted
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
something to
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
Da uh that would give ke the ability to
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
pass an ordinance that would deal with
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
situation right yeah I like putting it
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
back on the municipality to determine
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
the wording of what they need yeah what
 
01:51:40.589 --> 01:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
they think is reasonable I like that
 
01:51:40.599 --> 01:51:41.870 align:start position:0%
they think is reasonable I like that
phrase

01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
too well I wonder if 466 colon 39 the
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
city or town bylaws if we can write
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
rewrite that
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
whole paragraph because it says the
 
01:51:55.069 --> 01:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
local governing body may make such
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
additional bylaws and regulations
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
concerning the licensing musling and
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
restraining of dogs as it deems
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable and may affix penalties not
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
exceeding $50 for a breach thereof such
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
bylaws and regulations shall relate only
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
to dogs owned and kept in such a city or
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
town and the annual fee required for a
 
01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
license shall in no case be more than a
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
dollar in addition to the sum hereby
 
01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:21.149 align:start position:0%
dollar in addition to the sum hereby
required

01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
so I think if we're saying the local
 
01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
governing body May adopt ordinances as
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
it deems reasonable for management of
 
01:52:32.589 --> 01:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
dogs deemed vicious a menace a nuisance
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
or vicious as defined by RSA 466 colon
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
31 that kind of
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
replaces yes I think so the first
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
um well we don't want to say both the
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
local governing body may make such
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
additional bylaws and also say the
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
municipality May adopt ordinances I mean
 
01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
isn't that redundant oh yeah that's yeah
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
make laws and regulations would be the
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
same as ordinances ordinances y so I oh
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
so oh but you're you're thinking that
 
01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:24.149 align:start position:0%
so oh but you're you're thinking that
restraining

01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
restraining
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay but but there may be a
 
01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:27.950 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay but but there may be a
question

01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:31.639 align:start position:0%
so you might there there are some there
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
are some reasonable ways there are some
 
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
situations where it would be reasonable
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
to require the Restraint of a dog when
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
the dog has not been deemed to be so you
 
01:53:44.069 --> 01:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to take that away from so you
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
don't want you want you don't want to
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
say that that the city can't make
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
a a leash law right um because and you
 
01:53:54.719 --> 01:53:55.709 align:start position:0%
a a leash law right um because and you
know

01:53:55.709 --> 01:53:55.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
and and that you know in you know that
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
there are certain areas that you would
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
be required to have your dog have a dog
 
01:54:07.069 --> 01:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
on a leash whether or not it is you know
 
01:54:07.079 --> 01:54:08.550 align:start position:0%
on a leash whether or not it is you know
considered

01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
problematic um so so you can leave the
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
restraint in so I think the restraining
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be there and then the the
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
management of vicious dogs is on top of
 
01:54:21.599 --> 01:54:22.950 align:start position:0%
management of vicious dogs is on top of
that

01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:25.709 --> 01:54:25.719 align:start position:0%
and does the penalty piece work for
 
01:54:25.719 --> 01:54:28.550 align:start position:0%
and does the penalty piece work for
people

01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I have no idea how much you charge
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
for these
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
things well there's a different set of
 
01:54:35.079 --> 01:54:37.550 align:start position:0%
things well there's a different set of
penalties

01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
for under the the vicious dog right
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
thing right yes it's it's a whole
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph of
 
01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.390 align:start position:0%
paragraph of
them

01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so my my thing
 
01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
though just aside from this my thing
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
though is I just don't want to have a
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
situation where you have somebody in
 
01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
town who has a dog the select board
 
01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:05.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't like this guy and they're gonna
 
01:55:08.189 --> 01:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
make some kind of ordinance targeting
 
01:55:08.199 --> 01:55:09.470 align:start position:0%
make some kind of ordinance targeting
this

01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
guy or you know
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
make do something that's going to you
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
know get after him for dog they don't
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
like something else about his property
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm kind of like leaning
 
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.030 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm kind of like leaning
towards

01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
words they can't just say that they want
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
to muzzle an animal they have to have a
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
cause for doing that there has to be and
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
I think in here where it says you know
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
what um if it's running after somebody
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
who's on a bicycle if it's uh uh if it
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
bites somebody there has to be some sort
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
of yeah so so well the the restraint so
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
the the existing language in terms of
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
restraint can be I I and that's been
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
there for a long time yeah and it's
 
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:57.320 align:start position:0%
broad enough to let them it's broad
 
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
enough that and my sense is that
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
basically has largely has to do with
 
01:56:06.270 --> 01:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
leash laws yeah um and is that a cityby
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
city thing that's a city by City thing
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't even know that I think there
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
might I don't know there might be a I'm
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
not sure if there's a Statewide lee law
 
01:56:18.189 --> 01:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
too I don't um doesn't matter for our
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
purposes today um but I I don't think we
 
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
should mess with the existing thing
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
about licensing and restraining I think
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
we just need to add language saying that
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
specifically for vicious dogs well why
 
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
don't we say mus in in this I got here
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
how about this the local governing body
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
may make such additional bylaws and
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
regulations concerning the licing
 
01:56:40.719 --> 01:56:42.030 align:start position:0%
regulations concerning the licing
licensing

01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
musling of vicious dogs as as described
 
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
46631 and restraining of dogs as it
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
deems reasonable
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay that way we're we're putting the
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
reason for muzzling the dogs in the
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
nuisance slot okay sure um that that's I
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
is that's simple enough I this that will
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
deal with this particular situation and
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
um right I I guess that
 
01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
what what Stacy had been sort of
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
indicating was that there are a number
 
01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
of different mechanisms for managing
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
dogs that are are problematic and you
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
might not necessarily want to limit
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
yourself to saying that it should be
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
muzzled that in some cases you know
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
there might be other management
 
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
practices well you want to just say
 
01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
instead of musling management of vicious
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
dogs as describ
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
as as um defined
 
01:57:47.079 --> 01:57:49.790 align:start position:0%
as as um defined
in

01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
RSA do you lose something by taking
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
um well I'm I just I I'm kind of up two
 
01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.109 --> 01:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
raising when when it turn when just in
 
01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.990 align:start position:0%
raising when when it turn when just in
terms

01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
of I think I think CH putting Management
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
in in that way creates an IG a language
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
ambiguity because
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's it might
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
it so there is nothing in
 
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
466 uh whatever it is 31 4
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
31 that talks
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
about uh specifically about musling but
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
there are implications in that chapter
 
01:58:42.119 --> 01:58:43.270 align:start position:0%
there are implications in that chapter
about

01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.870 align:start position:0%
about
management

01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so I'm thinking
 
01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
that that could be read by someone who
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
didn't know our intent as the management
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
has to be something that's in
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
46631 oh I hear what you're saying so I
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
think I think it's if we're going to go
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
with that more limited phrasing that
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting which I don't think I
 
01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
think is is reasonable then we need to
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
musling and I didn't understand and the
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill is about musling the Bill's about
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
musling and I don't think so I I think
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's not crazy for us to just focus on
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know use use musling and I think we
 
01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
have if someone comes back with another
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
bill at some point right that where they
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
want to you know revise the entire
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
how um unruly dogs are dealt with then
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with it again that in the
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
future but I think this I think I'm I'm
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
now leaning towards making this just as
 
01:59:49.709 --> 01:59:49.719 align:start position:0%
small as we need to make it okay yeah I
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to see that one um man that
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh had hunting dogs if they run off his
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
property to cross the road chasing a
 
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
rabbit or whatever they're doing I don't
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
want to have him call and force him to
 
02:00:07.629 --> 02:00:07.639 align:start position:0%
musle well that's why we need this
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
definition linked to this right to this
 
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
RSA there there is a there is a the
 
02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:18.109 align:start position:0%
RSA there there is a there is a the
46631

02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
46631
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
does exclud does exclude
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so that um yeah
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that works for
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
me so we want to say musling
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the local governing body may make
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
such additional bylaws and regulations
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
concerning the
 
02:00:43.229 --> 02:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
licensing musling of vicious dogs as
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
46631 and restraining of dogs as it seem
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
as it deems reasonable yeah right yeah
 
02:00:51.599 --> 02:00:52.550 align:start position:0%
as it deems reasonable yeah right yeah
yep

02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
yep
