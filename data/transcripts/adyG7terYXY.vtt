thank you we're going to open up the

relative to aftermarket window tinting
 
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
on Motor Vehicles for drivers with
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
medical conditions
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative yokaila
 
00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor good morning sir
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
good morning uh for the record my name
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
is representative yokella uh from
 
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 Fremont Danville and
 
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.249 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 Fremont Danville and
Brentwood

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
um I am introducing HB 730
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
um because uh the story really starts a
 
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
few years ago in 2021
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
um when I put in a bill to
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
um increase or allow side window tinting
 
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
on on
 
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles
 
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 align:start position:0%
and the amendment to that bill in 2021
 
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
removed the exemption for
 
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh so the the bill was amended by this
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
committee and in that Amendment the
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
exemption for uh side window tinting was
 
00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.050 align:start position:0%
exemption for uh side window tinting was
removed

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.950 align:start position:0%
removed
um

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
for medical waivers there is no more
 
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
medical waivers for side window tinting
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
um in our statute and
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
was an unfortunate I don't think it was
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
intended there was no testimony saying
 
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.170 align:start position:0%
intended there was no testimony saying
that

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 align:start position:0%
anything has changed as far as medical
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
necessity for for side window tinting
 
00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.350 align:start position:0%
necessity for for side window tinting
and

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.689 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
I also know that last year there was a
 
00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:44.570 align:start position:0%
I also know that last year there was a
bill

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
um that that was kind of stemmed from
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
this uh lack of side window tinting
 
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.330 align:start position:0%
this uh lack of side window tinting
um

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
uh medical waiver that adjusted the
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
windshield uh medical waiver aspect and
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
there once again was little Fanfare and
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
no discussion about whether or not it
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to have the window
 
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
tinting for the medical waivers and if
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
medical waivers were of value right now
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
the only medical waiver allowed is for
 
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
70 which is on windshield and
 
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.610 align:start position:0%
70 which is on windshield and
um

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
and that erosion of these medical
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
waivers has essentially
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
um it's come back and many people have
 
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
reached out to me and said you know I I
 
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
have had a medical waiver and my car
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
tinted for many years and now I'm no
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
longer able to have the the window
 
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.710 align:start position:0%
longer able to have the the window
tinting

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
tinting
 
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419 align:start position:0%
um because it's just not allowed under
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
our current law and
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I believe that this was an unintended
 
00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 align:start position:0%
consequence and so what I'm trying to do
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
with this bill is to remedy that by
 
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
putting back in the language of 6658
 
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
Dash a uh Roman 3 Dash a
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
um that you are allowed to have an
 
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.990 align:start position:0%
um that you are allowed to have an
exemption

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
for Windows of the left and right side
 
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
of the driver and
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm also
 
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.070 align:start position:0%
um I'm also
uh

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:29.660 align:start position:0%
kind of changing the the um the the
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
process for getting that and right now
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
you're you have to request it from the
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner and they may or may not
 
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
have granted depending on
 
00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:40.690 align:start position:0%
have granted depending on
um

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:40.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
essentially what they see is is
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
if it qualifies based on
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's an unknown whatever is whatever the
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
the uh requirements or or status that
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're going by even though your doctor
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
May say that it's required and so what
 
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
I'm saying what I am proposing in this
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill is that the um
 
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.070 align:start position:0%
bill is that the um
um

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
that you're a partic a practitioner that
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
you have a relationship with can just
 
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
attest that
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
um your you have medical conditions
 
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
um which window tinting would reduce the
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
severity of or would
 
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
severity of or would
um

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
um yes so you've been diagnosed or take
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
medications that cause a condition which
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
tinted windows would reduce the severity
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
of and then
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
um from the commissioner's span
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
standpoint they're just going to trust
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
the doctor unless they believe that the
 
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
doctor may be acting in bad faith and
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
then they might
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
um uh Ford those those letters on to
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
their regulating agency if they're if
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
the doctor is doing something suspicious
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
and instead of right now they have like
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
a power to convene a whole kind of
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee as far to decide whether or
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
not it's appropriate and um and I think
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
that's if the doctor says you know we
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't question if the doctor writes a
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
prescription for
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
for uh you know Xanax or whatever we
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't ask that whether or not that's
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate unless it's egregious and
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
then we would go to the medical go go to
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
their regulatory agency and and say hey
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
this is this person is acting in bad
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
faith I think that should be the same
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know uh process essentially for for
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
this medical tinting so I'm happy to
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I've got a couple quick ones
 
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
so you're fine with the current statute
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
the way it reads in regards to the
 
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.269 align:start position:0%
the way it reads in regards to the
windshields

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
windshields
 
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
because this just refers to the side
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
I I am I am uh saying that it's going
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
back to 30 so on line 24 to 25 I'm
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
um if the doctor
 
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.069 align:start position:0%
um if the doctor
um

00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
the doctor allows the 35 percent
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
if they say that you need tinting then
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
you can go up to the 35 just like you
 
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.329 align:start position:0%
you can go up to the 35 just like you
were

00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
um in the previous you know
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
decades before last year
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
or in in 2021 so yeah it essentially
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
reverts to the same practice for medical
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
waivers that we had in 2021 and before
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
okay would allow up to 35 on the on the
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
windshield as well with the waiver uh
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
one other quick question for you I got
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
an email from I believe it was an
 
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019 align:start position:0%
optometrist uh who had no issues with
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
the bill the way it was what it was
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
attempting but mentioned that
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
photophobia might be a little bit too
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
General a term
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.769 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:05.050 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
so so I actually reached out to my so
 
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
one of the things that previously was an
 
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
issue is that you only
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
um it was construed the language was
 
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
construed to only allow doctors to say
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
that you um need medical tinting but if
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
you may be seeing uh you know uh uh
 
00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:30.019 align:start position:0%
primary care provider that is uh uh
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
registered nurse or some other
 
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.069 align:start position:0%
registered nurse or some other
um

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
other doctor that may not be actually of
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
an MD and so I I pretty much widen this
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
to saying any medical practitioner that
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
has a relationship with the patient and
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
So currently I talked to my eye doctor
 
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
they wanted that language change because
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
they would be able to then do this which
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
they weren't
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
previously allowed to and they um I had
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
my eye doctor look at all of these
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
um these uh actually he was the one
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
suggested them to me for the most part
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
but then um they uh
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
striking any language since it says my
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
but not limited to it if you wanna if
 
00:13:22.329 --> 00:13:22.339 align:start position:0%
you feel like you want to strike
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
photophobia I don't have a problem
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
because it's technically not limited to
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
photophobia if the doctor if the
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
practitioner believes that the phobia
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
photophobia meets the statement that
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
they have to sign then it would still be
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
allowed even though it's not
 
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
specifically delimited in the list
 
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I actually have two
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
or three questions uh but I'll ask one
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
at a time
 
00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:53.210 align:start position:0%
at a time
um

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
the first part is on that line uh 24.
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make sure I understand it
 
00:13:57.959 --> 00:13:59.210 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make sure I understand it
correctly

00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
does this mean you can tint the windows
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
up to 65 percent
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes the the when you say light
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
transmittance then you're talking about
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
how much light is actually going through
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.889 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
uh

00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
what happens when if a police officer
 
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
well it's probably maybe for another
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
person but have you thought about it but
 
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
police officer pulled someone over
 
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's driving that person's car
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the condition I mean
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
are they going to have a medical card on
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.210 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
question

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so there is as you see online
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
um 15 to 16 the the commissioner
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
actually issues a special permit and
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
um there and the conditions for the
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
officer I'm just changing the conditions
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
to the same conditions they were in 2021
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
so it's no more dangerous or or or
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
um or harmful to any officer or they
 
00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:21.899 align:start position:0%
need any less training also New
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and the other states
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
around it also have tinting not for
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
medical reasons for um down to this
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
level and so they're traveling into New
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and police officers are
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
already still having to deal with that
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
issue whether or not this is we're
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
allowing you know people with medical
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
conditions to to be able to utilize this
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
technically because we've had this
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
conversation before you are correct in
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
your suspicion
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
that somebody without the medical
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
condition themselves is not supposed to
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
be driving the car with the tent that's
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
accepted so one more follow-up
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr last one uh is there
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
is there an issue why why can't uh these
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
people I know my my mother had
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to light but and she wore
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
sunglasses why can't that continue
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe that I sh
 
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.610 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe that I sh
um

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:24.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
that sunglasses treat every condition
 
00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:31.139 align:start position:0%
listed and
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that they would be
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate in every situation and I'm
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
not I'm not really uh
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
here I guess with the intent to resell
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
you on the the con the state of the law
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
that it was two years ago it it was the
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
law and we didn't have really any
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that that it needed to change
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe that it was an
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
unintentional change and not like
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
something that went through rigorous
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
process that we needed to you know you
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
know medical weight people coming and
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
saying this was no longer needed and we
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
should reduce it that was not
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
um my understanding of the testimony and
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
so I believe that it was an unintended
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
and not
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to to say that I'm the you
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
know Medical Professional that said that
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
this is the best solution
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
see you then thank you very much thank
 
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:37.370 align:start position:0%
see you then thank you very much thank
you

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Lieutenant O'Leary from
 
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
 
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.789 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
chairman

00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I just wanted
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
to speak briefly on part of this so the
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
medical waiver going back to the way
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
that it was previously we have no issue
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
with this has been back and forth as we
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
know we're good with the way that that
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
part's written my only concern and it's
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh only because I'm not sure what this
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
new process would look like
 
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:18.419 align:start position:0%
um excuse me lines 25 and 26 that speak
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner forwarding any sworn
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
statements to licensing agency for the
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
practitioner to review suspicious waiver
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
submission so the way that the way that
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
it works currently in the law
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is allowed to seek the
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
advice of the medical Review Board in
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
order to determine if a person you know
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
is eligible for such a waiver
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
this would this new wording would remove
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
that ability and rely solely on the
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
licensing agency to then review it
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
the process works right now with an
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
application the application being made
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
to the DMV if there's fraudulent
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
information on that application or if
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's attempting to obtain one of
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
these waivers fraudulently the
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
application process allows for denial
 
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
allows for the petitioner for a hearing
 
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
it allows for state police to involve be
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
involved in a criminal investigation
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way the process currently
 
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
Works my concern with the new wording it
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
would remove that and rely solely on a
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
letter from a doctor and now widening up
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
the the people that could provide that
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
and I understand the concerns on adding
 
00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:28.820 align:start position:0%
the optometrists and the
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists and totally understand
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
all that part of it but the addition of
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
any other medical practitioner then
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
opens up the door to my podiatrist
 
00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:39.299 align:start position:0%
writing a letter for me and now without
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner having the ability to
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
seek the advice of a medical board
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's not a process in place
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
essentially to protect the DMV in that
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
area so for those reasons I would ask
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
that you just consider that part of it
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
however we do support the 35 percent on
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
the medical waiver
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to take any questions
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative Sykes
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
the language in the proposed bill says
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner shall
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
issue a medical waiver is that the same
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
language as the old version
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that preempts any
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
possibility to
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
take a look at each individual statement
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
as it arrives on his desk his or her
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
desk thank you Mr representative Sykes
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
yes it currently says that the
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner May waive the requirements
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
so they have the ability he does have
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%

industry
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to start out by saying that for
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
the inspection industry the window tint
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
laws are about as clear as 35 light
 
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.550 align:start position:0%
laws are about as clear as 35 light
transmittance

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
transmittance
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill as it has presented uh is
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
questionable as to whether the sponsors
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
have done their due diligence and
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
research the industry standards at this
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
point such as the FM VSS standard number
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
205 relating to Federal window 10 and
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
talked about Indus or failed to talk
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
with industry participants to truly
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
understand what is being proposed
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
the FM VSS standard number 205 relating
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
to window 10 already requires a 70 light
 
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.870 align:start position:0%
to window 10 already requires a 70 light
transmittance

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
transmittance
 
00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:53.060 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know how the sponsor
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
proposes getting new vehicle
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to adopt 90 light
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
transmittance only on vehicles sold in
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so they will pass our
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
inspection standards
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
does the sponsor understand that if this
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
bill passes as written it will cost the
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
average motorist a minimum of a thousand
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
or more dollars to retrofit their
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
existing vehicles to comply with a 90
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
light transmittance
 
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
does a sponsor realize at this point
 
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:22.700 align:start position:0%
that every vehicle knew or used
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
currently being sold in the state of New
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would not pass inspection if
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
the bill is passed as written
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
I want you to a lot you know consider
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
that allowing front windshield tint may
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
also provide prevent a vehicle operator
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
from being able to see sufficiently at
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
night allowing a 35 percent light
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
transmittance is like wearing your
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
darkest sunglasses at night so how is
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
that going to enable somebody with
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
already compromised vision
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
as I said can you know can you possibly
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
see with 35 percent tint on your
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
windshield that pedestrian and dark
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
clothing walking down the road
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
if you're in the North country are you
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
going to be able to see that moose
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
crossing the road walking down the road
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
with 35 percent tint on your windshield
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
and again 90 light transmittance makes
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
every vehicle on the road today and that
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
you drove in in violation of a state
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
inspection standard
 
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee one
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.810 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
um just so we're clear what what is the
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
light transmittance now for new vehicles
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
that are sold in New Hampshire
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
it is currently 70 percent
 
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
and that is a federal standard so it's
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
30 and follow up thank you so that means
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
that it's 30 percent is allowed to be
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
locked or is it automatically coming in
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
that way it's automatically coming in
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
that way okay so just for reference if
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
you look out the window behind you that
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
is 30 light transmittance
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you one quick last one
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's is that done by film or is that
 
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.109 align:start position:0%
that's is that done by film or is that
done

00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
um and is there any blockage for UVA UVB
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
with any of that um light transference
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
so this is built into the glass that is
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
currently in the cars now so what will
 
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
you consider clear glass on any given
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
car right now is actually measured at 30
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
percent light transmit with UV blocking
 
00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:35.579 align:start position:0%
built in it is built thank you very much
 
00:38:37.329 --> 00:38:37.339 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to make
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
clear he's he's not mentioning in this
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
in this uh Bill uh 537 anything about 65
 
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
flight blockage just so you're aware
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
right all right so he's saying 90.
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
you're saying it automatically comes in
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
at 70. automatically I didn't even do
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering if he's saying can
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
we add 10 more
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
so and this is part of the confusion
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
that industry struggles with if we say
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
90 light transmittance it's actually
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
reverses 10 blockage of light sunlight
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
trans metal so I think what he was
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get at was he wants to go as
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
dark as you know 10 transmittance which
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
is lower than the 35 standard we already
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
have adopted for window 10.
 
00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:32.099 align:start position:0%
so if you can imagine ninety percent of
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
the light being blocked
 
00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:35.579 align:start position:0%
as I think where he was trying to go
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
with this but again that's darker than
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative Coker so just to clarify
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
on this thank you for taking the
 
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.770 align:start position:0%
on this thank you for taking the
question

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
basically the way that this just so I
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand it this Bill is
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
saying anything that has less than 90
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
percent visible light transmit that
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
right now we can go the it's it's legal
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
to go to 35 basically or it's yeah so
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
what they're they're at 90 you're
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
lessening what's already out there now
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
so we currently have an industry
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
standard set by the feds of 70 percent
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
so he wants to take that the way this is
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
written and presented and make it 90 we
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
would be the only state in the country
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
requiring 90 in our glass okay so this
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
is actually restricting it further right
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's not confusing but
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
can you show me where it talks about the
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
factory Windows following uh Nitsa codes
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
because everything I read in here talks
 
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
about aftermarket tinting sure so in the
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety standard
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
number 205 and I have a
 
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
piece of it here
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
it talks about glazing and materials uh
 
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
standard number 205 requires 70 light
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
transmittance in all windows and
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles multi-purpose
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles motorhomes and trucks
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
are required to have 70 light transmits
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the windows and windshield and
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
windows to the immediate right and left
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'm still missing where it singles
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
that out but one last question for me
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
Isn't 90 percent light transmittance uh
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
more than 70 percent it is correct thank
 
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.630 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
committee

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jones
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm actually kind
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
of following up on your questions sir
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
not the aftermarket but the factory like
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
I have Factory tinting on my car
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and to tell you the truth I don't
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
know what it is but but
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
there's a darker shade on the top and it
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
gets lighter as it goes down
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
what what is the standard for that is it
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
so what you're talking about is on your
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
windshield you have the blue shading on
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
the top if you will or or correct sir
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
tan shading and then it gets down to
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
what we consider clear glass below it
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
exactly right which is fully accepted in
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
the current law says that you can have
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
up to six inches of the top of the
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
windshield tinted to 35 35 thank you
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
um I I have to admit I've never I've
 
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
understood all these the way all this is
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
explained uh percentage-wise I just
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
would like to know if this bill was to
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
pass and I'm I'm facing in traffic
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
a car that has this if this bill passed
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
what would I see looking into that car
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
when I see the driver would I see
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
anything well yeah so and this is where
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
the confusion comes in so the way it's
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
this bill is currently written it's
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
changing the standard from 70 light
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
Transmissions which if you really look
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
at it is is almost clear glass to a
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
lesser standard of 90 which is
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
you take away the UV blockage UV
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
protection and stuff like that that's
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
built into the glass so our standard
 
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
what you would consider clear glass
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
actually blocks about 30 percent of the
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
light coming into it
 
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.290 align:start position:0%
light coming into it
yep

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
but my question is would I be able to
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
see the driver in that vehicle facing if
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
this bill passed yes at 90 yes you would
 
00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
be able to see it if it was written the
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
way I believe it was intended to say 10
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
light transmittance then no you wouldn't
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
see the driver
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
well I don't know if that's how it was
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be written um any other
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
I'm still very confused because and I
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us are here now because
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
you said the very top six inches is 35
 
00:44:02.089 --> 00:44:02.099 align:start position:0%
yep right
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
but then you say in the windshield's
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
already at 30 correct Factory out of the
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
factory so I just never seen that before
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
but so
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
that 35 on the top that's an additional
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
tinting to the 30 right but you can have
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
a you can only have a maximum so if you
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
have currently have 30 from the factory
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
you could only add a five percent tint
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
to maximize that 35.
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
on top of it
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
this is one of those examples you
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
haven't lived until you've dealt with a
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
window tinting building
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
because it gets confusing between
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
transmittance and emittance so right uh
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
do you have any written testimony
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes Lieutenant O'Leary
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety opposed to
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr chair could you
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
ask for written testimony
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
um could you provide the committee with
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
some written testimony
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
you ready to make it even more
 
00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:12.770 align:start position:0%
you ready to make it even more
convoluted

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
convoluted
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
I'm actually just going to try to
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit more for you so
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'll give it my best shot I did bring
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
some examples uh because that's how I
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
work here so when we talk about the
 
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
standard of light trans minutes it's the
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
amount the percentage of light that's
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
allowed to come through the window so
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
this example that I'll pass around so
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
you could get a better glimpse of it if
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're good with that this example which
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
is almost clear is 28 per I'm sorry yeah
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
let me start off wrong this one right
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
here is 78 percent
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
so your car windshield is around this
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
Clarity it allows approximately 70 to 78
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
light through kind of like this right
 
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
this next one that I'll pass around is
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
28 so when you think of your 35 percent
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
tint uh the medical waiver we talked
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
about just prior to this bill it's
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
darker than this this is 28 light
 
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:11.329 align:start position:0%
darker than this this is 28 light
transmitter

00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.339 --> 00:46:13.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
um representative Jones to answer your
 
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
question earlier that top Sun strip is
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
third is you know approximately 35
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
percent with the remainder of your
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
windshield would be 70 so the only
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
reason why we really oppose this bill is
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
because it's it's asking to make the
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
windshield lighter than what it
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
currently Is So currently with the
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
pigments and everything that are inside
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
when that when that windshield is
 
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
manufactured it's at 70 percent if you
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
pass this law it'll be required that
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's lighter than that it would be 90
 
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.290 align:start position:0%
it's lighter than that it would be 90
percent

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
and this is very difficult to because we
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
for a number of years we always thought
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
the opposite way of the blockage this
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
sorry that I see that representative
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hill has a question that's all I had to
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.470 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
chairman

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
so if I if I understand your belief of
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
this bill it would require
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
the windshield to be removed if this
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
passes it would require the windshield
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be removed and replaced with the
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
windshield that allows clearer glass
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
than what we currently have yes sir yes
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
we we can debate that because I still
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
keep seeing aftermarket which is
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
different but and I know the argument we
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
used to have was for the older vehicles
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
that actually came clear so we were
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
looking at aftermarkets match the
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
federal standards right do you know of
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
any Vehicles now that come from the
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
factory uh lighter up with less
 
00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:52.550 align:start position:0%
factory uh lighter up with less
transmittance

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
transmittance
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
more transmittance than 70 percent
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
um I would have to say yes because uh
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that we tested this morning
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
so approximately 81 so it would be more
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
than the 70. but still lighter I'm sorry
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
yeah not darker then yeah correct so so
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
in your knowledge there are no vehicles
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
that come from the factory anymore with
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
completely clear with correct with 100
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay any other questions
 
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Fox
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair do you think that the
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill has been miswritten
 
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
and that I mean I I know we can't
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
speculate what the sponsor intended but
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking that the sponsor
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
intended it to be flipped and that 90
 
00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:46.670 align:start position:0%
intended it to be flipped and that 90
percent

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
should be blocked yeah thank you for
 
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
your question representative Fox
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I I can only speculate as you said
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
however that being the case and looking
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
the way that this was written and the
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
last part of it talks about being able
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
to apply for a medical waiver again like
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
we spoke about earlier so if that were
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
the case we were only allowing 10 light
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
transmitted then the medical waiver
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
would then make it lighter and they
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
would have a 35 light transmittance so
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
um to answer your question to
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
um it's been mentioned several times
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
about what the motives of the Prime
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
sponsor is I'm going to do something
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
unusual today he didn't reach out to me
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
when we're done with questions for the
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
lieutenant I'm going to recess this
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
hearing and give them an opportunity to
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
say what it is if I can fit it in our
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
schedule for the rest of the day
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
any other questions for lieutenant
 
00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:40.490 align:start position:0%
any other questions for lieutenant
O'Leary

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
O'Leary
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Coker thank you Mr
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um is there is is there any
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
distinction between aftermarket and
 
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
Factory right now in the current law
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
like is it or do those it doesn't matter
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
in what way sir so like can if if my
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
um if I bought a car that had the 20
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
restricted could I
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
add another 10 to 15 on that as long as
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go below the the federal
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
standard the aftermarket or okay so that
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
makes sense I'll try to I'll try to
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
answer a question sorry so
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
um we you cannot have 35 window tint
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
left right of the driver windshield
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
unless this other logos for free medical
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
waiver so you currently can have on the
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
windshield only what is uh at the time
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
of manufacture which we've determined is
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 and left and right of
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
the driver aftermarket meaning you can
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
apply a film to it up to uh 70 currently
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
is allowed then if your rear windows are
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
whatever they come through manufacturer
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
which oftentimes is 35 or less you'll
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
see like in the SUVs with the dark
 
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
Windows those are acceptable if they
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
come through clear you can't then use
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
aftermarket window tint to make it 35 so
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers the
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
question at all representative I uh
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the last part of that
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
again in terms of the real Windows yes
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
so if you have uh typically the way that
 
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
you would see this is uh with an SUV it
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
comes through already with manufactured
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
tinted windows if for some reason it was
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
not tinted you are not
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
um authorized to then apply aftermarket
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
window tint to make it dark like 35
 
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.410 align:start position:0%
window tint to make it dark like 35
percent

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
so we need another bill
 
00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.470 align:start position:0%
so we need another bill
okay

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions from the
 
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.470 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions from the
committee

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
well I only have these two examples sir
 
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.370 align:start position:0%
well I only have these two examples sir
so

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:27.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago I had one with four
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
down to 18 I believe did I see another
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
hand representative Jones
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
can I just ask you a question sometimes
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
my uh when I go to the optometrist to
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
order glasses
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh they'll offer you a tensed that says
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
they don't talk about the sun glare they
 
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:53.579 align:start position:0%
said it reduces nighttime Road glare
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
um I I wouldn't be qualified to answer
 
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
that question representative Jones
 
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.990 align:start position:0%
that question representative Jones
unfortunately

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's a unique idea though windshields
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
inside windows that actually darkened
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
and lit just like glasses yeah
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
um representative Hill
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the best part of having the side
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
windows tinted is the reflection off the
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
rear mirrors when someone's behind me
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
with high beams or whatever
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
would would this
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
help at all if if the tinting were
 
00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.770 align:start position:0%
help at all if if the tinting were
darker

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
darker
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
well I I'm kind of thinking this through
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
as I go here so um the window film
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
that's that's on the windshield now yes
 
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:51.950 align:start position:0%
that's that's on the windshield now yes
sir

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.089 align:start position:0%
sir
um

00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:53.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
do you are you qualified to know whether
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the film is what changes
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
the light that comes through the side
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
windows or is it the actual Tint that's
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
a good question uh representative so uh
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge the way that the
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
manufactured Windows uh include a
 
00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
pigment and a die so when they make the
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
glass they actually mix that in
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
and that's how you get your windows and
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
windshield tinted to the degree that
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
they are it only allows that allowed
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
amount of light transmittance when you
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
use the aftermarket window tint the film
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
it still allows for that same amount so
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the amount of light
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
transmittance it's just how it's applied
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
and we have a late arrival
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
uh not taking a position on the bill uh
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
director marasco from the Department of
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
committee John marasco director of The
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles and
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
registration supervisor Jeff obedank
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we uh we support everything that was
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
uh just testified to by Lieutenant
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
O'Leary in Industry obviously uh
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
replacing the windshield would not be
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
prudent in this case we just wanted to
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
give you perspective on what we see at
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
the DMV so in my 11 months there I can
 
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
tell you that window 10 I know we've
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
used the word confusing it is confusing
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
and not only that it generates a lot of
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
phone calls from elected officials who
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
are representing their constituents um
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
of anything ranging from inspection
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
stations removing tent for people who
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
had previously medical waivers to
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
questions to people just not
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
understanding window 10. so
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
um we just bring that to your attention
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
in the hopes that we've heard two bills
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
this morning on window 10 that maybe at
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
one point we could I don't know if a
 
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
study committee is is something that you
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
would want to take a look at but to
 
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
really come up with a good solid plan so
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
that something could be pushed out that
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
people actually understand and
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
they understand transmittance and what
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
that means the 70 30 and people actually
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
can follow the law
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
I thought you'd have another one I I
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
would also Echo those thoughts taking a
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
number of those complaints myself if the
 
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
language is confusing for us and we do
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
it every day I can imagine just how
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
confusing it is for the public when
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
they're deciding to put window tint on
 
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
one year and then being told they have
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
to take it off the next year and then
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
potentially change out a windshield a
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
third year in a row I mean we're looking
 
00:55:30.049 --> 00:55:30.059 align:start position:0%
at three years in a row of changing
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
window tint law and I think that's
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
creating as much confusion uh for us who
 
00:55:37.609 --> 00:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
have to manage the program for those who
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
are trying to figure out if they should
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
apply it to their vehicles
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you any questions from
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
the committee I think you've given me a
 
00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:48.049 align:start position:0%
the committee I think you've given me a
plan

00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I think the biggest confusion is the
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
is the uh What's blocking and what's
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
letting light through and and so I'm
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if there is a
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
um is there a standard that that is used
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
from state to state of does everyone do
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
all of the laws deal with the
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
transference or do they deal with um the
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
Restriction what
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
that may be part of it because I I've
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
run into people that come from different
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
parts of the country and say oh no we
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
have 70 and and come to find out they're
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
really talking about 30 when it comes to
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
our laws so is that part of the problem
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a great question
 
00:56:35.819 --> 00:56:36.710 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a great question
um

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
that answers whether or not we should
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
CNN thank you much thank you
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
I have nobody else signed up but as I
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
said I'm going to make the rare move of
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
recessing this and giving the prime
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor an opportunity if you can't make
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
it I'll close it later if I see it's
 
00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to disrupt our schedule I'll close
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
it later so I'm going to recess House
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
Bill the public hearing on House Bill
 
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:11.150 align:start position:0%
Bill the public hearing on House Bill
537.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
being 1032 I'm going to open up the

constituent who was unable to be here
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%

good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Bill
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
Lambert um State traffic engineer for
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
Transportation I submitted written
 
01:04:18.299 --> 01:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
Transportation I submitted written
testimony

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's in front of you I probably should
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
have kept a copy of it for myself but I
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
I can probably
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
um summarize a couple points and a
 
01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:29.339 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have a position on
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
the bill but a couple points to consider
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
one would be that
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note that was prepared for
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
this bill was prepared by the judicial
 
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.849 align:start position:0%
this bill was prepared by the judicial
branch

01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
branch
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
um presumably if you're going to have a
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
bill like this it's going to be
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
different from other states you would
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
have to have some signing to let people
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
know otherwise how would they know
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
there's a bill so the signing costs
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
would be indeterminate because we don't
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
know what what the limit would be
 
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.690 align:start position:0%
know what what the limit would be
um

01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:52.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
and again the bill that's passed in New
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you could teach everybody
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that the new new law we
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
get a lot of visitors at a bike go up 93
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
in a weekend you'll find any number of
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
vehicles with bikes on them out of state
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
plate so how would you notify those
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
folks of the of the law it seem to be
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
unfriendly to those visitors that are
 
01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
using uh New Hampshire's road to uh bike
 
01:05:14.819 --> 01:05:16.910 align:start position:0%
using uh New Hampshire's road to uh bike
tours

01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
tours
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
um other than that I'd be happy to
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:24.230 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is uh my
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
question is with regardings to electric
 
01:05:33.119 --> 01:05:35.450 align:start position:0%
question is with regardings to electric
bicycles

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
bicycles
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
any thought about that I mean I see
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
those on the on roadways all the time
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
and I'm pretty sure they can do 30 maybe
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
40 miles an hour unless I'm just
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
misjudging that but I'm just my question
 
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
is what do you think about possibly in
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
the future looking at some sort of
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
requirement for those for one mirror
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's a good
 
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
question I
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't consider that as part of this
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
this testimony but I I was at a uh
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
conference a couple of weeks ago when I
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
was hearing about electric bikes that
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
can do as much as 90. um and my
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
perspective a bike that can do 90 is a
 
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.010 align:start position:0%
perspective a bike that can do 90 is a
motorcycle

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
motorcycle
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
um so I would think that they would
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
follow any of the laws applicable to
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
motorcycles so again not subject to this
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
bill necessarily but I I would have
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
concerns about some of those electric
 
01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:30.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
kind of off the topic a little bit but
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps at some point talking about a
 
01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
license plate registering since they're
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
going that fast on our highways
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
and now we're getting way off topic I
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
just throw it out there thank you but uh
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
a conversation for another day
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions for
 
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
the director CNN thank you very much
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
having no one else signed up to speak
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
next up 11 15. see how much I misjudged
 
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:09.980 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:12.980 align:start position:0%
I was expecting a room full actually
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh 11 15 I was Bill 386 enjoy your free
 
01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
the uh actually the prime sponsor of uh
 
01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:29.059 align:start position:0%
host Bill
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
357 said he might be available between
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
quarter of an 11 so hang tight and uh if
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
he's here maybe we can reopen and then
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
close the uh the public hearing on that
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
by 37. okay I'm going to reopen as I
 
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned when the prime sponsor was
 
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
available and I knew this was going to
 
01:37:23.209 --> 01:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
happen when I put the schedule in last
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
week that's right that's why I put in
 
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
this I built in this downtime so I'm
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
going to reopen the public hearing and
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 537. Jay recognizes
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative hole who's in support of
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
transportation for the record
 
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative hole serving the towns of
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton Hooksett Allenstown and have
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
some the bill before you was at the
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
request of
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
one of the New Hampshire citizens who
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
for various reasons would be difficult
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
to get a medical waiver but wanted to
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
make sure she could
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
um add a ceramic tint to the windshield
 
01:38:00.169 --> 01:38:00.179 align:start position:0%
to allow for dealing with ultraviolet
 
01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:03.980 align:start position:0%
and infrared and the ceramic tint
 
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
windshield films don't block as much in
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
the visible spectrum they're actually
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
designed to deal with the non-visible
 
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.250 align:start position:0%
designed to deal with the non-visible
Spectrum

01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
Spectrum
 
01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:14.699 align:start position:0%
um my understanding I wasn't here for
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
the testimony that new cars may actually
 
01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:17.870 align:start position:0%
the testimony that new cars may actually
have

01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
um transmission levels below the 90 and
 
01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
if that's the case we should probably
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
tweak the language a little bit I was
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the maps nationally
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
I do know that the state of New York
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
allows a 70 and I believe the state of
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania as well a 70
 
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
um windshield as well as front and
 
01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:39.020 align:start position:0%
driver side and passenger side window
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
the side windows transmission rate
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
um most of the states already allow much
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
darker than that for rear passenger and
 
01:38:51.250 --> 01:38:51.260 align:start position:0%
rear windshield
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is pretty restrictive when
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
it comes to even the passenger window
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
driver side sorry the passenger driver's
 
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.350 align:start position:0%
driver side sorry the passenger driver's
side

01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
roll down Windows and then the front
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
windshield so the fact that we're more
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
restrictive than than States like New
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
York I think it's something we should
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
we did have a lot of questions on this
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll have one more round if you're
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
up for it any questions from the
 
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.830 align:start position:0%
up for it any questions from the
committee

01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
wow I have one representative hill I'll
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
start it off thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.370 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
ceramic coating that you're
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
um your constituent is looking for right
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
um what does she do
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
in in regular life walking down the
 
01:39:45.169 --> 01:39:45.179 align:start position:0%
street does she have specific glasses
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
that cover that concern that's a good
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
question I can ask I do not know the
 
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:53.219 align:start position:0%
answer to because it would follow up
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
please my my question is why she
 
01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:00.659 align:start position:0%
couldn't continue to use whatever she's
 
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
using in real life while she's driving
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you good question I do know that
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these films is to deal
 
01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
with right some of ceramic for
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet and infrared is to deal with
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
heating of the cars right that's the
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
infrared spectrum and damage to things
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
on the interior which is the ultraviolet
 
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.870 align:start position:0%
on the interior which is the ultraviolet
Spectrum

01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:28.910 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative Fox
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
it was uh confusion on the intent as far
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
as the percentage
 
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
um was the initial intent
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
for you to block 90 or was it
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
and I and I know you're I know that
 
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
you've no clarified the 70 issue with
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
with new motor vehicles but
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding I spoke with the
 
01:40:56.689 --> 01:40:56.699 align:start position:0%
chairman a little bit during the
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
crafting of the bill that you don't you
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't draft the legislation relative to
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
how much it blocks you draft legislation
 
01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
to how much it transmits so it's a
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
visible transmittance number that's
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
what's used I believe us wide and all
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
the states have adopted that set more
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
visible visible light transmittance
 
01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:19.310 align:start position:0%
visible visible light transmittance
number

01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
and in this case I I wanted something
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
less than 100 I was not aware at the
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
time that new vehicles were already
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
below a hundred I just wanted something
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that the ceramic windshield tints
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
that are designed for UV and UltraViolet
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
I mean so ultraviolet and infrared would
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:43.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.050 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:41:45.050 --> 01:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
is this bill moot now considering the
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
constituent that you were concerned
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
about if you were asking for a 90 and
 
01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
they're actually getting 70 percent does
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
she even need
 
01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
well if new windshields are being sold
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
at 70 percent I don't think they're
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
compliant with the law so it makes the
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill that much more
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
important and we should change the 90 to
 
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
a 70 in a committee Amendment right if
 
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
new windshields are truly at 70 percent
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
then why don't we make the law compliant
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay if new manufacturers are saying
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
that the vehicles are transmitting 70
 
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
percent of visible light then we should
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
make this that has not less than 70
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
percent visible light transmittance in
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
both places that are three places four
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
places that it shows up
 
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.950 align:start position:0%
places that it shows up
um

01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.410 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
sellers

01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
sellers
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair are you trying to so
 
01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
if the vehicle is already coming in at
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
70 are you trying to add another 10 to
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
it or take away 10 is that the idea with
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
your 90. so this would not be additive
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
to what's there this would be an
 
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
I was not aware that it was 70 on the
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
front windshield
 
01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.250 align:start position:0%
front windshield
um

01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
um I didn't I don't have I have lots of
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
engineering tools that's my job I don't
 
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
write all sorts of meters of All Sorts
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
but visible light transmittance meters
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
um representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:26.330 align:start position:0%
um representative Hill thank you Mr
chair

01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
um is it your belief that the film The
 
01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:34.139 align:start position:0%
ceramic film that you're talking about
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
changes the
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh light transmittance at all
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
very minimally they're intended to deal
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
with outside of the visible spectrum
 
01:43:47.689 --> 01:43:47.699 align:start position:0%
those coatings
 
01:43:47.699 --> 01:43:49.430 align:start position:0%
those coatings
follow-up

01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up
 
01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.470 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up
um

01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
so would could your bill be amended to
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
eliminate the uh the percentage that you
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
have in there and only talk about the
 
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
ability to add
 
01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:10.189 align:start position:0%
ability to add
ceramic

01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
ceramic
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
film I think that would be a great
 
01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:15.109 align:start position:0%
film I think that would be a great
suggestion

01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.689 --> 01:44:17.699 align:start position:0%
you stole my fire representative Hill uh
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
just just to be clear we I haven't got
 
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
my plan in stone yet but I think after
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
the hearings we've had on both these
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
bills and looking at the current
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
statutes it's pretty confusing so I
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be going down the
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
road whether we
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh do work sessions or retain at the
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
worst but that was my question for you
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
as well because it seems like ceramic
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
Coatings uh is is what you're
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
concentrating on and it does make some
 
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
sense any other questions from the
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
committee this is this question of the
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
chair I see this is an FN I'm not sure
 
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
why I would understand that it's an
 
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
early Bill requiring a fiscal note
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
um not that you guys decide that I get
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:45:01.490 --> 01:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
um it's not real clear
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
um what this would impact in terms of
 
01:45:06.649 --> 01:45:06.659 align:start position:0%
Department spending or state spending in
 
01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
any way I'll look into the fiscal note
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
but so you know it's not been called out
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
as one of my early bills okay thank you
 
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
England thank you very much thank you
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
everybody okay I'm going to close the
 
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:23.010 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 537.
 
01:45:23.010 --> 01:45:24.169 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 537.
[Applause]

01:45:24.169 --> 01:45:24.179 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
in one minute
 
01:53:17.890 --> 01:53:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay being uh 11 22 I'm gonna open up
 
01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and House Bill 386.
 
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh we held off for a few minutes waiting
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor who has not
 
01:53:32.689 --> 01:53:32.699 align:start position:0%
arrived so as a courtesy rep chair
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Hilt to
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
introduce the Bill thank you Mr chairman
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
and for the record I am representative
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
Greg Hill representing the town of
 
01:53:43.729 --> 01:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
Northfield Merrimack II
 
01:53:43.739 --> 01:53:44.510 align:start position:0%
Northfield Merrimack II
um

01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 386 FN
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
a bill that lowers the age in which
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
child passenger must be retrained
 
01:53:57.609 --> 01:53:57.619 align:start position:0%
I think it should be restrained
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
by a child restraint system
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
from ages seven to four
 
01:54:04.139 --> 01:54:05.390 align:start position:0%
from ages seven to four
I

01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
for all purposes I will not be taking
 
01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.950 align:start position:0%
for all purposes I will not be taking
questions

01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
she recognizes Thomas Leach from
 
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health in support of the bill
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
who is seeking 20 to 30 minutes to speak
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that's not going to happen
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
how about five
 
01:54:38.410 --> 01:54:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for entertaining uh my my
 
01:54:43.729 --> 01:54:43.739 align:start position:0%
presence here today my name is Thomas
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
Leach I work at Dartmouth health I am
 
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
the child passenger safety coordinator
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire which is
 
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
funded through a grant from the National
 
01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:56.219 align:start position:0%
Highway Traffic Safety Office to our
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
local office of Highway Safety here in
 
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:55:03.050 --> 01:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire has I thought I'd tell
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
you a little bit about the program so
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
you have an idea of where New Hampshire
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
sits with its current child passenger uh
 
01:55:12.490 --> 01:55:12.500 align:start position:0%
safety record and so on New Hampshire
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
has a fairly robust child passenger
 
01:55:20.410 --> 01:55:20.420 align:start position:0%
safety program we have
 
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
258 certified technicians and when I say
 
01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:26.219 align:start position:0%
certified these are individuals that
 
01:55:28.689 --> 01:55:28.699 align:start position:0%
have gone through a four-day class
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
that was designed through Nitsa and the
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
child passenger safety board in order to
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
kind of the Train the trainer type of
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
situation where these individuals most
 
01:55:43.810 --> 01:55:43.820 align:start position:0%
of whom are either police fire Personnel
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital Personnel or
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
some type of family research Family
 
01:55:51.239 --> 01:55:52.609 align:start position:0%
some type of family research Family
Resource

01:55:52.609 --> 01:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
Resource
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
type of company here in the state that
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
either works through our health and
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
human services or others so we have
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
258 of these individuals and they work
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
out of 62 fitting stations and a fitting
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
station is a location that we advertise
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
on our website and other pamphlets and
 
01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:15.669 align:start position:0%
on our website and other pamphlets and
media

01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
media
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
to direct caregivers and parents where
 
01:56:21.890 --> 01:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
they can go if they have questions
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
regarding their child seats
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
and these are very well received that's
 
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
done usually By Appointment sometimes
 
01:56:32.209 --> 01:56:32.219 align:start position:0%
they'll have an event that many of you
 
01:56:34.729 --> 01:56:34.739 align:start position:0%
might have been by Londonderry does an
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
annual one Dairy quite a few others will
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
do these things where parents can drive
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
in and have their seats inspected make
 
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
sure that they're following all the
 
01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines and so on because they are
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
kind of complicated now those of you
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
that may have experience with child
 
01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
seats for one reason or another probably
 
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
have been and frustrated when you go to
 
01:56:59.209 --> 01:56:59.219 align:start position:0%
install it or harness a child in so it
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
is a complicated thing but New Hampshire
 
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
is doing very well we are closing the
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
gap on making sure that our most
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
vulnerable passengers are traveling as
 
01:57:14.450 --> 01:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
safe and secure as possible through that
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
and it's showing where our injuries are
 
01:57:21.169 --> 01:57:21.179 align:start position:0%
down our fatalities we haven't had any
 
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
in a couple years they're way down we do
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
we do like to talk about injuries more
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
though because those are the things that
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
stay with the child
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
possibly for the rest of their lives and
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
can also cost an exorbitant amount
 
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
amount of funding either through the
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
caregivers or through the state system
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
as well so we're very concerned about
 
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
injuries and that's what brings me here
 
01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
today I'm very concerned about this bill
 
01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
it would allow misuse as designed and
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
defined through the manufacture
 
01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
bachelor's Association that produces
 
01:57:58.490 --> 01:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
these child seats a lot of engineering
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
has gone in to this believe it or not
 
01:58:05.770 --> 01:58:05.780 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a huge relationship
 
01:58:09.250 --> 01:58:09.260 align:start position:0%
between NASCAR and other racing Sports
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
and child passenger safety a lot of the
 
01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
same equipment is used it's just
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
downsized for a child size so we
 
01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to ask our NASCAR drivers
 
01:58:22.129 --> 01:58:22.139 align:start position:0%
and other race car drivers to go back to
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
a three-point harness because they
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they've seen the advantages of
 
01:58:28.609 --> 01:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
the systems they have in their cars
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
right now and those are the same systems
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we see in child seats the
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
engineering that has gone into them just
 
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 years is really quite
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
remarkable and the g-force is that these
 
01:58:44.089 --> 01:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
seats can protect the child from it's
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
just amazing when they're used properly
 
01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
and that's where I come in I try to gain
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
the proper use of these trial seats and
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
by proper use we refer back to the
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of these seats and it
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
usually goes to the point of wanting to
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
keep these children harnessed until they
 
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
maximize the weight and height of the
 
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
seats they're currently using so they
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
don't have to go out and buy any
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
additional seats or whatever they just
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
need to use them until the manufacturer
 
01:59:15.890 --> 01:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
says he or she is too big for this seat
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
and they need to go to a seat belt which
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
is usually around the age of eight it
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
depends on the child as us in here we're
 
01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:27.659 align:start position:0%
all different sizes whatever kids are no
 
01:59:27.659 --> 01:59:28.750 align:start position:0%
all different sizes whatever kids are no
different

01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:59:33.410 --> 01:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
so we try to stay away the industry the
 
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
child seed industry tries to stay away
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
from ages because ages are not
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
efficient they're not effective for
 
01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:43.490 align:start position:0%
efficient they're not effective for
describing

01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
describing
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
the size of a child a four-year-old I
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
could bring five kids in here that are
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
four and they would all be extremely
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
different sizes I'm sure and that is a
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
problem one of the biggest problems if I
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
can go back and grab my my Hands-On
 
01:59:58.800 --> 01:59:59.570 align:start position:0%
can go back and grab my my Hands-On
thing

01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
the demonstration seat we used in our
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
training when we go all around the state
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
and we try and we hold these classes for
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh different individuals I spoke about
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
earlier uh whether it be fire police BMX
 
02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.129 align:start position:0%
earlier uh whether it be fire police BMX
Hospital

02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to be an average
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
three-year-old right we have these
 
02:00:32.530 --> 02:00:32.540 align:start position:0%
training dolls across the switch to me
 
02:00:35.209 --> 02:00:35.219 align:start position:0%
I have them at different sizes so that
 
02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
our technicians in training have an idea
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
of how to Buckle in how to harness up a
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
child with that age maybe there's
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
restrictions on on
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
the type of seat they would be using
 
02:00:49.729 --> 02:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
a one-year-old would not be going into a
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
booster seat or something like that so
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
we really followed the guidelines of the
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so this is a three-year-old
 
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
average three-year-old she is bigger
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
than my
 
02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
granddaughter which is three and a half
 
02:01:10.609 --> 02:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
and she is much bigger and she's just a
 
02:01:13.729 --> 02:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
teeny weeny I think she's weighing in a
 
02:01:18.530 --> 02:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
so this is a three-year-old we didn't
 
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
have a four-year-old unfortunately but
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
this will show you some of the same
 
02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
things that will still happen with
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
four-year-olds if that
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're not spinning properly and none
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
of us sit with our needs straight out if
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:01:37.490 --> 02:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's very uncomfortable so we manipulate
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
our body so that our legs can bend over
 
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
whatever couch chair and so on we're
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
sitting kids will do the same thing they
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
will scooch down so that they can get
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
more comfortable because we all want to
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
be more comfortable the way they do that
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
what happens is the black belt Rises up
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
over there ideally of you and I as well
 
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
we want that laptop over our pelvis
 
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
because above our pelvis our organs and
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're very susceptible to injury
 
02:02:10.729 --> 02:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
from a laptop if there's no shoulder
 
02:02:10.739 --> 02:02:12.109 align:start position:0%
from a laptop if there's no shoulder
problems

02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
so this goes with the laptop to rise up
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
over the abdominal abdominal region a
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
lot of things in there that squishy and
 
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
gushy and can be injured very easily
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
and as you can see the shoulder belt
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
really does not fit well so what happens
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
with kids I see it even with teenage
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
small teenagers that struggle with the
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
seat belt system really different I know
 
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
people in here now what do they do they
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
put it under their arm or Mercy they'll
 
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
just put it behind the backs all right
 
02:02:49.609 --> 02:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
so now we have a very danger for six
 
02:02:55.930 --> 02:02:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.850 --> 02:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
head trauma involverness in the
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of front seat depending on the
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
side seat because parents that
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
five-point Hearts I didn't bring a child
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
semen to me this
 
02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
get the last one
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
but that five-point harness is the same
 
02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
as NASCAR Jack fighter pilots use
 
02:03:19.070 --> 02:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
and it's required
 
02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
it moved up on its own based on
 
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
fatalities that have happened within a
 
02:03:25.609 --> 02:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
racing industry and the child seat
 
02:03:25.619 --> 02:03:27.070 align:start position:0%
racing industry and the child seat
industry

02:03:27.070 --> 02:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
industry
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
they take things from each other because
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're all paying Engineers a lot of
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
money the development sense to Institute
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
Works within a print and this projects
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
may become more vulnerable
 
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
and crash never mind the sign impact
 
02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:44.330 align:start position:0%
and crash never mind the sign impact
issues

02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
seen side impact issues or hurricane or
 
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
strengthening anything within the car
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
this is just her own body weight working
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
against her unfortunately
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
scissoring over and causing abdominal
 
02:03:56.099 --> 02:03:57.350 align:start position:0%
scissoring over and causing abdominal
Matrix

02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
Matrix
 
02:03:59.689 --> 02:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
but instead of 27 years in law
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and my specialty was
 
02:04:04.729 --> 02:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
reconstructing fatal crashes and I have
 
02:04:12.129 --> 02:04:12.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
prematurely and they've done that and it
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
almost always require some type of
 
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
Advanced Medical Assistance I even had
 
02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:20.750 align:start position:0%
Advanced Medical Assistance I even had
one

02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.550 align:start position:0%
one
child

02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
pick out several teeth with their own
 
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.179 align:start position:0%
feet that was that type of way actually
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
did survive for goodness but there's a
 
02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
lot going on so the more we can restrain
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
these little guys uh and as long the
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
longer the better to them developmental
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
reasons another thing is kids don't
 
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
always talk about their injuries because
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
maybe they're not speaking yet or they
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't feel it yet and it's not until you
 
02:04:48.530 --> 02:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
think about it but all of a sudden you
 
02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
realize oh my goodness there's some type
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
of a long-term injury that's going to be
 
02:04:56.330 --> 02:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
dealt with here through you know surgery
 
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.129 align:start position:0%
dealt with here through you know surgery
or

02:04:58.129 --> 02:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
any type of extra therapy to go through
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
and so on and little guys shouldn't have
 
02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:06.659 align:start position:0%
to be able to predict the weather or not
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
do something in school because of an
 
02:05:11.689 --> 02:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
injury they sustained in a car
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
and they have to deal with
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
a shield for that if anybody have any
 
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.390 align:start position:0%
a shield for that if anybody have any
questions

02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you can get back to our microphone
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
too please any questions from the
 
02:05:26.159 --> 02:05:28.010 align:start position:0%
too please any questions from the
committee

02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
leech for taking my question this bill
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
talks about uh taking the restraint
 
02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
stuff from being seven years old to four
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
years old
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
do you have any numbers or statistics in
 
02:05:46.850 --> 02:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of injuries or
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
um that children have had between those
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
ages of like you know four to six I do I
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
wish I brought them with me there was a
 
02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:57.179 align:start position:0%
a panel in in the um
 
02:05:57.179 --> 02:05:57.890 align:start position:0%
a panel in in the um
um

02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
the Senate that did a a pretty in-depth
 
02:06:04.370 --> 02:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
research last year for the rear-facing
 
02:06:07.450 --> 02:06:07.460 align:start position:0%
bill that's out there right now and
 
02:06:09.649 --> 02:06:09.659 align:start position:0%
I'll speak mainly of New Hampshire
 
02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:11.219 align:start position:0%
because that's what I deal with I wish I
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
brought the numbers with me we don't
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
have the best data collection in New
 
02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if that ever comes up that
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's a bill that wants to
 
02:06:20.689 --> 02:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
create a better data system for New
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'll come and I'll testify for
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
you too because it's it's really is
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
needed it makes us uh struggle with
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
trying to find answers like this
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
so I will look at EMS uh responses to
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
answer your question and we see a a
 
02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
curve where our little guys are one two
 
02:06:44.810 --> 02:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
or birth to two-year-olds caregivers are
 
02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
doing a great job with them they're
 
02:06:48.169 --> 02:06:48.179 align:start position:0%
they're really doing well with them
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
they're keeping them in very good seats
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
they seem to be surviving the most as
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
far as injuries go and as they get a
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
little older especially our
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds six through eight year
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
olds they suffer the most on New
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roads with injuries and again
 
02:07:07.609 --> 02:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
it's the injuries that we really got to
 
02:07:10.370 --> 02:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
cut back on because as little kids they
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
those injuries can last a long long time
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
so I hope that I hope that I didn't
 
02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
bring the data with me uh it is
 
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
available through
 
02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
available through
um

02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
I can email it to somebody if he was
 
02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
just going to say if you could if you
 
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
could get that to us as a committee
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
that'd be great it's collected it's
 
02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
collected from the crash reports that
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
are done uh via either the state police
 
02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
system or the local system as well and I
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
actually get it from the um DMV
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any other questions from
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Hill thank
 
02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for coming
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
in and testifying
 
02:07:46.679 --> 02:07:47.450 align:start position:0%
in and testifying
um

02:07:47.450 --> 02:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:50.089 --> 02:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly
 
02:07:50.099 --> 02:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly
uh

02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm you're you're against this bill but
 
02:07:56.450 --> 02:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:07:58.129 --> 02:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
um suggest that
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
it may be more appropriate for our
 
02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
current statute to list
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
um height and weight and all of those
 
02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
kind of things rather than our current
 
02:08:11.689 --> 02:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
statute that lists ages is that what I'm
 
02:08:13.689 --> 02:08:13.699 align:start position:0%
hearing from you
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point and the reason
 
02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the reason that ages
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
are used as much as they are in statutes
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
is for the enforcement part of it you're
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
not going to have an officer on the side
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
of the road with a scale or maybe a tape
 
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
measure and and there isn't a lot of
 
02:08:32.689 --> 02:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
written enforcement that happens with
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
this law I know from my own personal
 
02:08:35.689 --> 02:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
experience and I see it with the numbers
 
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire what this does is
 
02:08:39.649 --> 02:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
it opens up an opportunity for a
 
02:08:43.490 --> 02:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
roadside education where there could be
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
something that an officer sees is
 
02:08:47.689 --> 02:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
definitely off and they can have that
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
conversation with the caregiver to
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
educate them on proper use because that
 
02:08:54.410 --> 02:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
is the goal to modify people's behavior
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times that will happen
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
without any summonses being issued on
 
02:09:00.649 --> 02:09:00.659 align:start position:0%
the side we have a lot of technicians
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are police officers and I know
 
02:09:05.209 --> 02:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
speaking to them that is their goal is
 
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
that when Mom or Dad or the caregiver
 
02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.450 align:start position:0%
that when Mom or Dad or the caregiver
leaves

02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
leaves
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
um the the roadside traffic stop that
 
02:09:14.089 --> 02:09:14.099 align:start position:0%
that child is safer than when they
 
02:09:16.010 --> 02:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
originally stopped
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
um and so on but as far as excuse me
 
02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
getting back to your question yes um
 
02:09:25.010 --> 02:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
it all depends on the engineering that
 
02:09:26.689 --> 02:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
has gone into these seats in the last 10
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
years is remarkable so on the side of
 
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
every seat is a very well laid out
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
labeling system that defines the size of
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
a child that should be in the seat and
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
how it should be used and that's what
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
the law also says on there that a
 
02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
properly used child restraint according
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
to the seat manufacturers
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
and that's really the key right there to
 
02:09:52.609 --> 02:09:52.619 align:start position:0%
do that whether or not an age is in
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
there it can help have that conversation
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
however in in my opinion it would be
 
02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
great if New Hampshire had an age eight
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh or even nine with a size cut out
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
where we would want kids in seats until
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
age eight at least unless they were so
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
high and I'm sorry so heavy and so tall
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
which is part of of the original statute
 
02:10:19.850 --> 02:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
anyway with the 57 inches
 
02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:23.229 align:start position:0%
anyway with the 57 inches
foreign

02:10:23.229 --> 02:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
would you be able to provide us what
 
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
that cut out and those Heights and
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
weights and should be
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
as far as well you just mentioned that
 
02:10:37.129 --> 02:10:37.139 align:start position:0%
they were uh you would prefer to have it
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
up to age eight with with cutouts and
 
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you could provide
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
us what those cutouts should be it would
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
stay the same believe it or not because
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's the the cutout it's written in
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
the law now that says up to age seven
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
not not the bill but the current law
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
that we have and it says and children up
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
to age seven and up to 57 87 inches so
 
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
that would stay the same even though you
 
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
went to AJ because once a kid reaches 57
 
02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:08.089 align:start position:0%
went to AJ because once a kid reaches 57
inches

02:11:08.089 --> 02:11:08.099 align:start position:0%
inches
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
99 of the time acceptable to go into a
 
02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
booster seat they would fit properly
 
02:11:17.089 --> 02:11:17.099 align:start position:0%
into a booster seat at that time because
 
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
the problem with
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
seat belts and vehicles they're designed
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
for adults
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
and they're designed for different size
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
adults but they none of them go down low
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
enough to do a child properly so that's
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
why we want to keep kids at least in a
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
booster seat until
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know ideally under nine but again
 
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
have that exception that if it's a big
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
kid you know they don't have to stay in
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
the seat you know if they're 57 inches
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
then they should be in a booster seat
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
and if if they reach the maximum of
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
their booster seat then they can sit in
 
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
a seat belt
 
02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:52.030 align:start position:0%
a seat belt
yep

02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you sir for
 
02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
is it not true that seat belts that are
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
put in cars today are in fact designed
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
for adults
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
bye

02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
bye
 
02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:23.810 align:start position:0%
bye
um

02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out that
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
are you saying the parents aren't doing
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
a good job
 
02:12:33.050 --> 02:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh protecting their children
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
you know because we want to drop the age
 
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
you don't think they go do a good job as
 
02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
you don't think they go do a good job as
well

02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
I think many will will continue to do
 
02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
what they're doing now without a doubt
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
the problem is we have this conversation
 
02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:48.770 align:start position:0%
the problem is we have this conversation
um

02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of issues going on with
 
02:12:53.689 --> 02:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
with raising kids obviously and some
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
parents are more prepared than others
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
and others are reaching out to try to
 
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
figure out what it is and they may talk
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
to their next door neighbor they may
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
talk to a relative they may get their
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
initial child seat education maybe at
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
the hospital when they have a child a
 
02:13:13.609 --> 02:13:13.619 align:start position:0%
lot of things happen though until that
 
02:13:15.890 --> 02:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
kid gets to be four or five years old
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
there may be another introduction of a
 
02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
sibling doesn't mean that the caregiver
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
cares any less about that five-year-old
 
02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
or the four-year-old it just means
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more distraction now in
 
02:13:29.149 --> 02:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
that family than just one child maybe
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's additional siblings all right
 
02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
there may also be an issue with a
 
02:13:39.050 --> 02:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
language barrier going on and this whole
 
02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
idea is to keep that message consistent
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
our message in New Hampshire matches the
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
message in Vermont matches the message
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
in Maine in the rest of the country
 
02:13:53.689 --> 02:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
all right so no matter where these
 
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
people look for their information
 
02:13:58.370 --> 02:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's going to be consistent if we
 
02:14:00.649 --> 02:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
deviate from that it's going to give a
 
02:14:00.659 --> 02:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
deviate from that it's going to give a
mixed

02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
mixed
 
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:02.709 align:start position:0%
mixed
um

02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
message to the parents that oh okay
 
02:14:08.569 --> 02:14:08.579 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
a way to do this no parent is going to
 
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
deliberately put their kids in an unsafe
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
situation but we see it all the day
 
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
every day at our checkpoints where moms
 
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
and dads want to see that beautiful
 
02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:22.089 align:start position:0%
and dads want to see that beautiful
little

02:14:22.089 --> 02:14:22.099 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
14-month baby and they turn the kid
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
forward facing all right
 
02:14:30.649 --> 02:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
um if if they can find someone just to
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
say oh yeah I did that then they feel
 
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
like they're they're not really doing
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
anything wrong and we're still combating
 
02:14:40.370 --> 02:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
that message so we're trying to be as
 
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
consistent as ever so if we change the
 
02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
message and we drop it down to four
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
you're right there's going to be some
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
parents that are going to do a fantastic
 
02:14:49.729 --> 02:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
job but there's going to be a much
 
02:14:51.890 --> 02:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
larger percentage that are going to get
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
the wrong message and they may be happy
 
02:14:56.450 --> 02:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
with just tossing that kid in the front
 
02:14:59.810 --> 02:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
seat of that car with a seat belt which
 
02:15:01.490 --> 02:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
would be really bad because as
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes mentioned before
 
02:15:06.109 --> 02:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
seat belts are designed for adults many
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
of you you may not even know it unless
 
02:15:10.609 --> 02:15:10.619 align:start position:0%
you've had a crash in your car you have
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
in your front seat you probably had
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
pre-tensioners which are these small
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
little explosive devices that go off
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
that pull the seat belt tight and it's
 
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
not designed for a child to be sitting
 
02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
in that we also have frontal airbags
 
02:15:27.290 --> 02:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
which are very unsafe for kids they're
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
the ones that exist in in front of the
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
child all right so we want to keep kids
 
02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
in the back seat we want to keep kids in
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
their child seats as long as possible
 
02:15:39.709 --> 02:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
and this is the the guidance of the
 
02:15:41.689 --> 02:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics and I
 
02:15:44.089 --> 02:15:44.099 align:start position:0%
don't know why anybody would want to go
 
02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
against the Academy of Pediatrics when
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
we do take the time to bring our
 
02:15:51.890 --> 02:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
children to the doctor we do take the
 
02:15:53.930 --> 02:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
time to look after their well-being if
 
02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
they get hurt we go to the hospital and
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
we listen so I I feel that transporting
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
children should be no different and we
 
02:16:02.930 --> 02:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
should follow the guidelines of the
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
standards and that is to keep kids in
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
their seats as long as possible until
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
they outgrow them
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
foreign I hope that helped answer your
 
02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
question what are the questions from the
 
02:16:18.179 --> 02:16:22.030 align:start position:0%
question what are the questions from the
committee

02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.040 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman Mr Elise you you put on your
 
02:16:34.209 --> 02:16:34.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
thank you you put on your pink card that
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
you support the bill I think you mean
 
02:16:42.169 --> 02:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
you oh I apologize that was and I also
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
put the wrong build on because I was
 
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
looking at the I'm just talking with you
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
I am opposed to the to the bill moving
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
the the age to four years old I
 
02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
apologize for that confusion
 
02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:53.810 align:start position:0%
apologize for that confusion
representative

02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:16:56.570 --> 02:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
um so you're concern about changing the
 
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
law from from seven to four would send
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:17:05.089 --> 02:17:05.099 align:start position:0%
people would interpret it as
 
02:17:07.009 --> 02:17:07.019 align:start position:0%
confirmation that they don't need to put
 
02:17:09.049 --> 02:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
their kids in a child seat that they
 
02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:11.099 align:start position:0%
would use that as kind of a
 
02:17:11.099 --> 02:17:12.530 align:start position:0%
would use that as kind of a
uh

02:17:12.530 --> 02:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:15.410 --> 02:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
their Bellwether a rationality doesn't
 
02:17:18.049 --> 02:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
require it so it can't be that important
 
02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
I agree and also don't forget there
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of a financial
 
02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility to keep children in seats
 
02:17:27.650 --> 02:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
because the progression these were
 
02:17:29.570 --> 02:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
pieces of safety equipment and that's
 
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
just been noted by by so many of you
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
these are adult seat belts so they need
 
02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
this specialized safety equipment to
 
02:17:37.250 --> 02:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
make sure the seat belt works properly
 
02:17:40.730 --> 02:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
for for them and I think if you said
 
02:17:42.530 --> 02:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
after four you didn't need a child seat
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
which basically is is the underlying
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
tone of it
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
um you'll have parents go oh I'm done
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
with child seats now and they'll just
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
have the kids wherever in the car and I
 
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
think we would see
 
02:17:58.849 --> 02:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
really see some horrific numbers in that
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
based on how far we've come seat belts
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry child seats really started to
 
02:18:05.399 --> 02:18:06.290 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry child seats really started to
take

02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:18:08.810 --> 02:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
a strong foothold not until the late
 
02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:10.570 align:start position:0%
a strong foothold not until the late
1990s

02:18:10.570 --> 02:18:10.580 align:start position:0%
1990s
 
02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
and they've been going great ever since
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
especially in the last 10 years like I
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
said the engineering that's gotten into
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
them and and the reality of it we've
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
learned from our children that and NASA
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
has proved this many times with how they
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
send astronauts into space when it comes
 
02:18:30.889 --> 02:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
to being in a moving object we should
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
all be facing backwards I know I
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't like it but if we want to
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
survive any type of serious crashes
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's what NASA says we should do so I
 
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
am afraid that the message would be
 
02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:43.790 align:start position:0%
am afraid that the message would be
blurred

02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
blurred
 
02:18:46.310 --> 02:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
and and we would lose some people in
 
02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
there that are struggling with
 
02:18:49.250 --> 02:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
everything they're struggling with their
 
02:18:50.570 --> 02:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
bills they're struggling with their
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
children they're struggling with with so
 
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
much going on that the last thing they
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
need is one more inconsistent message to
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
02:19:07.969 --> 02:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much and I stand
 
02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
corrected you got your 30 minutes after
 
02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:12.290 align:start position:0%
corrected you got your 30 minutes after
all

02:19:12.290 --> 02:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:14.780 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh representing AAA Dan Goodman
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:27.230 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
02:19:31.849 --> 02:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
committee uh I will be very brief uh for
 
02:19:33.169 --> 02:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Dan Goodman I'm
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
the manager of public affairs for AAA
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
Northern New England uh to answer one of
 
02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
the questions about uh car seats
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
um there's extreme misuse in New
 
02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the country
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
regarding car seats according to data
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
collected by organizations like Tom and
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh and across country up to 50 between
 
02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
52 84 percent of car seats across the
 
02:20:00.050 --> 02:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
country are installed incorrectly and
 
02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
the number one reason is they're in the
 
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
wrong misuse of the car seat so they're
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
in the wrong car seat for their age and
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
weight so it's a major major issue and
 
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
as I wear a post this bill we couldn't
 
02:20:12.889 --> 02:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
find another state that has ever
 
02:20:14.810 --> 02:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
attempted to do something like this to
 
02:20:16.849 --> 02:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
repeal to weaken their child passenger
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
safety law New Hampshire would be the
 
02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:20.690 align:start position:0%
safety law New Hampshire would be the
first

02:20:20.690 --> 02:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
um as Tom mentioned young kids are our
 
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable motor vehicle users it's
 
02:20:28.969 --> 02:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
the number one reason car crashes are
 
02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
the number one cause of death for
 
02:20:32.450 --> 02:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
children between 3 and 14. we think
 
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
weakening those laws would just make it
 
02:20:34.380 --> 02:20:35.750 align:start position:0%
weakening those laws would just make it
worse

02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
worse
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
um as he mentioned the Academy of
 
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
American pediatricians recommended a
 
02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:41.660 align:start position:0%
booster seat is recommended
 
02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
typically to 8 to 12 years old or four
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
foot nine according to this bill Tom
 
02:20:48.050 --> 02:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
wanted me to bring my daughter who's
 
02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
almost four to be that to be that demo
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
instead of that little dummy she's
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
almost force transfer in a few weeks
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
she's three feet tall and 35 pounds so
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
according to the American Academy of
 
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
Pediatricians you know they're saying
 
02:21:04.610 --> 02:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
four feet nine inches at least so uh
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's a very strong recommendation
 
02:21:07.319 --> 02:21:08.929 align:start position:0%
that's a very strong recommendation
um

02:21:08.929 --> 02:21:08.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and we I did find a little data and
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
this is National Data by the Children's
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
Hospital of Philadelphia uh children
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
seen in a booster seat in the rear of
 
02:21:19.370 --> 02:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
the car are 45 less likely to be injured
 
02:21:21.530 --> 02:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
in a car crash as compared to those
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
children using a seat belt alone
 
02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
um so with that
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
um that is that is all I'm happy to
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%

city of Lebanon
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm pleased to introduce House Bill
 
03:34:38.690 --> 03:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
570 which concerns language about
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
um real ID driver's licenses
 
03:34:42.120 --> 03:34:43.070 align:start position:0%

um

03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:48.290 --> 03:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:51.050 --> 03:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
we have been engaged in we meaning
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
myself and various
 
03:34:53.160 --> 03:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
myself and various
um

03:34:54.710 --> 03:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
constituent groups have been engaged
 
03:34:59.809 --> 03:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Motor Vehicles to
 
03:35:04.490 --> 03:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
try and find uh common ground on what
 
03:35:06.590 --> 03:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to do to address and
 
03:35:08.450 --> 03:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk about what we're
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
03:35:13.250 --> 03:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is bring
 
03:35:16.570 --> 03:35:16.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's real ID requirements
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
Interline with the federal real ID
 
03:35:21.550 --> 03:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
requirements there's a slight disconnect
 
03:35:24.660 --> 03:35:24.670 align:start position:0%
I view this as a
 
03:35:24.670 --> 03:35:24.889 align:start position:0%
I view this as a
[Music]

03:35:24.889 --> 03:35:24.899 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:35:24.899 --> 03:35:26.690 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:35:26.690 --> 03:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
attack that's not so much a technical
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
but maybe even it's not too far of a
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
stretch to say a housekeeping matter
 
03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to bring those two
 
03:35:38.750 --> 03:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
versions of the law into compliance with
 
03:35:39.969 --> 03:35:39.979 align:start position:0%
each other
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
we've been engaged with the DMV for for
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
a great length and um
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have made some real progress but the
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
more progress needs to be done so what
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to do is today is to give the
 
03:35:58.969 --> 03:35:58.979 align:start position:0%
DMV and the constituent groups
 
03:36:00.830 --> 03:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
um their opportunity to talk to you
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
about where we are what we're doing and
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
how it's going
 
03:36:06.530 --> 03:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
with an eye toward
 
03:36:06.540 --> 03:36:07.309 align:start position:0%
with an eye toward
um

03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps an amendment perhaps uh some
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
other parliamentary Maneuvers whatever
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
it is that we need to do to continue to
 
03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
make good law here before the
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
transportation committee
 
03:36:22.969 --> 03:36:22.979 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions if uh if
 
03:36:24.769 --> 03:36:24.779 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
03:36:26.690 --> 03:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:40.370 --> 03:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
chair like to recognize uh jiel's
 
03:36:43.130 --> 03:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
bassinet did I get that right
 
03:36:46.610 --> 03:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
thank you uh from the ACLU who's in
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
support to Bill who is looking to speak
 
03:36:49.790 --> 03:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
for one minute
 
03:36:54.290 --> 03:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry
 
03:36:58.969 --> 03:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
you know I've done that many times so
 
03:37:00.769 --> 03:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
you think I would know but uh
 
03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:02.819 align:start position:0%
gilbissonet legal director at the ACLU
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we support this bill
 
03:37:08.690 --> 03:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
um and just to Echo the the testimony of
 
03:37:10.849 --> 03:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
the sponsor very briefly I I to some
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
extent really think this is a
 
03:37:13.969 --> 03:37:13.979 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill maybe there are
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
administrative issues that need to be
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
sorted out but from a legal perspective
 
03:37:19.070 --> 03:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
if this is a housekeeping Bill really
 
03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
designed to make sure that state law
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility for a driver's license
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
matches real ID eligibility under
 
03:37:31.130 --> 03:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
federal law that simple right now there
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
is a gap
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
between those who are eligible for real
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
IDs under federal law which is a little
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
bit more expansive and you look at state
 
03:37:43.309 --> 03:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
law and it's narrower and so we're
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
trying to bridge that Gap and just to be
 
03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
blunt that Gap exists with respect to
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
um not some non-citizens who are
 
03:37:52.670 --> 03:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
lawfully in the United States I want to
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
be very clear that's who we're talking
 
03:37:56.269 --> 03:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
about so under the federal real ID
 
03:37:57.769 --> 03:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
statute and this is going to be in my
 
03:37:59.210 --> 03:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I'll circulate
 
03:38:00.889 --> 03:38:00.899 align:start position:0%
just so no one has to take notes but
 
03:38:04.729 --> 03:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
under the federal real ID statute
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
um individuals who have approved Refugee
 
03:38:09.769 --> 03:38:09.779 align:start position:0%
status individuals who have valid
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
non-immigrant visas Etc our intent are
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to have a federal real ID but
 
03:38:17.269 --> 03:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
when you look at New Hampshire statute
 
03:38:19.190 --> 03:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
with respect to non-citizens who are
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
lawfully in the United States that
 
03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
criteria is much narrow right you're
 
03:38:25.570 --> 03:38:25.580 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who are attending school
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with individuals who are
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
here for the purposes of engaging in
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
lawful employment occupational business
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
activity and who are engaged in that
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
activity Etc but it's just a little bit
 
03:38:41.389 --> 03:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
narrower in fact significantly narrower
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
than what federal law allows so we're
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
again we're just trying to bridge that
 
03:38:46.729 --> 03:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
Gap to make sure that we're consistent
 
03:38:48.530 --> 03:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
with the federal real ID statute and it
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
would have a real impact on individuals
 
03:38:51.710 --> 03:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
who are lawfully in the United States
 
03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:56.450 --> 03:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you Mr
 
03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:08.330 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you Mr
chairman

03:39:08.330 --> 03:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.190 --> 03:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
and GEOS do you have written testimony
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
I I noticed an error in my written

here with Michael Mercier who is the
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
administrator of driver licensing at the
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
DMV I want to thank you for giving us
 
03:39:54.170 --> 03:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak with you this
 
03:39:54.180 --> 03:39:55.610 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak with you this
afternoon

03:39:55.610 --> 03:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
03:39:57.530 --> 03:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
um I'll start with echoing everything
 
03:39:59.330 --> 03:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
that representative Sykes mentioned
 
03:40:01.969 --> 03:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
about conversations that we've been
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
having with the representative and many
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
of the Great constituents and Community
 
03:40:10.130 --> 03:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
leaders behind me and we've been talking
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
about a variety of bills this this is
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
03:40:15.290 --> 03:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
um so what I would like to do is and the
 
03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
reason that we're offering informational
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
testimony is to give you a little bit of
 
03:40:22.309 --> 03:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
insight into some of those areas within
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
the bill and within the real ID act and
 
03:40:26.450 --> 03:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
within the state law that we are
 
03:40:28.490 --> 03:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
dissecting and trying to make sure that
 
03:40:31.190 --> 03:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
we get to the right answer and make sure
 
03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we offer you all the information
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
that you need to make the right decision
 
03:40:37.929 --> 03:40:37.939 align:start position:0%
so if you look at
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
263 14b
 
03:40:44.450 --> 03:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RSA 26314b driver's
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
license compliant with public law
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
it talks about
 
03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:49.969 align:start position:0%
it talks about
um

03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety May issue
 
03:40:55.969 --> 03:40:55.979 align:start position:0%
May issue upon request driver's licenses
 
03:40:57.710 --> 03:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
which meets the standards of the real ID
 
03:41:01.849 --> 03:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
Act of 2005. so
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's the first start so we can do that
 
03:41:07.070 --> 03:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
legally we can follow what's in the real
 
03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
ID act and issue the real ID to all of
 
03:41:12.050 --> 03:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
those parameters that are within the act
 
03:41:12.060 --> 03:41:13.729 align:start position:0%
those parameters that are within the act
itself

03:41:13.729 --> 03:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the real ID Act of
 
03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
2005 and you go to special requirements
 
03:41:23.929 --> 03:41:23.939 align:start position:0%
and you get to the section number two
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
special requirements be evidence of
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
lawful status
 
03:41:29.450 --> 03:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
and then it goes into a state shell
 
03:41:31.250 --> 03:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
require before issuing a driver's
 
03:41:33.290 --> 03:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
license or identification card to a
 
03:41:35.690 --> 03:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
person valid documentary evidence that
 
03:41:37.010 --> 03:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
the person
 
03:41:39.650 --> 03:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
one is a citizen or national of the
 
03:41:40.849 --> 03:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
United States
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
two is an alien lawfully admitted for
 
03:41:45.410 --> 03:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
permanent or temporary residents in the
 
03:41:48.290 --> 03:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
United States three has conditional
 
03:41:49.849 --> 03:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
permanent resonance status in the United
 
03:41:49.859 --> 03:41:51.170 align:start position:0%
permanent resonance status in the United
States

03:41:51.170 --> 03:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
4 has an approved application for asylum
 
03:41:56.330 --> 03:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
in the United States or has entered into
 
03:41:58.929 --> 03:41:58.939 align:start position:0%
the United States in a refugee status
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
all of those that you go through you can
 
03:42:04.910 --> 03:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
recognize has been approved uh has legal
 
03:42:07.370 --> 03:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
status so those are all areas of the
 
03:42:09.170 --> 03:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
real ID act you can look at and say well
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
that that makes sense we understand that
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
um one of the areas though that has been
 
03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
a topic of conversation for uh for my
 
03:42:19.130 --> 03:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
leadership team and the group here is
 
03:42:19.140 --> 03:42:20.389 align:start position:0%
leadership team and the group here is
really

03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
um section six Which states has a
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
pending application for asylum in the
 
03:42:27.950 --> 03:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
United States so
 
03:42:30.530 --> 03:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
when you get into the pending Asylum
 
03:42:30.540 --> 03:42:32.229 align:start position:0%
when you get into the pending Asylum
status

03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
status
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
the question then becomes what does that
 
03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:36.710 align:start position:0%
the question then becomes what does that
mean

03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and what does it mean when an
 
03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
application is has been fully vetted by
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Homeland Security to
 
03:42:46.010 --> 03:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that the person receives the
 
03:42:48.410 --> 03:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
full asylee status so
 
03:42:48.420 --> 03:42:49.010 align:start position:0%
full asylee status so
um

03:42:49.010 --> 03:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:50.210 --> 03:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason this is
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
informational testimony as well is that
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
as I said this is research and some of
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
that research was still taking place on
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
the way over here some of it took place
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
last week we had a conference call with
 
03:43:04.429 --> 03:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
Amba the American Association of Motor
 
03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
Vehicle administrators and a
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative from Homeland Security
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
for about 45 minutes and that
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
conversation centered around the real ID
 
03:43:15.530 --> 03:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
act and in particular that's section six
 
03:43:17.690 --> 03:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
what does that mean what does that mean
 
03:43:19.910 --> 03:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
and so what was explained during that
 
03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
call was that
 
03:43:22.200 --> 03:43:23.090 align:start position:0%
call was that
um

03:43:23.090 --> 03:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
unlike a refugee somebody who is in the
 
03:43:26.889 --> 03:43:26.899 align:start position:0%
United States
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
goes and fills out the application for
 
03:43:33.410 --> 03:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
Asylum they fill out that application
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
they submit that to the federal
 
03:43:36.830 --> 03:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
government they get a receipt that
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
they've submitted that application
 
03:43:41.090 --> 03:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
now during that call that we had last
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
week I was told that there was uh you
 
03:43:45.650 --> 03:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
know it was just that a receipt that
 
03:43:47.630 --> 03:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
you've submitted something
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
I was told on the way over from John
 
03:43:51.650 --> 03:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
Mills who is uh the representative from
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security that um he did some
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
checking even within the last hour and
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
there is some level of vetting that
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
takes place when that initial
 
03:44:02.090 --> 03:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
application is submitted so that's new
 
03:44:02.100 --> 03:44:03.590 align:start position:0%
application is submitted so that's new
information

03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so that's good what that level of
 
03:44:07.250 --> 03:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
vetting is
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
he's going to get that information for
 
03:44:12.349 --> 03:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
me but we don't have it as of right now
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
but it is more than just the receipt
 
03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
which is what we were believing last
 
03:44:18.530 --> 03:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
week there is some vetting that takes
 
03:44:18.540 --> 03:44:19.670 align:start position:0%
week there is some vetting that takes
place

03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:44:22.490 --> 03:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
the application is received and it takes
 
03:44:25.250 --> 03:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
about 30 days for
 
03:44:27.050 --> 03:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
the federal government to review the
 
03:44:30.769 --> 03:44:30.779 align:start position:0%
application and to determine identity
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
so what happens is after about that 30
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
day Mark they can tell you that this
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
piece of paper that says John marasco
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
and here's his address and date of birth
 
03:44:40.130 --> 03:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
all the information that's listed on the
 
03:44:40.140 --> 03:44:41.349 align:start position:0%
all the information that's listed on the
application

03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:44:44.690 --> 03:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
is true and accurate
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
so that's a really good thing that's
 
03:44:48.590 --> 03:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
good to know so at that 30 day Mark we
 
03:44:51.050 --> 03:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
have true identity
 
03:44:53.690 --> 03:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
as Homeland Security explained it that's
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
your first as they use the word touch
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
point the touch point is to figure out
 
03:44:59.210 --> 03:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
now that you have a person's true
 
03:45:01.729 --> 03:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
identity is that enough to issue a real
 
03:45:01.739 --> 03:45:02.929 align:start position:0%
identity is that enough to issue a real
ID

03:45:02.929 --> 03:45:02.939 align:start position:0%
ID
 
03:45:04.729 --> 03:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
well that's phase one of the process
 
03:45:06.769 --> 03:45:06.779 align:start position:0%
through the federal government phase two
 
03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
is the person is brought in for an
 
03:45:11.389 --> 03:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
interview and the person undergoes a
 
03:45:13.370 --> 03:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
background check and if they pass the
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
interview in the background check
 
03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
then the process is essentially
 
03:45:17.160 --> 03:45:18.290 align:start position:0%
then the process is essentially
completed

03:45:18.290 --> 03:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
completed
 
03:45:20.530 --> 03:45:20.540 align:start position:0%
the person is eligible for
 
03:45:22.969 --> 03:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
they've completed the process for a real
 
03:45:22.979 --> 03:45:24.530 align:start position:0%
they've completed the process for a real
ID

03:45:24.530 --> 03:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
ID
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
um that can take although they wouldn't
 
03:45:28.250 --> 03:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
give us an exact time frame that could
 
03:45:31.250 --> 03:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
take potentially a year or more for the
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
the interview and the background check
 
03:45:34.610 --> 03:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
to be completed
 
03:45:34.620 --> 03:45:35.809 align:start position:0%
to be completed
so

03:45:35.809 --> 03:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
decisions that have to be made are
 
03:45:38.160 --> 03:45:38.809 align:start position:0%
decisions that have to be made are
um

03:45:38.809 --> 03:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
what happens if you issue the temporary
 
03:45:46.729 --> 03:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh real ID to somebody that
 
03:45:46.739 --> 03:45:47.929 align:start position:0%
uh real ID to somebody that
um

03:45:47.929 --> 03:45:47.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:49.490 --> 03:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
got the receipt because they submitted
 
03:45:51.170 --> 03:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
the application there's some level of
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
vetting that goes on there we don't to
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
this point know exactly what that is
 
03:45:57.290 --> 03:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
um is that the time to issue the real ID
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
which is a higher level credential than
 
03:46:01.969 --> 03:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
a regular New Hampshire driver's license
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
is it the right time to do it then is it
 
03:46:06.410 --> 03:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
the right time to do it at the 30-day
 
03:46:07.849 --> 03:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
Mark when you've got positive
 
03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
identification with what's on the
 
03:46:09.899 --> 03:46:10.910 align:start position:0%
identification with what's on the
application

03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
or is it best to wait until the process
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
is played out albeit a long one and the
 
03:46:19.010 --> 03:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
person has been properly identified they
 
03:46:20.929 --> 03:46:20.939 align:start position:0%
have had an interview they have had a
 
03:46:23.210 --> 03:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
federal background and they have been
 
03:46:25.849 --> 03:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
approved to receive the real ID those
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
are some of the conversations that um
 
03:46:30.769 --> 03:46:30.779 align:start position:0%
that we're working through and that
 
03:46:32.170 --> 03:46:32.180 align:start position:0%
we've been having
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
I could tell you that the more that we
 
03:46:37.010 --> 03:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
research this topic
 
03:46:39.889 --> 03:46:39.899 align:start position:0%
um you know and I I think that what you
 
03:46:41.690 --> 03:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
really need to do is have some attorneys
 
03:46:43.729 --> 03:46:43.739 align:start position:0%
take a look at it for the state the
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
other thing is we have to stay in
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
compliance with the real ID act we have
 
03:46:48.410 --> 03:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
to stay in compliance with it so I asked
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
John Mills from the federal government
 
03:46:53.389 --> 03:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
on the way over here where we stand on
 
03:46:55.790 --> 03:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
that if John Mills we're not doing
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
everything that's in the real ID act
 
03:46:57.420 --> 03:46:58.729 align:start position:0%
everything that's in the real ID act
today

03:46:58.729 --> 03:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
because we're not
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
um are we in compliance with the real ID
 
03:47:04.729 --> 03:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
act and he said we show up green on the
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
screen that we are in compliance with
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
the real ID act and that's where the
 
03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
state law that says you may issue the
 
03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
real ID
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
in these um for these certain uh
 
03:47:19.610 --> 03:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
criteria you may do that but you may not
 
03:47:23.330 --> 03:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
so the DMV has not been
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
um issuing real IDs generally speaking
 
03:47:28.190 --> 03:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
for some of the categories that are on
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
here with the silees now somebody that
 
03:47:32.210 --> 03:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
completes the process the administrative
 
03:47:34.849 --> 03:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
rules for the DMV you you get once
 
03:47:37.309 --> 03:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
you've completed the Asylum process you
 
03:47:39.050 --> 03:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
you can get the real ID
 
03:47:40.849 --> 03:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
you can you've had those three things
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
proper identification interview
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
background you you can get the New
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license
 
03:47:47.399 --> 03:47:48.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license
um

03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the things that
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're working through
 
03:47:55.190 --> 03:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and I think that uh you know we're
 
03:47:56.690 --> 03:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions I'll also
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Mike who oversees
 
03:47:59.929 --> 03:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
licensing but these are some areas that
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
we are working through
 
03:48:02.279 --> 03:48:07.309 align:start position:0%
we are working through
Fair

03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.170 --> 03:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
does Mike want to say anything or before
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no okay sorry for a second
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay there you go okay
 
03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee
 
03:48:19.010 --> 03:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative say clear
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh if you if the
 
03:48:23.450 --> 03:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
state was to
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
issue the license after step two instead
 
03:48:28.250 --> 03:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
of waiting another waiting a year up to
 
03:48:31.610 --> 03:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
a year would it be impossible for if if
 
03:48:33.889 --> 03:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
something was wrong to just revoke the
 
03:48:37.190 --> 03:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
license like we do with drivers now in
 
03:48:40.849 --> 03:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:40.859 --> 03:48:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:48:43.190 --> 03:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
the only the only issue with that would
 
03:48:47.150 --> 03:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
be how would we be notified if something
 
03:48:49.190 --> 03:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
happened you know it had to be either
 
03:48:51.830 --> 03:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
from the state department Department of
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security uh maybe a law
 
03:48:56.210 --> 03:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
enforcement group we would have no way
 
03:48:59.330 --> 03:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
to vet that if it went past it or before
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
the the to the Second Step that you're
 
03:49:04.490 --> 03:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
talking about we can issue a license we
 
03:49:06.290 --> 03:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
can issue a New Hampshire license it
 
03:49:07.849 --> 03:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
just won't be a New Hampshire comp our
 
03:49:12.889 --> 03:49:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up I may have missed something
 
03:49:18.889 --> 03:49:18.899 align:start position:0%
but you you could I mean when when
 
03:49:21.729 --> 03:49:21.739 align:start position:0%
somebody's licenses check on a road stop
 
03:49:23.929 --> 03:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll run the license through
 
03:49:26.929 --> 03:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
correct real ID or not so couldn't that
 
03:49:29.330 --> 03:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
be done if uh or wouldn't that be done
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
if somebody shows a real ID that did it
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
temporarily and but this you guys
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
revoked it because they didn't pass the
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
third test wouldn't that be enough to
 
03:49:42.229 --> 03:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
have that license taken away right there
 
03:49:43.370 --> 03:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
on the spot
 
03:49:43.380 --> 03:49:44.570 align:start position:0%
on the spot
I'll

03:49:44.570 --> 03:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
03:49:47.210 --> 03:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
it would if it happened if if they ran
 
03:49:49.490 --> 03:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
into a law enforcement officer but if
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
they were following all the laws and
 
03:49:52.969 --> 03:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
everything was going along as normal we
 
03:49:54.889 --> 03:49:54.899 align:start position:0%
would never know there'd be no way to to
 
03:49:55.969 --> 03:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
know I mean we'd have to get a
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
notification from Homeland Security in
 
03:49:59.630 --> 03:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
order to revoke that status
 
03:50:01.490 --> 03:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:03.410 --> 03:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
03:50:04.729 --> 03:50:04.739 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:50:04.739 --> 03:50:06.889 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

03:50:06.889 --> 03:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
is there any do we have any information
 
03:50:11.150 --> 03:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
of of
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
um what other states at what level of
 
03:50:18.170 --> 03:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
this phase one phase two what other
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
states are issuing uh real ID at what
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
particular time and do they have this
 
03:50:27.889 --> 03:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
this concern of issuing it those states
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
that have it
 
03:50:33.170 --> 03:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
after phase one if someone fails phase
 
03:50:36.889 --> 03:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
two and and the and the real ID is
 
03:50:39.530 --> 03:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
issued which is I I think somewhat
 
03:50:42.490 --> 03:50:42.500 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair's question
 
03:50:46.130 --> 03:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
what's the process that takes place in
 
03:50:47.410 --> 03:50:47.420 align:start position:0%
order to
 
03:50:51.469 --> 03:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
invalidate I would use the phrase that
 
03:50:53.570 --> 03:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
real ID at that point
 
03:50:54.889 --> 03:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question
 
03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um
 
03:50:59.150 --> 03:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
so that that is part of the ongoing
 
03:51:01.010 --> 03:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
research is to find out
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
um exactly what is taking place in other
 
03:51:05.929 --> 03:51:05.939 align:start position:0%
states I did ask John Mills from um from
 
03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
the federal government on the way over
 
03:51:10.490 --> 03:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
here how many states are uh simply
 
03:51:13.250 --> 03:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
have they migrated simply to the real ID
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
act and that's it whatever the real ID
 
03:51:17.210 --> 03:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
act says they do
 
03:51:19.130 --> 03:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
um he explained to me without giving me
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
an exact number that um it sounds like
 
03:51:23.090 --> 03:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
the majority of states are doing that
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
they are going by what's in the real ID
 
03:51:27.229 --> 03:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
act completely
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
um as far as those touch points go I did
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
ask those questions during the call that
 
03:51:33.889 --> 03:51:33.899 align:start position:0%
we had uh where where is that
 
03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
um and there really wasn't any strong
 
03:51:38.570 --> 03:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
firm information on it one thing I
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
failed to mention during my testimony
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
was at the DMV we used the save database
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
run by Homeland Security and that's
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
something that can be queried to
 
03:51:50.030 --> 03:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
identify is somebody have they after the
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
30 days and they've been uploaded into
 
03:51:53.450 --> 03:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
the save database they've been
 
03:51:55.190 --> 03:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
positively identified and we can see
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
that prior to that 30 days though
 
03:51:59.929 --> 03:51:59.939 align:start position:0%
um you know you've got the receipt and
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
some level of vetting and my
 
03:52:03.290 --> 03:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
understanding is they're not in a safe
 
03:52:05.690 --> 03:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
database until that 30 day Mark so
 
03:52:08.570 --> 03:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
you've got that that window there
 
03:52:10.729 --> 03:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
um so I think part of our our
 
03:52:13.309 --> 03:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility and a lot of a lot of
 
03:52:15.469 --> 03:52:15.479 align:start position:0%
conversations have been had on a variety
 
03:52:18.170 --> 03:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
of bills this one as well over the last
 
03:52:20.570 --> 03:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
couple of months but I think there's
 
03:52:22.190 --> 03:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
been more research done within the last
 
03:52:25.490 --> 03:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
48 hours getting ready for this hearing
 
03:52:27.410 --> 03:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
and dealing with a variety of bills to
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get it right that is a
 
03:52:30.650 --> 03:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
piece that we have to continue on which
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
is what are other states doing and to
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
what extent what are they looking at for
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
touch points but it sounds like a lot of
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
them based on what he told me
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
um a lot are just adopting the real ID
 
03:52:40.920 --> 03:52:43.250 align:start position:0%
um a lot are just adopting the real ID
Act

03:52:43.250 --> 03:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
Act
 
03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
03:52:49.309 --> 03:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up is part of that also the
 
03:52:51.250 --> 03:52:51.260 align:start position:0%
procedure for
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
failure at any of those levels the the
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
revocation or is that is that part of
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
that you're also looking for yes I'd
 
03:53:02.570 --> 03:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
like to know I'd like to know how many
 
03:53:06.769 --> 03:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
states purely default to the real ID act
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
and then how many states operate in a
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
hybrid uh much like we do where there
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
are certain aspects of the real ID act
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
that they abide by and some maybe that
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
they don't and then what some states do
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
with regards to touch points is it that
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
once you file that application and
 
03:53:26.330 --> 03:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's some level of vetting that takes
 
03:53:28.250 --> 03:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
place at that time and you get a receipt
 
03:53:30.349 --> 03:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
that your application's filed is that
 
03:53:34.010 --> 03:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
enough thank you thank you
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
03:53:40.190 --> 03:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:53:40.200 --> 03:53:41.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:43.010 --> 03:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
my question is actually a two-part
 
03:53:45.650 --> 03:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
question but first part is does New
 
03:53:49.090 --> 03:53:49.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh is New Hampshire able to
 
03:53:52.490 --> 03:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
issue regular licenses without the real
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
ID function uh Canon does New Hampshire
 
03:53:58.130 --> 03:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
do it
 
03:54:01.130 --> 03:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I mean currently uh we're at
 
03:54:04.670 --> 03:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
about 52 percent of the population that
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
has a real ID in New Hampshire so there
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
are still a lot of people in New
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that don't have the real ID of
 
03:54:11.330 --> 03:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
course I didn't explain that the real ID
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
the benefit of it it's a higher level
 
03:54:16.330 --> 03:54:16.340 align:start position:0%
credential that will allow you to travel
 
03:54:18.469 --> 03:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know through an airport and also
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
into Federal buildings so
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why uh you know there's a few
 
03:54:26.090 --> 03:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
more stipulations to the real follow-up
 
03:54:26.100 --> 03:54:27.110 align:start position:0%
more stipulations to the real follow-up
yeah

03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:54:27.120 --> 03:54:28.490 align:start position:0%
yeah
follow-up

03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:54:28.500 --> 03:54:29.210 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

03:54:29.210 --> 03:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:32.570 --> 03:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
for people seeking Asylum do they really
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
need to have the real ID function or
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
just an ordinary driver's license be
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh I guess it would be a preference but
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
the guarantee to have a credential here
 
03:54:47.150 --> 03:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
in the state would be a driver's license
 
03:54:49.250 --> 03:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
without the real ID attached to it
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
immediately they could always follow up
 
03:54:55.729 --> 03:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:00.410 --> 03:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:55:05.090 --> 03:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
um if that you issue a regular license
 
03:55:06.170 --> 03:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
to them
 
03:55:08.809 --> 03:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
and they fail the vetting process and
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
the Asylum request do you then have to
 
03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
revoke the regular license as well or
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
so what would that be the same process
 
03:55:15.720 --> 03:55:16.550 align:start position:0%
so what would that be the same process
that

03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
you would have to go through to revoke
 
03:55:20.929 --> 03:55:20.939 align:start position:0%
the real ID yes so yeah the process
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
would be we'd get a notification back
 
03:55:24.769 --> 03:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
from saves uh which tells us that they
 
03:55:27.170 --> 03:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
haven't passed the the informational
 
03:55:29.330 --> 03:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
background and we then revoke the
 
03:55:29.340 --> 03:55:33.490 align:start position:0%
background and we then revoke the
license

03:55:33.490 --> 03:55:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.250 --> 03:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Staub
 
03:55:41.990 --> 03:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:55:44.450 --> 03:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't have a real ID are
 
03:55:46.790 --> 03:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
they able to get on an airplane when
 
03:55:49.370 --> 03:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
does that stipulation go into effect
 
03:55:51.229 --> 03:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so that was just
 
03:55:53.090 --> 03:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
pushed out it was supposed to have been
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
with that I don't have any other pink
 
03:56:23.170 --> 03:56:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.689 --> 03:56:25.699 align:start position:0%
that was up there
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
up there the way up to hide up there all
 
03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:30.189 align:start position:0%
up there the way up to hide up there all
right

03:56:30.189 --> 03:56:30.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:56:33.950 --> 03:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes uh Eva Castillo who
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
supports the bill is looking for two
 
03:56:36.479 --> 03:56:38.630 align:start position:0%
supports the bill is looking for two
minutes

03:56:38.630 --> 03:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:56:42.590 --> 03:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:45.650 --> 03:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Eva Castillo I'm a
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
resident of Manchester and I'm immigrant
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
rights Advocate and as an immigrant
 
03:56:54.650 --> 03:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
myself as you can tell I may support of
 
03:56:57.290 --> 03:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it's a no-nonsense
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
bill if the feds uh accept and license
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
people certain categories so people I
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't see why we cannot extend the same
 
03:57:08.809 --> 03:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
courtesy in New Hampshire to the the
 
03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
people that are extended real like these
 
03:57:14.570 --> 03:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
under the the real ID act that's all I
 
03:57:18.050 --> 03:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
have to say be made life easier for a
 
03:57:20.450 --> 03:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
lot of people you know once it starts
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
acting out once it becomes mandatory how
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
people are going to be able to board
 
03:57:29.630 --> 03:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
planes or do whatever if they are not
 
03:57:29.640 --> 03:57:31.450 align:start position:0%
planes or do whatever if they are not
like

03:57:31.450 --> 03:57:31.460 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:57:34.729 --> 03:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a U.S citizen but all my
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
documents have different versions of my
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
name or combination so it's going to be
 
03:57:40.910 --> 03:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
a nightmare so I got myself a US
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
passport card that's easy for me to
 
03:57:46.010 --> 03:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
carry in my wallet but not you know
 
03:57:48.050 --> 03:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
different immigrant categories are not
 
03:57:51.170 --> 03:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
going to have that luxury so I think you
 
03:57:53.870 --> 03:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
know he said No Nonsense low and I look
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
forward to keep working with DMV and and
 
03:57:59.929 --> 03:57:59.939 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can make things happen
 
03:58:02.510 --> 03:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire thank you
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:58:04.560 --> 03:58:06.290 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

03:58:06.290 --> 03:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%

representing herself and asking for two
 
03:58:25.020 --> 03:58:26.689 align:start position:0%
representing herself and asking for two
minutes

03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:58:28.849 --> 03:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Walsh and
 
03:58:31.370 --> 03:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm a resident
 
03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
of Derry I'm also a member of the New
 
03:58:34.849 --> 03:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immigrants rights Network and
 
03:58:38.030 --> 03:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
I sent a letter last night by email to
 
03:58:40.729 --> 03:58:40.739 align:start position:0%
all of you about our position on this
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
bill and I just want to make a few
 
03:58:46.610 --> 03:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
points um attorney beesnet and Eva
 
03:58:49.550 --> 03:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
Castillo covered many of the points one
 
03:58:52.269 --> 03:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
one issue is that RSA
 
03:58:52.279 --> 03:58:53.830 align:start position:0%
one issue is that RSA
2663

03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
2663
 
03:58:57.650 --> 03:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
14-b is the statute that permits the
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
issue issuance of real ID level licenses
 
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if you read that Laura
 
03:59:05.929 --> 03:59:05.939 align:start position:0%
as I did I read it to believe that it
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
only applied to that only U.S citizens
 
03:59:11.689 --> 03:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
are entitled to that under the current
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
law so that's really the impetus for um
 
03:59:19.490 --> 03:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
this legislation to allow the full list
 
03:59:22.370 --> 03:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
of folks eligible under federal law to
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
be able to apply for driver's licenses
 
03:59:27.490 --> 03:59:27.500 align:start position:0%
at the real ID level
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
the way we wrote it we put it into 263
 
03:59:35.210 --> 03:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
39a which is the one statute that covers
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
nine U.S citizens and Licensing in that
 
03:59:42.469 --> 03:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
body of Law and and it was really simply
 
03:59:45.170 --> 03:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
put in a way that we believe gives the
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
DMV quite a bit of discretion in how
 
03:59:50.469 --> 03:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
they carry this out it just simply adds
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
a clause that says that that um people
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
that are eligible under real ID are also
 
04:00:00.290 --> 04:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
eligible for a real ID license so
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
um we're asking for that same
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity and to limit it right now
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
apparently to only U.S citizens or
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
within the discretion of the DMV really
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
limits equal opportunity and access and
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
that that you know is is a problem in
 
04:00:17.170 --> 04:00:17.180 align:start position:0%
our opinion
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
we also
 
04:00:22.969 --> 04:00:22.979 align:start position:0%
um think that because full compliance
 
04:00:28.189 --> 04:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
with real ID is now may 2025 that means
 
04:00:30.769 --> 04:00:30.779 align:start position:0%
that the state although they might be in
 
04:00:33.410 --> 04:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
interim compliance may be out of
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
compliance on May 2025 if they don't
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
take actions to
 
04:00:38.520 --> 04:00:39.110 align:start position:0%
take actions to
um

04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:43.330 --> 04:00:43.340 align:start position:0%
open it up to the full Federal federally
 
04:00:47.150 --> 04:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
mandated group of people and we think
 
04:00:49.250 --> 04:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
that the way we
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
are presenting this this gives a DMV
 
04:00:53.809 --> 04:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to deal with the minutia
 
04:00:55.490 --> 04:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
in detail of how long you have to wait
 
04:00:57.710 --> 04:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
before you get a license it may be
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
longer for people to have pending
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
applications it's something that's
 
04:01:03.650 --> 04:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
already been approved so that the by
 
04:01:07.130 --> 04:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
regulation the DMV could make processes
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
that they could live with and that would
 
04:01:11.870 --> 04:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
be fair to the residents of the State of
 
04:01:13.070 --> 04:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I think that's all I
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
04:01:17.210 --> 04:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
04:01:18.650 --> 04:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:01:24.530 --> 04:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm not sure
 
04:01:26.269 --> 04:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I listened to the organization that
 
04:01:27.650 --> 04:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
you represent and I'm not sure I'm
 
04:01:29.570 --> 04:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
asking the right question to the right
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
person but I thought I'd throw it out so
 
04:01:34.250 --> 04:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
maybe uh director marasco could could
 
04:01:36.110 --> 04:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
hear it as well and add it to his list
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
of questions
 
04:01:41.210 --> 04:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other country that
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
allows this level of
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
citizenship I'll call it
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
um or or scrutiny on their Drive is
 
04:01:54.769 --> 04:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
um uh ID cards
 
04:01:57.290 --> 04:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
um that would if some is there something
 
04:02:00.290 --> 04:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
similar from Canada for instance or some
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
other that allows people pending
 
04:02:07.130 --> 04:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
um hearings to have
 
04:02:11.090 --> 04:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
um full or real ID type identification
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that I haven't really
 
04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
studied other countries laws the only
 
04:02:16.849 --> 04:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
remarks I'll make about it and probably
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
director marasco could be
 
04:02:22.490 --> 04:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
more on point to your question I would
 
04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
say that real ideas we all know is
 
04:02:28.130 --> 04:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
enacted the whole big Act was enacted
 
04:02:31.490 --> 04:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
after in the wake of 9 11 and it was to
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
make our country safer after this
 
04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
terrible catastrophe and loss of life so
 
04:02:40.010 --> 04:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
the feds have spent a lot of time
 
04:02:42.370 --> 04:02:42.380 align:start position:0%
um working with this
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
director marasco mentioned that they use
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
the save program so that the State DMV
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
can tell if I say that I'm a legal
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
permanent resident and you run my info
 
04:02:53.809 --> 04:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
through the system they'll be able to
 
04:02:56.210 --> 04:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
verify that generally I mean there are
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
some mistakes in the system but
 
04:02:58.250 --> 04:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
generally you're going to get an
 
04:03:00.889 --> 04:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
accurate feedback that will confirm so I
 
04:03:02.570 --> 04:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
think the state has done a quite a bit
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
to um to make sure that we're giving
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
licenses uh properly and with proper IDs
 
04:03:11.469 --> 04:03:11.479 align:start position:0%
but this is based on federal law that's
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
lawmakers have spent a lot of time
 
04:03:14.760 --> 04:03:15.349 align:start position:0%
lawmakers have spent a lot of time
um

04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:19.070 --> 04:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
betting and making secure so I I think
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's reliable and I think the
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
United States may have higher standards
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
than many other states I would think
 
04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
Canada might have similar but they
 
04:03:27.530 --> 04:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
didn't suffer what we suffered with 9
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
11. so I think that's the root of this
 
04:03:30.600 --> 04:03:31.490 align:start position:0%
11. so I think that's the root of this
law

04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:03:33.729 --> 04:03:33.739 align:start position:0%
and yet they still recognize that
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
non-citizens are entitled to you know
 
04:03:39.170 --> 04:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
equal access to a certain level of of
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.030 --> 04:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
04:03:51.229 --> 04:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:03:53.229 --> 04:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the law here and it says
 
04:03:56.330 --> 04:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
driver's license to a non-resident alien
 
04:03:58.729 --> 04:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
who is living in New Hampshire on a
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
temporary basis
 
04:04:02.809 --> 04:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
so you think that someone's only living
 
04:04:06.769 --> 04:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
here temporary we should issue a real ID
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
well it's not it's not what I think it's
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
what the federal law says the that list
 
04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
um is in it's I I have it attached to
 
04:04:17.450 --> 04:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
the letter we sent and um I think Jill
 
04:04:19.250 --> 04:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
will have it in his um his written
 
04:04:20.750 --> 04:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
testimony as well
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
it has a list of who the federal
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
government says can get a federally
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
approved real ID license those are the
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
folks that they say are vetted to get
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
that I mean there's vetting that has to
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
be done at at the desk at the DMV but
 
04:04:38.450 --> 04:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
those categories of people if you can
 
04:04:40.849 --> 04:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
verify that I am who I say I am I am a
 
04:04:42.670 --> 04:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
U.S citizen I am a temporary resident
 
04:04:44.809 --> 04:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
but there's plenty of people that come
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
into the United States they may start
 
04:04:48.769 --> 04:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
out temporary they may end up on the set
 
04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
pass to citizenship they may be here to
 
04:04:53.150 --> 04:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
study and and they'll leave but they can
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
get certain level of driver's license
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
and the list that we've I don't know if
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
anybody has a hard copy of of the the
 
04:05:03.410 --> 04:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
letter I sent last night but the last
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
page of it has the list of everybody
 
04:05:08.570 --> 04:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
that the U.S government says can get a
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
real ID level license now how you come
 
04:05:14.450 --> 04:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
to that is what we left open to the DMV
 
04:05:17.150 --> 04:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
what the processes they need to do to

04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
representing herself who supports the
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
bill who's asking for one minute
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
04:05:55.969 --> 04:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Viola katsume
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to speak on my personal
 
04:06:00.530 --> 04:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
experience uh in 2020 when my driver's
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
license was up for Renewal
 
04:06:04.150 --> 04:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
um I went to the
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
DMV website and looked up the again just
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I had the right
 
04:06:11.210 --> 04:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
documents before I went to the office uh
 
04:06:13.610 --> 04:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
and upon looking at the website I saw
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
information about real ID uh clicking on
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
that I got information about who
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
qualified in New Hampshire and it
 
04:06:22.610 --> 04:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
referenced the federal requirements for
 
04:06:24.410 --> 04:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
the real ID on that website so I opened
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
up the further requirements and
 
04:06:29.210 --> 04:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
surprisingly I was among the people that
 
04:06:31.010 --> 04:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
qualified for real ID
 
04:06:34.370 --> 04:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
um so I called the DMV app and I said I
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for real ID what do I need to
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
bring and it was shortly told that I
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify because I wasn't a
 
04:06:44.210 --> 04:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
citizen and so when I went to the DMV
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
office for Renewal I did inquire again
 
04:06:49.010 --> 04:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
at the front desk to make sure that I
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
had the right information and I was told
 
04:06:53.570 --> 04:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
the same thing um and I made sure to
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
cite the fact that the federal
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
government guidelines allow me to have a
 
04:07:00.769 --> 04:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
real ID driver's license and I was told
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
the same thing that I had to be a
 
04:07:05.090 --> 04:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
citizen to qualify in New Hampshire and
 
04:07:06.650 --> 04:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really make sense I have
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
gone through that process I have been
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
varied I've been living here legally
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
working here contributing
 
04:07:14.809 --> 04:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
um and I don't see a reason why I should
 
04:07:18.110 --> 04:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
be excluded or other people like me and
 
04:07:19.849 --> 04:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
I'm someone who travels for leisure but
 
04:07:21.769 --> 04:07:21.779 align:start position:0%
also for work I don't want to be driving
 
04:07:25.070 --> 04:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
around my past wherever I go and so I'm
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
just asking that this committee
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
considers that people that are here that
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
are legally vetted have gone through
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
that process already and one other thing
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
if you offered a driver's license it's
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
attached to your status so someone who's
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
still here temporarily for two years
 
04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
their driver's license will be here for
 
04:07:44.330 --> 04:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
two years maybe two years and three
 
04:07:45.490 --> 04:07:45.500 align:start position:0%
months until
 
04:07:48.349 --> 04:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
they check out of the country so they're
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
not here the the driver's license is not
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
here different from the time time that
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
your legal started the length of your
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
legal status bicycle is what I'm trying
 
04:07:59.929 --> 04:07:59.939 align:start position:0%
to say so I hope that this committee
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
will consider that and so that again so
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
that we are the same we're treated
 
04:08:07.250 --> 04:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
equally and also that New Hampshire has
 
04:08:08.809 --> 04:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
the same law as the federal governments
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
why do we have to have two laws in the
 
04:08:13.130 --> 04:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
state so thank you for your time and
 
04:08:16.729 --> 04:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
please consider this bill
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:08:24.650 --> 04:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%

04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%

04:08:35.689 --> 04:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
our next bill we'll be talking up in a
 
04:12:07.849 --> 04:12:07.859 align:start position:0%

thank you okay it's uh 140 here and I
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%

committee executing bills

was before this committee last year
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
and includes the amendment that was
 
04:12:54.110 --> 04:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
considered by the committee at that time
 
04:12:56.570 --> 04:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
after being sent to interim study this
 
04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
committee voted to recommend it for

future legislation
 
04:13:03.889 --> 04:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
this bill will amend RSA 263 colon 35
 
04:13:06.110 --> 04:13:06.120 align:start position:0%

licenses to an in-state driver's license
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
to add additional reporting requirements
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
if a person's circumstances change
 
04:13:18.170 --> 04:13:18.180 align:start position:0%

driver's licenses at the polls if they
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
failed to do so so this bill is a
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the letter
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%

in this letter they reported that dismal
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
84.5 percent unexplained non-compliance
 
04:13:46.010 --> 04:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
rate with the driver's license transfer
 
04:13:48.290 --> 04:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%

04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
we have addressed that they've addressed
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
all the implementation concerns with
 
04:14:07.010 --> 04:14:07.020 align:start position:0%

04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
and um I passed out some written
 
04:14:12.490 --> 04:14:12.500 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe that was also sent
 
04:14:15.650 --> 04:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
electronically and I'll be glad to
 
04:14:18.110 --> 04:14:18.120 align:start position:0%

04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
04:14:28.969 --> 04:14:28.979 align:start position:0%
thank you one question I may have missed
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
it in a testimony if somebody does leave
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
the state and they just re don't you
 
04:14:36.290 --> 04:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
know do what they're being asked to do
 
04:14:38.929 --> 04:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
what are the repercussions if any
 
04:14:38.939 --> 04:14:39.889 align:start position:0%
what are the repercussions if any
um

04:14:39.889 --> 04:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
I mean in effect there isn't much of any
 
04:14:46.010 --> 04:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
I mean it it does say there's if they
 
04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
leave the state within the 60 days
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to notify
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
um the DMV
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
um at least that provides an opportunity
 
04:14:55.610 --> 04:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
that if they leave in that time
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
there can be a notification
 
04:14:59.809 --> 04:14:59.819 align:start position:0%
um I suppose if they end up back in New
 
04:15:01.610 --> 04:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they're I mean really in
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%

04:15:37.610 --> 04:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'm from the New Hampshire DMV and I'm
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
here to speak on behalf of house bill
 
04:15:39.120 --> 04:15:40.910 align:start position:0%
here to speak on behalf of house bill
198.

04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
198.
 
04:15:40.920 --> 04:15:43.070 align:start position:0%
198.
um

04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:45.610 --> 04:15:45.620 align:start position:0%
this bill kind of brings into question
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
what the representative was talking
 
04:15:49.490 --> 04:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
04:15:49.500 --> 04:15:50.090 align:start position:0%
about earlier
um

04:15:50.090 --> 04:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
is it refined is there anything that
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
would happen to anybody who's going to
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.479 --> 04:15:59.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:01.490 --> 04:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
right now the DMV has no way of tracking
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
individuals either entering the state
 
04:16:05.809 --> 04:16:05.819 align:start position:0%
unless they come to the DMV for a new
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
license or to register to vote and we
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
have no way of tracking if they leave
 
04:16:12.290 --> 04:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
the state if they're here for that
 
04:16:15.170 --> 04:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
specific time of the bill between the
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
first day and 60 days and they decide to
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
leave the state it's saying that they
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
have to notify the director
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh of their leaving the state
 
04:16:22.800 --> 04:16:24.530 align:start position:0%
uh of their leaving the state
I

04:16:24.530 --> 04:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
I moved to Florida I
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
I didn't notify the state that I was
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
leaving but they were notified that when
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
I applied for my Florida driver's
 
04:16:32.520 --> 04:16:33.889 align:start position:0%
I applied for my Florida driver's
license

04:16:33.889 --> 04:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:16:35.450 --> 04:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
um that I established residency there
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
and they canceled my New Hampshire
 
04:16:36.600 --> 04:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
and they canceled my New Hampshire
license

04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
there was no penalty at that point for
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
that so I don't I don't know who's going
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
to manage this I don't know how we're
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
going to set up a system to either track
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
people coming into the state or people
 
04:16:49.610 --> 04:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
leaving the state and it's really all I
 
04:16:52.969 --> 04:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm open to any questions
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:16:57.410 --> 04:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:17:01.130 --> 04:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question the process that you
 
04:17:03.530 --> 04:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
went through when you went to Florida
 
04:17:07.370 --> 04:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
um is that are you a uniform process
 
04:17:09.650 --> 04:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
that would take place in all states or
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
is that just what Florida decided to do
 
04:17:15.650 --> 04:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
or is how how is so that's that's
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
uniform throughout the states uh right
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
now the all the states are going through
 
04:17:20.929 --> 04:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
What's called the state to state process
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically a one credential in
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
one state so anytime anybody moves to
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
Florida Nevada wherever they're going uh
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
if they go to register for a motor
 
04:17:33.410 --> 04:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
vehicle or for a driver's license at
 
04:17:36.410 --> 04:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
that point uh the state will send back
 
04:17:38.689 --> 04:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
um electronic communications to the
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
state to state system and notify New
 
04:17:43.849 --> 04:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that there's now uh Novell
 
04:17:45.530 --> 04:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
license for the person that moved from
 
04:17:47.689 --> 04:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to Nevada that they've
 
04:17:50.210 --> 04:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
canceled their New Hampshire license
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up follow-up thank you
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
um is that strictly for
 
04:18:00.410 --> 04:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
DMV or does that also get shared with
 
04:18:01.969 --> 04:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State
 
04:18:04.010 --> 04:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
so that's that's right now I know it's
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
strictly for DMV
 
04:18:07.790 --> 04:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
um but there's a notification that the
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
DMV does uh every day at two o'clock in
 
04:18:12.170 --> 04:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
the morning we send all the information
 
04:18:14.090 --> 04:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
to the Department of State letting them
 
04:18:14.100 --> 04:18:15.170 align:start position:0%
to the Department of State letting them
know

04:18:15.170 --> 04:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:18:17.330 --> 04:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
um the most recent uh residents are here
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:24.050 --> 04:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair no
 
04:18:26.090 --> 04:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
he did it for you
 
04:18:29.090 --> 04:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:18:36.889 --> 04:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mercier
 
04:18:36.899 --> 04:18:37.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Mercier
um

04:18:37.610 --> 04:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:40.370 --> 04:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
did I understand you correctly that at
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
two o'clock every morning I guess you
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
meant two o'clock in the morning
 
04:18:48.290 --> 04:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
that the DMV is sharing information with
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire secretary of state
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
currently that's correct
 
04:18:56.210 --> 04:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
how does the sharing of that follow-up
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
please follow up
 
04:19:02.809 --> 04:19:02.819 align:start position:0%
how does this bill improve or negate
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:09.359 --> 04:19:10.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:19:10.729 --> 04:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
I guess as a current practice would be
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
it would negate it or improve it
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a notification that you know
 
04:19:22.610 --> 04:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
we say for example we have 10 new 10 new
 
04:19:23.929 --> 04:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
residents come in and register for their
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
that gives their name address where they
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
currently are residing at and that'll
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
put them I guess with the whatever
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
District they're going to be voting in
 
04:19:36.910 --> 04:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
so when they go to register to vote
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
they'll uh they'll have a
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
establish identity already here in New
 
04:19:41.520 --> 04:19:45.650 align:start position:0%
establish identity already here in New
Hampshire

04:19:45.650 --> 04:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.170 --> 04:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much chairman uh the
 
04:19:52.969 --> 04:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
question I have is
 
04:19:55.490 --> 04:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
um does the Secretary of State provide
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
the DMV with information on people who
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
have registered to vote using an
 
04:20:02.929 --> 04:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
out-of-state license and what do they do
 
04:20:04.849 --> 04:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
with it that's a great question
 
04:20:06.769 --> 04:20:06.779 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't know the answer to
 
04:20:08.210 --> 04:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
that but I can definitely get that
 
04:20:10.370 --> 04:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
answered to you when I found out from
 
04:20:14.570 --> 04:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.150 --> 04:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
the question I have is you you kind of
 
04:20:19.490 --> 04:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
like asked a question like if this bill
 
04:20:19.500 --> 04:20:20.510 align:start position:0%
like asked a question like if this bill
passed

04:20:20.510 --> 04:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:20:23.090 --> 04:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
who's going to manage this I mean if if
 
04:20:24.410 --> 04:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's the case I guess I'll throw it
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
back at you who
 
04:20:28.849 --> 04:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
would manage this process
 
04:20:30.650 --> 04:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I I don't know
 
04:20:32.090 --> 04:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
who would manage that process I don't
 
04:20:36.530 --> 04:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
know how we could establish a link
 
04:20:39.530 --> 04:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
to inform us that somebody's moving into
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%

04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
care to speak to motion
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I just don't think a committed a
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
study committee is necessary on this I
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
think the landlords will actually
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
eventually realize they need to put
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
charging stations at one point in time
 
04:40:37.610 --> 04:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
04:40:41.390 --> 04:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:40:41.400 --> 04:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
so

04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:45.170 --> 04:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of pushback about
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
study committees study commissions Etc
 
04:40:50.630 --> 04:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
but you know what sometimes things
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
should be studied
 
04:40:52.920 --> 04:40:54.010 align:start position:0%
should be studied
um

04:40:54.010 --> 04:40:54.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of what I'll call
 
04:40:58.970 --> 04:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
misinformation out there about vehicle
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure and how that
 
04:41:03.410 --> 04:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
works and how it should work
 
04:41:05.830 --> 04:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
and there's some
 
04:41:10.990 --> 04:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
need in my mind to provide
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to move into
 
04:41:16.250 --> 04:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings and have be able to
 
04:41:18.530 --> 04:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
bring their electric car with them I've
 
04:41:23.150 --> 04:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
heard from several people uh
 
04:41:26.448 --> 04:41:26.458 align:start position:0%
who are needing to move because their
 
04:41:28.610 --> 04:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
apartment their old apartment building
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
is being the rent's going up so much
 
04:41:34.128 --> 04:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
that they can't afford to live there so
 
04:41:35.530 --> 04:41:35.540 align:start position:0%
they're trying to move to another place
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
and they want to bring their electric
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
vehicle with them but there is no
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the in many of the
 
04:41:43.850 --> 04:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
places that
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
they look at so a study committee to get
 
04:41:52.490 --> 04:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
down to the correct details about
 
04:41:56.208 --> 04:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle infrastructure
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I think is prudent more and more
 
04:42:01.970 --> 04:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
people are living in apartments uh
 
04:42:04.610 --> 04:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
particularly younger generation if you
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
um people who study the demographics of
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
our state
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
those people who are moving in are
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
generally young professional don't
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
particularly want to own a house would
 
04:42:20.930 --> 04:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
prefer to rent they want to minimize
 
04:42:23.208 --> 04:42:23.218 align:start position:0%
their environmental impact by owning an
 
04:42:26.030 --> 04:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle and so why are we
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
putting roadblocks in their way why not
 
04:42:31.930 --> 04:42:31.940 align:start position:0%
understand that a commission could
 
04:42:35.090 --> 04:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
examine all of these issues from the
 
04:42:37.730 --> 04:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
lens of what are we doing as we move
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
forward as opposed to
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
some bad information that's out there so
 
04:42:44.570 --> 04:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
I would urge the committee to vote
 
04:42:50.090 --> 04:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:51.288 --> 04:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I I agree with representative
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
sellers comments about the market and
 
04:43:02.810 --> 04:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
and whatnot but at the same time I I
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
don't see where a study committee would
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
hurt on this because maybe through such
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
a committee there would be availability
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
made to landlords and stuff to see how
 
04:43:15.530 --> 04:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
they could do this and and and
 
04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
I hate to use the word educate them but
 
04:43:18.890 --> 04:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
you know just show them the way that
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
this would be a good thing for them and
 
04:43:22.610 --> 04:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some funding or grants out
 
04:43:24.530 --> 04:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
there that would help them uh with any
 
04:43:27.410 --> 04:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
added costs for this so that's all thank
 
04:43:27.420 --> 04:43:28.850 align:start position:0%
added costs for this so that's all thank
you

04:43:28.850 --> 04:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:43:31.730 --> 04:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
04:43:35.090 --> 04:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
I wasn't really going to speak more on
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
this but uh it just that will happen my
 
04:43:39.288 --> 04:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
son actually lives down in New York City
 
04:43:41.090 --> 04:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
and he was actually working for a
 
04:43:43.090 --> 04:43:43.100 align:start position:0%
landlord who owned a thousand apartments
 
04:43:46.368 --> 04:43:46.378 align:start position:0%
and he was actually uh putting in
 
04:43:48.410 --> 04:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
charging stations so they're they're
 
04:43:50.570 --> 04:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
realizing they need to be done it's just
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
take them a little bit longer to do it
 
04:43:52.560 --> 04:43:54.288 align:start position:0%
take them a little bit longer to do it
so

04:43:54.288 --> 04:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:57.170 --> 04:43:57.180 align:start position:0%

uh we will exec House Bill 132 relative
 
04:46:26.930 --> 04:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
to Tire disclosure for resale of
 
04:46:29.930 --> 04:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
trailers by utility dealers chair
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Hill
 
04:46:36.830 --> 04:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chair thank you I would uh
 
04:46:41.150 --> 04:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
I would move itl on House Bill 132.
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Gorski would
 
04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
you care to speak to your emotion
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh certainly Mr chair
 
04:46:52.680 --> 04:46:53.390 align:start position:0%
uh certainly Mr chair
um

04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
while I have sympathy for the uh the
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors and their troubles on the
 
04:47:01.970 --> 04:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
roadside with a with a used tire they
 
04:47:04.368 --> 04:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
bought from a used trailer I'm not sure
 
04:47:06.530 --> 04:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
their solution of a
 
04:47:06.540 --> 04:47:07.550 align:start position:0%
their solution of a
um

04:47:07.550 --> 04:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
of a disclosure from the dealer is the
 
04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate solution
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
um I already there's a number of forms
 
04:47:18.770 --> 04:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
and papers that get passed with buying
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
used vehicles but I would suspect
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
um it it might be better to just have a
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh an independence inspection whenever
 
04:47:30.650 --> 04:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
you buy anything used including Tires
 
04:47:32.810 --> 04:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
and Brakes so that would be my
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion and uh for that reason I
 
04:47:40.490 --> 04:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
suggest an itl on House Bill 132.
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else from the
 
04:47:42.360 --> 04:47:45.410 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else from the
committee

04:47:45.410 --> 04:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
I just want to I I asked representative
 
04:47:52.368 --> 04:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
Hill about
 
04:47:54.288 --> 04:47:54.298 align:start position:0%
a couple of things and one one idea I
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
had which I think I mentioned the day of
 
04:47:59.690 --> 04:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
testimony was to have manufacturers put
 
04:48:01.610 --> 04:48:01.620 align:start position:0%
not just the code but the actual date
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
that the tires were were made and uh he
 
04:48:06.890 --> 04:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me that that would be
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
kind of tough to do
 
04:48:10.730 --> 04:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
in this room to get to make
 
04:48:12.970 --> 04:48:12.980 align:start position:0%
manufacturers do that
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I I have to agree with them about
 
04:48:17.520 --> 04:48:18.288 align:start position:0%
so I I have to agree with them about
um

04:48:18.288 --> 04:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:20.930 --> 04:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
that the buyers need to uh
 
04:48:22.730 --> 04:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
show enough you know
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
to have people check out the not only
 
04:48:26.330 --> 04:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
the person that's selling it or the
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
dealership but maybe have that

tires according to my written my notes
 
04:48:42.650 --> 04:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
written down the tires already do have a
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
date on them it's not it's not a month
 
04:48:48.530 --> 04:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
day and year but it's week in year so I
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
mean the information is already on the
 
04:48:52.128 --> 04:48:52.138 align:start position:0%

relative to their uh
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
purchase however I'm oftentimes and in
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
this case particularly uh reluctant to
 
04:49:19.610 --> 04:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
make law based on what at this point has
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
presented to us as a one-off
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
type situation now there probably are
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
other examples but no testimony led us
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
to to learn that so I I'm I will be
 
04:49:33.970 --> 04:49:33.980 align:start position:0%

actually have two amendments on it and
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's agreed that I think we can probably
 
04:52:05.330 --> 04:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
make a third one that solves everything
 
04:52:10.128 --> 04:52:10.138 align:start position:0%
so I'll reschedule house bill 153.

for a motion
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I motion this ought to pass
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:27.708 --> 04:53:27.718 align:start position:0%
who was that I said come up I saw
 
04:53:30.170 --> 04:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo uh would you care
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
to speak to motion sure basically Mr
 
04:53:34.730 --> 04:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
chair this is just a a housekeeping
 
04:53:37.070 --> 04:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
adding in space force and a few other
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
medals that were um
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
that veterans actually that earn the
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
medals can actually apply for to have
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
that decal uh after talking to the I
 
04:53:49.208 --> 04:53:49.218 align:start position:0%
believe it was the agent General there
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
the cost of this over a long period of
 
04:53:54.610 --> 04:53:54.620 align:start position:0%
time is going to be very very minimal
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
just because
 
04:53:58.970 --> 04:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
some Bedford some veterans very prideful
 
04:54:01.128 --> 04:54:01.138 align:start position:0%
and they won't get the detail and others
 
04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
that will actually want it a firearm a
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:08.690 --> 04:54:08.700 align:start position:0%

29 now emitted
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
no it's moved unchanged no amendments to
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
remove those 21-29 we would need an
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to do so so it's moving on and
 
04:54:29.570 --> 04:54:29.580 align:start position:0%

05:00:23.410 --> 05:00:23.420 align:start position:0%
to pass this committee passed the house
 
05:00:25.550 --> 05:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
died in the senate for some reason
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
taking another swing at it
 
05:00:34.128 --> 05:00:34.138 align:start position:0%
um yeah so uh Paul is a dedicated
 
05:00:36.530 --> 05:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
member of the general court and if you
 
05:00:38.448 --> 05:00:38.458 align:start position:0%
want to know how much he loves the house
 
05:00:40.010 --> 05:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
and you have a spare couple of hours
 
05:00:43.430 --> 05:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
so uh this is harmless costs nothing and
 
05:00:47.930 --> 05:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
I hope my colleagues can support the
 
05:00:47.940 --> 05:00:49.208 align:start position:0%
I hope my colleagues can support the
amendment

05:00:49.208 --> 05:00:49.218 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:00:51.470 --> 05:00:51.480 align:start position:0%

05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
does this amendment eliminate the plates

for the Liquor Commission
 
05:01:08.330 --> 05:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
no if you look at the way it's written
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
it says amend the bill by inserting it
 
05:01:11.810 --> 05:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
to section one the following and
 
05:01:13.850 --> 05:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
renumbering the original section two to
 
05:01:16.610 --> 05:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
read is three so structurally the way it
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
works is everything that's currently in
 
05:01:20.208 --> 05:01:20.218 align:start position:0%
the bill stays and it's just added to it
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
with a renumbering
 
05:01:24.890 --> 05:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
does the amendment need to be seconded
 
05:01:26.510 --> 05:01:26.520 align:start position:0%

um Mr chairman just uh reading a bill

and listening to testimony
 
05:04:14.810 --> 05:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
one of the first things I I have I
 
05:04:16.850 --> 05:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
wrestle with is the first hurdle which
 
05:04:16.860 --> 05:04:18.470 align:start position:0%
wrestle with is the first hurdle which
is

05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:04:20.150 --> 05:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
um someone who is illegal in this
 
05:04:22.730 --> 05:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
country getting access to a driver's
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
license I view a driver's license as a
 
05:04:29.690 --> 05:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
privilege which should be for legal
 
05:04:29.700 --> 05:04:30.850 align:start position:0%
privilege which should be for legal
citizens

05:04:30.850 --> 05:04:30.860 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
the other issue I have with the bill is
 
05:04:34.550 --> 05:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
the whole thing about privacy that in
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
fact if someone does get
 
05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
um you know stopped or
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
in some way have to show ID if in fact
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
they are shown to be here illegally
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to share their
 
05:04:51.050 --> 05:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
information we have enough for people
 
05:04:53.390 --> 05:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
here in a state that we don't really
 
05:04:55.970 --> 05:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
know how many people we have
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so I that are here illegally So based
 
05:05:01.128 --> 05:05:01.138 align:start position:0%
on all that I have
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
um an issue with this bill and that's
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
why I recommend itl
 
05:05:07.010 --> 05:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else from the
 
05:05:07.020 --> 05:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else from the
committee

05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
05:05:14.930 --> 05:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
somehow someway this Bill gets tagged
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
with a lot of things that it isn't and a
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
lot of things that it is get lost
 
05:05:31.010 --> 05:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I want to try and refocus
 
05:05:32.810 --> 05:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
everybody's attention on the fact that
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the first and foremost this is a
 
05:05:37.490 --> 05:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
bill about Public Safety
 
05:05:40.010 --> 05:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
and I say that because
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
in now 20 jurisdictions throughout the
 
05:05:46.368 --> 05:05:46.378 align:start position:0%
United States
 
05:05:50.448 --> 05:05:50.458 align:start position:0%
um a version of this bill has passed a
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
version of this bill has gone to a a
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
vote by the public to either deny or
 
05:06:01.570 --> 05:06:01.580 align:start position:0%
approve such a bill and the public
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly voted in favor of this
 
05:06:07.850 --> 05:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
bill in past testimonies before this
 
05:06:07.860 --> 05:06:09.410 align:start position:0%
bill in past testimonies before this
committee

05:06:09.410 --> 05:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
the chiefs of police and specific police
 
05:06:17.390 --> 05:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
Chiefs had suggested that this was a
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
good tool for police departments and the
 
05:06:22.690 --> 05:06:22.700 align:start position:0%
reason for that for them saying that is
 
05:06:26.810 --> 05:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
they want in their very best efforts to
 
05:06:29.208 --> 05:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
make connections with all members of
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
their community
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's called community policing
 
05:06:38.030 --> 05:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
this will help them make connections
 
05:06:40.250 --> 05:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
with a segment of the population that
 
05:06:42.650 --> 05:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
whether we want to acknowledge it or not
 
05:06:46.010 --> 05:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
those folks are living here in New
 
05:06:46.020 --> 05:06:46.910 align:start position:0%
those folks are living here in New
Hampshire

05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:06:49.730 --> 05:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
the total numbers unknown probably
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere is around 15 000 people
 
05:06:55.550 --> 05:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
those folks are
 
05:06:57.650 --> 05:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
living here
 
05:07:00.050 --> 05:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
paying taxes
 
05:07:03.310 --> 05:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
they are providing for their families
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
and in a state that is as challenged as
 
05:07:08.448 --> 05:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
this one in terms of public
 
05:07:08.458 --> 05:07:09.890 align:start position:0%
this one in terms of public
transportation

05:07:09.890 --> 05:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
05:07:14.208 --> 05:07:14.218 align:start position:0%
they end up sadly driving anyways
 
05:07:17.690 --> 05:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
or from my money I would much rather
 
05:07:20.030 --> 05:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
have a person
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a legal route to
 
05:07:25.368 --> 05:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
take a written exam
 
05:07:26.810 --> 05:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
take a
 
05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
practical exam
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
and demonstrate several very important
 
05:07:34.850 --> 05:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
points not least of which is that they
 
05:07:37.368 --> 05:07:37.378 align:start position:0%
can actually drive and know how to drive
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
and on top of that it will also help
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
identify who they are where they live
 
05:07:47.570 --> 05:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
those are important considerations in
 
05:07:49.850 --> 05:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
our fluid Society now
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.700 --> 05:08:01.368 align:start position:0%
 
will

05:08:01.368 --> 05:08:01.378 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:08:01.378 --> 05:08:02.208 align:start position:0%
will
um

05:08:02.208 --> 05:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:02.218 --> 05:08:05.288 align:start position:0%
um
help

05:08:05.288 --> 05:08:05.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.368 --> 05:08:10.378 align:start position:0%
us get to a a place where the people who
 
05:08:12.490 --> 05:08:12.500 align:start position:0%
are here anyways
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
can fit in better
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
not doing this is not going to cause
 
05:08:20.030 --> 05:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
those persons to go away they're still
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
going to be here
 
05:08:25.208 --> 05:08:25.218 align:start position:0%
not doing this is not going to fix any
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
problems and I'm just going to tell the
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
story I've told it before and I'm going
 
05:08:31.730 --> 05:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
to tell it again
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
when asked by my wife to her grandfather
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
what he did for a living he was a state
 
05:08:36.718 --> 05:08:37.850 align:start position:0%
what he did for a living he was a state
senator

05:08:37.850 --> 05:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
senator
 
05:08:39.530 --> 05:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
he said well I listen to people's
 
05:08:41.930 --> 05:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
problems and I try and fix them
 
05:08:44.930 --> 05:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
well I think that's incumbent upon us as
 
05:08:48.350 --> 05:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
well I think every one of us here can
 
05:08:50.750 --> 05:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
agree that the immigration system in
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
this country is broken
 
05:08:55.368 --> 05:08:55.378 align:start position:0%
it's not doing what it should do
 
05:08:57.530 --> 05:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
but we have an obligation as
 
05:09:00.350 --> 05:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
representatives to tackle those
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
difficult issues
 
05:09:04.850 --> 05:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
that are given to us to be responsible
 
05:09:08.570 --> 05:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
for driver's licensure is not a federal
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
issue it is a state issue we should be
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
tackling this trying to make
 
05:09:19.850 --> 05:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
our state our families and other folks
 
05:09:22.610 --> 05:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
as well safer because we have
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that they are who they are
 
05:09:27.170 --> 05:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
who they live where they say they live
 
05:09:28.788 --> 05:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
05:09:33.050 --> 05:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
been tested to prove that they can drive
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
on top of that it will give them the
 
05:09:39.530 --> 05:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to register a car and get
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
insurance which is also very important
 
05:09:44.448 --> 05:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
piece of this as well I think it is a
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
disservice to folks who would not be
 
05:09:50.930 --> 05:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
eligible for this license to not support
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and I I think that's I just I
 
05:09:56.160 --> 05:09:57.170 align:start position:0%
this bill and I I think that's I just I
just

05:09:57.170 --> 05:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:10:00.170 --> 05:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
ask that you open your hearts and look
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
to to to try and help
 
05:10:05.570 --> 05:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
everyone in this state and the best
 
05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:12.050 --> 05:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for anybody
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
else from the committee representative
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
Sinclair thank you I just like the fact
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
that that this bill uh
 
05:10:21.890 --> 05:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
would make my life a little safer on the
 
05:10:24.050 --> 05:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
highways by having more people that are
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
out there
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
probably have taken a driver's test and
 
05:10:30.530 --> 05:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully know what they're doing and as
 
05:10:33.830 --> 05:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
as the last speaker said well more
 
05:10:35.930 --> 05:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
likely have insurance which will help me
 
05:10:37.970 --> 05:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
if I get in an accident with them thank
 
05:10:37.980 --> 05:10:41.570 align:start position:0%
if I get in an accident with them thank
you

05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:10:44.930 --> 05:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Jones
 
05:10:46.490 --> 05:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:10:46.500 --> 05:10:47.390 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:49.850 --> 05:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
as we all know driving isn't our right
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
it's a privilege and it's a privilege
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
that has to be earned
 
05:10:55.850 --> 05:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
05:10:57.948 --> 05:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
we're better off having people out there
 
05:10:59.570 --> 05:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
on the roads who have earned the
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
privilege to be there for safety reasons
 
05:11:02.520 --> 05:11:03.830 align:start position:0%
privilege to be there for safety reasons
Alone

05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
Alone
 
05:11:03.840 --> 05:11:04.910 align:start position:0%
Alone
um

05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
I know uh
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
deaths and accidents and pedestrian
 
05:11:11.470 --> 05:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
deaths are all up in in New Hampshire
 
05:11:14.690 --> 05:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
and this is another way to help make it
 
05:11:14.700 --> 05:11:15.590 align:start position:0%
and this is another way to help make it
safer

05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
safer
 
05:11:19.250 --> 05:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm going to be a
 
05:11:23.690 --> 05:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:25.550 --> 05:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
05:11:28.010 --> 05:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:11:29.930 --> 05:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
I I get we want everybody to have a
 
05:11:31.610 --> 05:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
license I get that but when you start
 
05:11:33.470 --> 05:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and you say
 
05:11:36.110 --> 05:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay the state police can have the
 
05:11:38.448 --> 05:11:38.458 align:start position:0%
information the sheriffs can have the
 
05:11:38.458 --> 05:11:39.310 align:start position:0%
information the sheriffs can have the
information

05:11:39.310 --> 05:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:11:42.250 --> 05:11:42.260 align:start position:0%
the Town Police can have the information
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
but the immigrations can't have the
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
information that's in the law they're
 
05:11:47.650 --> 05:11:47.660 align:start position:0%
saying they can't have the information
 
05:11:50.448 --> 05:11:50.458 align:start position:0%
the the other area in here too that that
 
05:11:52.850 --> 05:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
kind of points out to me is um
 
05:11:56.270 --> 05:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
let me just find it for one second
 
05:11:56.280 --> 05:11:57.830 align:start position:0%
let me just find it for one second
um

05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
is that for whatever reason I'm not sure
 
05:12:00.480 --> 05:12:01.368 align:start position:0%
is that for whatever reason I'm not sure
why

05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:12:04.190 --> 05:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
but the person that's applying for the
 
05:12:06.650 --> 05:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
license can also opt out as far as
 
05:12:08.448 --> 05:12:08.458 align:start position:0%
giving a Social Security number so they
 
05:12:09.230 --> 05:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a Social Security
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.850 --> 05:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
05:12:18.890 --> 05:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
so uh somebody stole my thunder about
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
the uh the privilege but it's worth
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
pointing out insurance is not required
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if anyone has done some
 
05:12:32.270 --> 05:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
sort of statistical analysis of how many
 
05:12:34.190 --> 05:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
of these folks will go out and get the
 
05:12:35.810 --> 05:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
insurance because they're not required
 
05:12:35.820 --> 05:12:36.770 align:start position:0%
insurance because they're not required
to

05:12:36.770 --> 05:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
the safety argument so this bill's been
 
05:12:42.830 --> 05:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
a frequent flyer and I recall in past
 
05:12:45.650 --> 05:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
testimony hearing the lengths the folks
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
go through because they're afraid of
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
being pulled over
 
05:12:51.530 --> 05:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
walk arounds on their car making sure
 
05:12:53.330 --> 05:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
that all the equipment is correct and
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
working there was one gentleman a few
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
years ago who even testified that he
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
installed a mirror on a back wall of his
 
05:13:02.330 --> 05:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
garage so we could make sure his lights
 
05:13:03.650 --> 05:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
on the back of the car were working
 
05:13:05.330 --> 05:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
before he left
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
you know what I did this morning
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
while drinking coffee at my kitchen
 
05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
table I remote started my car and
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
eventually went outside made sure the
 
05:13:14.930 --> 05:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
tires weren't flat and I drove it two
 
05:13:16.550 --> 05:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
hours here
 
05:13:21.530 --> 05:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
who was safer so the safety argument I
 
05:13:23.330 --> 05:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you would prove it
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
either way but from the past testimony
 
05:13:27.530 --> 05:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
we've had on these bills they're far
 
05:13:30.288 --> 05:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
safer than I was today so I just I don't
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:35.650 --> 05:13:35.660 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
05:13:42.770 --> 05:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay I'll representative okay
 
05:13:44.330 --> 05:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
05:13:44.340 --> 05:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
um

05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:46.970 --> 05:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
the the part about
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
not sharing with immigration makes sense
 
05:13:51.770 --> 05:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
to me because it would defeat the entire
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill because nobody who
 
05:13:56.690 --> 05:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
has who who would be afraid of having
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
their information reported to
 
05:13:59.810 --> 05:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
immigration would want to get a license
 
05:14:02.690 --> 05:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
because and then you defeat the entire
 
05:14:05.090 --> 05:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
purpose of the you know the safety part
 
05:14:06.410 --> 05:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
um you you defeat the purpose of law
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
allowing law enforcement to have a valid
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
identification of a person that they can
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
look up in their system if they're
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
looking for somebody or trying to
 
05:14:18.850 --> 05:14:18.860 align:start position:0%
identify them on the side of the road
 
05:14:21.650 --> 05:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
they'd be afraid of stopping at an
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
accident still because they would be
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
afraid that their immigration status
 
05:14:26.690 --> 05:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
would be uh questioned during the during
 
05:14:28.610 --> 05:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
the stop so it doesn't add anything to
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
safety to to have this information
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
shared with immigration because then it
 
05:14:34.368 --> 05:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
would deter people that we're trying to
 
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
get to get licenses
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
from getting licenses so that's
 
05:14:39.718 --> 05:14:41.510 align:start position:0%
from getting licenses so that's
um

05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:43.128 --> 05:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
that's what I have
 
05:14:45.650 --> 05:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative Sykes
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I know that one of the things I
 
05:14:49.610 --> 05:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
forgot to mention
 
05:14:49.620 --> 05:14:50.570 align:start position:0%
forgot to mention
um

05:14:50.570 --> 05:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:54.170 --> 05:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about
 
05:14:57.170 --> 05:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
data from Connecticut Connecticut by the
 
05:14:59.390 --> 05:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
way is one of the many states that have
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
passed a similar Bill Connecticut has
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has Rhode Island has
 
05:15:07.368 --> 05:15:07.378 align:start position:0%
Vermont has New York has see a pattern
 
05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.910 --> 05:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
more importantly though in Connecticut
 
05:15:19.010 --> 05:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
when they passed a similar Bill like
 
05:15:19.020 --> 05:15:19.850 align:start position:0%
when they passed a similar Bill like
this

05:15:19.850 --> 05:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:15:22.550 --> 05:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
the next year their data for hit and run
 
05:15:26.330 --> 05:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle crashes went down
 
05:15:26.340 --> 05:15:28.430 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle crashes went down
significantly

05:15:28.430 --> 05:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
05:15:32.050 --> 05:15:32.060 align:start position:0%
and the belief was that it's because
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
undocumented persons who now had
 
05:15:36.830 --> 05:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses were staying instead
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
of fleeing
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.208 --> 05:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to add this I guess because
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen this bill three times now I
 
05:15:49.850 --> 05:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
think and it just doesn't
 
05:15:51.890 --> 05:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
make sense to me I think it's backwards
 
05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
now I know we just retained House Bill
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
650 which is trying to remove the
 
05:15:57.948 --> 05:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
privilege of driving
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
um the suspension of your license for
 
05:16:02.090 --> 05:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
not paying other fines and CR and
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
committing other crimes but right now
 
05:16:06.050 --> 05:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
currently in statute you can have your
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
license taken away for a myriad of
 
05:16:10.368 --> 05:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
things and there's even a bill going
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
through the Senate right now that's
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to include paying your fish and
 
05:16:15.470 --> 05:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
game uh rescue fees uh it's another
 
05:16:17.810 --> 05:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
reason you can lose your license so our
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
current laws across the book say that
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
the privilege of driving is fair game if
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
you break our laws now at our public
 
05:16:26.690 --> 05:16:26.700 align:start position:0%
hearings over and over and over I keep
 
05:16:29.868 --> 05:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
hearing some people saying that well
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
that they possibly broke a law to get
 
05:16:35.030 --> 05:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
here they're currently breaking the law
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
right now because they're driving anyway
 
05:16:38.930 --> 05:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
in spite of the fact that they're not
 
05:16:40.610 --> 05:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
supposed to if they don't have a Social
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
Security number I have to assume that
 
05:16:44.448 --> 05:16:44.458 align:start position:0%
they're working illegally so I don't
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
know how you can say you can look at one
 
05:16:48.288 --> 05:16:48.298 align:start position:0%
set of it and say we're going to take
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
your privilege but for these particular
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
lives we're going to give you that
 
05:16:54.410 --> 05:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
privilege makes no sense to me I'll be
 
05:16:56.810 --> 05:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'll ask the clerk to call the rule
 
05:17:00.070 --> 05:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
when she's ready
 
05:17:03.470 --> 05:17:03.480 align:start position:0%

House Bill 374
 
05:19:43.810 --> 05:19:43.820 align:start position:0%

okay
 
05:19:47.208 --> 05:19:47.218 align:start position:0%
would open up the executive session on
 
05:19:49.610 --> 05:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 375 relative to the licensure
 
05:19:51.410 --> 05:19:51.420 align:start position:0%

05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
HP 375
 
05:20:18.708 --> 05:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
um when testimony we had um
 
05:20:21.410 --> 05:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
some information shared about
 
05:20:21.420 --> 05:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
some information shared about
a

05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:20:26.930 --> 05:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
Asylum Seeker who was having some
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
difficulties in regards to
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
getting a license and although I can
 
05:20:38.750 --> 05:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
sympathize with that story that was
 
05:20:40.850 --> 05:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
provided to us in testimony one of the
 
05:20:42.890 --> 05:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
things that still troubled me
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
is that right now
 
05:20:48.530 --> 05:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
putting down Asylum status tends to be
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
kind of the default statement anybody
 
05:20:53.810 --> 05:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
who's coming in over the Border
 
05:20:55.970 --> 05:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
I would agree that there are some who
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
are definitely looking to get Asylum who
 
05:21:02.810 --> 05:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
are legitimate but we have far too many
 
05:21:05.090 --> 05:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
who fall in that category of falling
 
05:21:11.090 --> 05:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
into Asylum Seekers and with that and
 
05:21:14.510 --> 05:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
with the current immigration in status
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
at the border I just cannot support this
 
05:21:20.330 --> 05:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and that's why I am
 
05:21:23.810 --> 05:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
voting to uh for itl
 
05:21:27.410 --> 05:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.690 --> 05:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
05:21:33.470 --> 05:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:33.480 --> 05:21:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:21:35.810 --> 05:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:21:38.510 --> 05:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
as I explained in the public hearing
 
05:21:41.330 --> 05:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
that there was there are folks who
 
05:21:43.970 --> 05:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
legitimately seeking to enter the United
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
States uh they get here legally they
 
05:21:49.270 --> 05:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
apply for Asylum status
 
05:21:52.910 --> 05:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
they again legally
 
05:21:55.550 --> 05:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
they are told that if they live in New
 
05:21:57.288 --> 05:21:57.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they must get a driver's
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
license after 60 days and then in the
 
05:22:01.490 --> 05:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
very next breath they're told that they
 
05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
can't because they do not fulfill all
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements
 
05:22:05.760 --> 05:22:07.368 align:start position:0%
the requirements
um

05:22:07.368 --> 05:22:07.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:10.128 --> 05:22:10.138 align:start position:0%
one of which is to have either a work
 
05:22:10.138 --> 05:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
one of which is to have either a work
permit

05:22:11.350 --> 05:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
permit
 
05:22:11.360 --> 05:22:13.310 align:start position:0%
permit
now

05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
hearings for legitimate Asylum Seekers
 
05:22:20.930 --> 05:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
are years in the waiting
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the good news is that
 
05:22:25.128 --> 05:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
even the federal government recognizes
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's a problem there so
 
05:22:31.490 --> 05:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
how does one who is here legitimately
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
how does one provide for their family
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
well the feds say well after
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
365 days if you
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
have not had your hearing for Asylum
 
05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
then we will give you a work permit
 
05:22:52.310 --> 05:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then once you are in possession of
 
05:22:54.410 --> 05:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
that work permit you can go back to the
 
05:22:54.420 --> 05:22:55.610 align:start position:0%
that work permit you can go back to the
DMV

05:22:55.610 --> 05:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
DMV
 
05:22:57.170 --> 05:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
and up
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
take the test both the practice the
 
05:23:02.510 --> 05:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
written and the Practical exam and get
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
your driver's license this bill is
 
05:23:07.070 --> 05:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
nothing more than trying to close the
 
05:23:07.080 --> 05:23:07.910 align:start position:0%
nothing more than trying to close the
gap

05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
gap
 
05:23:11.448 --> 05:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
between when a person arrives when
 
05:23:13.368 --> 05:23:13.378 align:start position:0%
they're told they must get a driver's
 
05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
license and when they can actually get a
 
05:23:17.230 --> 05:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
I hear
 
05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
false complaining about all those quote
 
05:23:25.730 --> 05:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
unquote all those people who are coming
 
05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
into the United States and they're it's
 
05:23:29.810 --> 05:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
just a matter of form they apply for
 
05:23:32.330 --> 05:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
Asylum well I don't know where that data
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
came from but
 
05:23:33.958 --> 05:23:35.030 align:start position:0%
came from but
um

05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
I worry that we are punishing people who
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
are trying to say in many cases save
 
05:23:44.330 --> 05:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
their lives save the lives of their
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
family we get up and we have moments of
 
05:23:49.610 --> 05:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
silence for us people who are coming
 
05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
here to the United States from places
 
05:23:55.788 --> 05:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
like Ukraine and other countries where
 
05:23:57.770 --> 05:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely devastating
 
05:24:00.590 --> 05:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
conditions going on and those folks are
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
legitimately applying for Asylum and yet
 
05:24:04.850 --> 05:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
obtain one of the more necessary items
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
here in in this state because of the
 
05:24:13.128 --> 05:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
lack of public transportation
 
05:24:14.990 --> 05:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say it again and I'm
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
no some may feel that I'm being a broken
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
record but this is the right thing to do
 
05:24:23.570 --> 05:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we
 
05:24:25.490 --> 05:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
ought to do and we're trying to get the
 
05:24:25.500 --> 05:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
ought to do and we're trying to get the
language

05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:24:29.210 --> 05:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
perfect as we can
 
05:24:29.220 --> 05:24:30.410 align:start position:0%
perfect as we can
[Music]

05:24:30.410 --> 05:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I would urge my colleagues to vote in
 
05:24:36.770 --> 05:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill so that we can help
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
the people who have come here under very
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
difficult circumstances and who are
 
05:24:46.610 --> 05:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
I agree with you representative Sykes I
 
05:24:48.718 --> 05:24:49.610 align:start position:0%
I agree with you representative Sykes I
think

05:24:49.610 --> 05:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:24:51.770 --> 05:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
I think we are punishing well not us but
 
05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
I think the federal government's
 
05:24:55.730 --> 05:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
ignorant ignoring of the federal
 
05:24:58.010 --> 05:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
immigration laws is punishing a lot of
 
05:25:00.590 --> 05:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate asylees
 
05:25:02.448 --> 05:25:02.458 align:start position:0%
um and but the statistics you seek in
 
05:25:04.128 --> 05:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
terms of the percentages of people that
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
are just claiming Asylum because it's
 
05:25:08.628 --> 05:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
because they're seeking a better life uh
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
not not not fleeing from religious
 
05:25:13.970 --> 05:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
persecution or Wars Etc is out there and
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
I will provide it to you anybody else
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Hill
 
05:25:20.208 --> 05:25:20.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:25:23.030 --> 05:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
um my only comment is and I've and I've
 
05:25:25.190 --> 05:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
done the research and I have come up
 
05:25:25.200 --> 05:25:26.990 align:start position:0%
done the research and I have come up
blank

05:25:26.990 --> 05:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
blank
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
um if anyone could enlighten me any
 
05:25:33.170 --> 05:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
country in the world that would um
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
allow something similar
 
05:25:41.690 --> 05:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
if if I was to cross their border and
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
seek Asylum that I would be able to have
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
driving privileges I I'd very much like
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:25:58.550 --> 05:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
05:26:01.490 --> 05:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
so again I'm going back to the written
 
05:26:03.530 --> 05:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
part of this where where they're asking
 
05:26:03.540 --> 05:26:04.610 align:start position:0%
part of this where where they're asking
for

05:26:04.610 --> 05:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:26:07.368 --> 05:26:07.378 align:start position:0%
it says who has filed a complete
 
05:26:07.378 --> 05:26:08.810 align:start position:0%
it says who has filed a complete
application

05:26:08.810 --> 05:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
application
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
for Asylum I don't even I haven't seen a
 
05:26:13.550 --> 05:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
complete application I don't even know
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
what what's on there for one so that
 
05:26:16.970 --> 05:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
would make it very hard for me to make a
 
05:26:18.830 --> 05:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
decision like that and of course that's
 
05:26:20.270 --> 05:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
what the United States Senator
 
05:26:22.368 --> 05:26:22.378 align:start position:0%
citizenship and the immigration service
 
05:26:24.530 --> 05:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
so one moment we want to use the
 
05:26:26.090 --> 05:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
immigration service the next one we
 
05:26:28.490 --> 05:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to let them know anything
 
05:26:30.650 --> 05:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
and also on this it says written
 
05:26:33.410 --> 05:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of receipt well what is a
 
05:26:35.090 --> 05:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
written acknowledgment is that me just
 
05:26:37.368 --> 05:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
saying yeah okay you got a receipt I
 
05:26:39.530 --> 05:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
mean it doesn't there's not enough in
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
here and then the third part of this
 
05:26:44.330 --> 05:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's only good for 180 days and I
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
thought there was a further Gap I
 
05:26:47.570 --> 05:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
thought they said that there could be
 
05:26:50.090 --> 05:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
seven or eight month Gap here so it
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
might not cover everything even as it's
 
05:26:51.958 --> 05:26:53.810 align:start position:0%
might not cover everything even as it's
written

05:26:53.810 --> 05:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:26:57.190 --> 05:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the committee
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative Coker
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
I share representative sellers concerns
 
05:27:04.490 --> 05:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
about the um the question I have in the
 
05:27:06.410 --> 05:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
language and that's when it actually
 
05:27:08.810 --> 05:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
with a testimony for the real ID
 
05:27:11.810 --> 05:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
um it got brought up with a DMV
 
05:27:13.850 --> 05:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
um you know the question I have is that
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
just to fill that application and the
 
05:27:17.090 --> 05:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
receipt that it has it's kind of like
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay so they they filled an application
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
and they just get the receipt but it
 
05:27:22.730 --> 05:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
seems like there's different phases so
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I would vote to itl
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
it but yeah I'd rather retain it but
 
05:27:29.590 --> 05:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's just my I'd like to get that
 
05:27:32.330 --> 05:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
answered if anybody knows off the top of
 
05:27:36.050 --> 05:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:36.060 --> 05:27:43.368 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

05:27:43.368 --> 05:27:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
I don't have the answer for you either
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:27:51.650 --> 05:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:27:51.660 --> 05:27:52.970 align:start position:0%
seeing none
um

05:27:52.970 --> 05:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:54.350 --> 05:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the role
 
05:27:55.788 --> 05:27:55.798 align:start position:0%

okay representative Sykes would you care
 
05:29:34.730 --> 05:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion I I would Mr
 
05:29:36.770 --> 05:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I would just point
 
05:29:40.010 --> 05:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
out that many other states uh including
 
05:29:42.288 --> 05:29:42.298 align:start position:0%
some that would surprise you for example
 
05:29:45.770 --> 05:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
Texas allows Asylum Seekers to get a
 
05:29:48.910 --> 05:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license we do not prohibit
 
05:29:51.288 --> 05:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
Asylum Seekers from getting a driver's
 
05:29:53.150 --> 05:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
license here in New Hampshire we in fact
 
05:29:56.810 --> 05:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
allow it it's just a question of when
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so this is really just a technical
 
05:30:03.770 --> 05:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
fix to close that Gap and I would urge
 
05:30:05.930 --> 05:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
the committee members to vote in favor
 
05:30:09.708 --> 05:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
in simple terms for me
 
05:30:15.910 --> 05:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the process of seeking Asylum
 
05:30:18.770 --> 05:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
it is a process and and what this bill
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
seeks to do is to give a privilege from
 
05:30:22.850 --> 05:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for its
 
05:30:25.250 --> 05:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
driving privileges before that process
 
05:30:27.770 --> 05:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
is complete again kite before the horse
 
05:30:31.610 --> 05:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I'll be supporting the
 
05:30:33.530 --> 05:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh no I'll be opposed to the ought to
 
05:30:33.540 --> 05:30:35.448 align:start position:0%
uh no I'll be opposed to the ought to
pass

05:30:35.448 --> 05:30:35.458 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%

Mr chair I have a question
 
05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead representative
 
05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to make a motion
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%

05:31:48.170 --> 05:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:50.090 --> 05:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion to retain the
 
05:31:52.128 --> 05:31:52.138 align:start position:0%
bill representative Saint Claire moves
 
05:31:53.708 --> 05:31:53.718 align:start position:0%
retain on House Bill
 
05:31:58.910 --> 05:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:00.288 --> 05:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
sure I'll second
 
05:32:02.510 --> 05:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
by representative Smith would you care
 
05:32:06.288 --> 05:32:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:08.510 --> 05:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't realize I'd have to do that I I
 
05:32:10.128 --> 05:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
just think I think you know we've had
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
two votes uh 10 to 10 and I think this
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh we can maybe work on it just a
 
05:32:19.850 --> 05:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:26.690 --> 05:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
oop representative Smith
 
05:32:30.170 --> 05:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
so I have a lot of questions for such a
 
05:32:33.490 --> 05:32:33.500 align:start position:0%
small short bill so for example
 
05:32:38.570 --> 05:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
the written acknowledgment of receipt
 
05:32:42.610 --> 05:32:42.620 align:start position:0%
so I just looked up on Asylum Seeker
 
05:32:45.948 --> 05:32:45.958 align:start position:0%
advocacy project you can apply online
 
05:32:49.850 --> 05:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
and get this digital thing is this that
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
does it indicate that your application
 
05:32:55.010 --> 05:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
is complete because the bill says it has
 
05:32:56.708 --> 05:32:56.718 align:start position:0%
to be and I'm not sure that the receipt
 
05:32:59.390 --> 05:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
provides that so I don't know retain is
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to get answers to the all
 
05:33:04.690 --> 05:33:04.700 align:start position:0%
the information missing from the bill
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
he ain't none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
05:33:11.690 --> 05:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
the roll motion on the floor is to
 
05:33:17.330 --> 05:33:17.340 align:start position:0%

to reconsider on the floor it has been
 
05:51:30.718 --> 05:51:32.150 align:start position:0%
to reconsider on the floor it has been
seconded

05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
seconded
 
05:51:33.948 --> 05:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
did you care to speak to emotion on the
 
05:51:33.958 --> 05:51:37.310 align:start position:0%
did you care to speak to emotion on the
reconsideration

05:51:37.310 --> 05:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:40.430 --> 05:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
so I just think out of all the issues
 
05:51:42.048 --> 05:51:42.058 align:start position:0%
that I hear back from the constituents
 
05:51:44.090 --> 05:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
and it maybe I've just got a weird
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
District but people are unhappy with
 
05:51:49.490 --> 05:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
inspections uh you know and I get that
 
05:51:51.230 --> 05:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
we need them I I believe we need them
 
05:51:54.650 --> 05:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
for safety purposes but the system I
 
05:51:56.330 --> 05:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
mean since I I moved up here from
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
Florida about 10 years ago and when I
 
05:51:59.690 --> 05:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
got to New Hampshire to live for your
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
die State I was kind of shocked that we
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
had to do yearly inspections and not
 
05:52:06.650 --> 05:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
only that but the you know
 
05:52:08.990 --> 05:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
it there's it's it's just it's a broken
 
05:52:11.330 --> 05:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
system there's there's there's all kinds
 
05:52:13.430 --> 05:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
of you know I mean just there's so many
 
05:52:15.288 --> 05:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
stories about going to one shop and
 
05:52:17.448 --> 05:52:17.458 align:start position:0%
getting you know one story going to
 
05:52:19.368 --> 05:52:19.378 align:start position:0%
another shopping in a different story I
 
05:52:22.430 --> 05:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
mean this it needs to be fixed and I
 
05:52:25.070 --> 05:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
think by keeping the spill alive and uh
 
05:52:28.010 --> 05:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
retaining it afterwards it's gonna give
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
us some time to look and see if we can
 
05:52:31.910 --> 05:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually do something for it
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee
 
05:52:38.208 --> 05:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:40.610 --> 05:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
05:52:40.620 --> 05:52:42.470 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so

05:52:42.470 --> 05:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:44.470 --> 05:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against
 
05:52:47.270 --> 05:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
reconsideration and the reason for that
 
05:52:50.090 --> 05:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
is because the strength of the work that
 
05:52:51.530 --> 05:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
we do
 
05:52:54.530 --> 05:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
and the public nature of our work where
 
05:52:57.288 --> 05:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
we publicly notice bills that we're
 
05:52:59.390 --> 05:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to vote on and how we're going to
 
05:53:04.310 --> 05:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
hear testimony on is never a surprise to
 
05:53:04.320 --> 05:53:05.628 align:start position:0%
hear testimony on is never a surprise to
anybody

05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:53:08.990 --> 05:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think we voted one way and now we're
 
05:53:10.610 --> 05:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
going to vote again how many times are
 
05:53:12.770 --> 05:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
we going to be voting on bills again and
 
05:53:14.330 --> 05:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
again and again
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
negating the possibility for those
 
05:53:20.628 --> 05:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
important stakeholders to be present for
 
05:53:23.650 --> 05:53:23.660 align:start position:0%
the arguments the discussions and so on
 
05:53:26.948 --> 05:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
where they can participate whereas if
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
today they won't have that option so I
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
will vote against reconsideration that
 
05:53:34.910 --> 05:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
does not mean that I won't
 
05:53:37.730 --> 05:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
take under advisement the any subsequent
 
05:53:40.850 --> 05:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
motions I certainly will but for the
 
05:53:45.530 --> 05:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:48.288 --> 05:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
well representative Smith
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair those stakeholders
 
05:53:53.090 --> 05:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
already participated during the public
 
05:53:55.490 --> 05:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
hearing and were an executive session
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
now as we were the last time we voted on
 
05:53:59.208 --> 05:53:59.218 align:start position:0%
the bill and they do not get to
 
05:54:00.770 --> 05:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
participate in executive sessions that's
 
05:54:03.350 --> 05:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
what we debate amongst them ourselves so
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'd reject that argument if the bill
 
05:54:07.128 --> 05:54:07.138 align:start position:0%
does go to Rattan there will be work
 
05:54:08.868 --> 05:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
sessions and all those stakeholders can
 
05:54:11.208 --> 05:54:11.218 align:start position:0%
participate and that's actually My Hope
 
05:54:13.330 --> 05:54:13.340 align:start position:0%
because you're not in a weird District
 
05:54:16.128 --> 05:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact after I'd chaired
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
this committee for four years I became
 
05:54:21.170 --> 05:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
like DMV guy yay and got complaints from
 
05:54:23.708 --> 05:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
all over the state the system is broken
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
one of the largest problems that I hope
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
the committee could address because it's
 
05:54:32.810 --> 05:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
our fault is we passed the law and then
 
05:54:35.628 --> 05:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
put a 541a clause that says the
 
05:54:38.090 --> 05:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
department can create rules
 
05:54:39.650 --> 05:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
and like that's the end of our
 
05:54:42.110 --> 05:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
involvement we already had one incident
 
05:54:45.890 --> 05:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
with um rust failures so you you
 
05:54:48.110 --> 05:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to have a pretty car
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
in order to pass an inspection and this
 
05:54:53.448 --> 05:54:53.458 align:start position:0%
committee recognized that so instead we
 
05:54:55.910 --> 05:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
took the rust qualifications and put
 
05:54:58.430 --> 05:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
them in the statute so that it was no
 
05:55:00.230 --> 05:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
longer open to interpretation by the
 
05:55:02.948 --> 05:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
department or rules or anything
 
05:55:06.230 --> 05:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we believe a lot of
 
05:55:07.850 --> 05:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
stations even though that was years ago
 
05:55:10.730 --> 05:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
still don't have that information
 
05:55:14.750 --> 05:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
so technically when they fail a car for
 
05:55:17.390 --> 05:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
rust that's cosmetic they're violating
 
05:55:19.850 --> 05:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
the law but they're following the rules
 
05:55:21.830 --> 05:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like an opportunity to work on that
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
problem and figure out how this
 
05:55:24.830 --> 05:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee which has jurisdiction over
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
this issue gets control of the process
 
05:55:29.448 --> 05:55:29.458 align:start position:0%
again so that we have an answer for our
 
05:55:31.610 --> 05:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
constituents when they come to us thank
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
05:55:35.930 --> 05:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:55:38.810 --> 05:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add this to representative
 
05:55:41.628 --> 05:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
sakes I mean parliamentary speaking we
 
05:55:43.128 --> 05:55:43.138 align:start position:0%
still have possession of this bill as a
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee so reconsideration vote is
 
05:55:47.330 --> 05:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate because people do change
 
05:55:49.128 --> 05:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
their mind while we still have
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
possession of it I'm one of them I voted
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
for the itl two weeks ago or last week
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
whenever it was and it dawned on me
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
after the fact I've been defending this
 
05:56:00.890 --> 05:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
program for 10 years
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh taking my lumps in the process but
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
also aware that it's been broken for
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
years and it's nobody's fault that these
 
05:56:10.548 --> 05:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
things don't get addressed uh it's a
 
05:56:12.350 --> 05:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
large problem it needs to be looked at
 
05:56:15.770 --> 05:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
as such and with an Ito I know it's
 
05:56:17.330 --> 05:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
going to happen nothing is going to
 
05:56:20.208 --> 05:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
happen by retaining it which I hope is a
 
05:56:22.610 --> 05:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
subsequent motion we can really really
 
05:56:24.708 --> 05:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
look at this thing and try to resolve
 
05:56:26.030 --> 05:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that our citizens
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
have with this program if we can't it'll
 
05:56:30.170 --> 05:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
be the last time I defend it but right
 
05:56:32.448 --> 05:56:32.458 align:start position:0%
now this is a legitimate effort to get
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
into the weeds so I'll be supporting the
 
05:56:37.010 --> 05:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider and then we'll go
 
05:56:38.750 --> 05:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
from there anybody else from the
 
05:56:38.760 --> 05:56:42.670 align:start position:0%
from there anybody else from the
committee

05:56:42.670 --> 05:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:46.250 --> 05:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
if we retain this then would it uh end
 
05:56:48.170 --> 05:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
up on the Calendar's working session on
 
05:56:49.970 --> 05:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
Bill number something or other or how
 
05:56:51.288 --> 05:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
would that show up
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
so so what happens first we have to
 
05:56:55.850 --> 05:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
adopt or pass
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh reconsideration in the committee once
 
05:57:01.310 --> 05:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration if it passes then the
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor here will be the itl
 
05:57:07.730 --> 05:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
that we Pat voted on last week
 
05:57:10.250 --> 05:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
if we want to move any further with a
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
retain option then the itl will have to
 
05:57:15.350 --> 05:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
be voted down if the itl is voted down
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
then a subsequent motion of retain can
 
05:57:20.690 --> 05:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
be made so if we get to retain there
 
05:57:22.070 --> 05:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
will be nothing in the calendar on it
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then it'll be just once we get
 
05:57:26.690 --> 05:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
through our house business and in May or
 
05:57:28.070 --> 05:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
June or whether whenever the speaker
 
05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
allows to start working on retained
 
05:57:33.770 --> 05:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:35.448 --> 05:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
with no other questions I'll ask the
 
05:57:37.430 --> 05:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the roll the motion is on
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman I have a question if I may
 
05:58:36.058 --> 05:58:37.548 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I have a question if I may
um

05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
does a reconsideration motion on the
 
05:58:42.650 --> 05:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
floor of the house has to be made by the
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
prevailing side was that does that rule
 
05:58:46.670 --> 05:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
apply here too in committee
 
05:58:48.410 --> 05:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know that's why I'm asking I do
 
05:58:50.868 --> 05:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
not believe so okay
 
05:58:53.448 --> 05:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
but I believe in this case it was and
 
05:58:55.610 --> 05:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
just to become yeah I'm just I'm trying
 
05:58:58.070 --> 05:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
to learn too yeah
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
who made the motion to reconsider and
 
05:59:02.530 --> 05:59:02.540 align:start position:0%
seconded representative
 
05:59:06.368 --> 05:59:06.378 align:start position:0%
I don't know he was not a good deal
 
05:59:11.770 --> 05:59:11.780 align:start position:0%
he voted for the oh that's true well no
 
05:59:13.970 --> 05:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation with the clerk I
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't believe in committee has to be a
 
05:59:16.850 --> 05:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
member from the prevailing side but I
 
05:59:19.430 --> 05:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
can double check with Steve yeah who's
 
05:59:28.990 --> 05:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
I was even
 
05:59:32.930 --> 05:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
we're working on it
 
05:59:34.610 --> 05:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
I was even going to suggest it could be
 
05:59:36.530 --> 05:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
for subsequently well it wasn't going to
 
05:59:38.330 --> 05:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
change anything about this
 
05:59:38.340 --> 05:59:42.110 align:start position:0%
change anything about this
okay

05:59:42.110 --> 05:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:44.230 --> 05:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:59:48.048 --> 05:59:48.058 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion of reconsideration
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
um is adopted 12 to 8. so that brings us
 
05:59:52.430 --> 05:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:59:56.208 --> 05:59:56.218 align:start position:0%
this current motion of itl so as I

I have I'm going to be looking for
 
06:03:23.930 --> 06:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
committee reports before we leave the
 
06:03:26.030 --> 06:03:26.040 align:start position:0%

06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
do them on paper or as as you you
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully still have
 
06:03:34.250 --> 06:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the electronic form that was sent to
 
06:03:35.930 --> 06:03:35.940 align:start position:0%

06:03:39.070 --> 06:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
I have 374.

enough
um

06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:20.288 --> 06:04:20.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.610 --> 06:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
so I think we're all good with the
 
06:04:24.350 --> 06:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
majority reports are there any minority
 
06:04:27.610 --> 06:04:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:31.250 --> 06:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
just email them to me okay all right
 
06:04:31.260 --> 06:04:32.868 align:start position:0%
just email them to me okay all right
yeah

06:04:32.868 --> 06:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:04:34.910 --> 06:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you can get them to me tonight
 
06:04:37.610 --> 06:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like I'd like to submit them tonight
 
06:04:40.730 --> 06:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
so because they there's a chance some of
 
06:04:41.930 --> 06:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
them get on the calendar if they've got
 
06:04:42.850 --> 06:04:42.860 align:start position:0%
them tonight
 
06:04:42.860 --> 06:04:44.770 align:start position:0%
them tonight
maybe

06:04:44.770 --> 06:04:44.780 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
06:04:47.090 --> 06:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully they don't have to
 
06:04:47.100 --> 06:05:02.208 align:start position:0%
hopefully they don't have to
representative

06:05:02.208 --> 06:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:04.010 --> 06:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
do you have a question representative uh
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes we have house session on next
 
06:05:09.650 --> 06:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so uh will we be trying to get
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
anything done around the schedule that
 
06:05:17.570 --> 06:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
right here I don't think so so I'll look
 
06:05:18.770 --> 06:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
at it I
 
06:05:20.690 --> 06:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
we had a couple hours in the morning if
 
06:05:22.430 --> 06:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
we needed to for any early bills but
 
06:05:23.690 --> 06:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
seeing as how we've accomplished that
 
06:05:26.750 --> 06:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
today we don't need that day
 
06:05:29.690 --> 06:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'm leaning towards no for the 14th only
 
06:05:31.548 --> 06:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
because of session
 
06:05:33.948 --> 06:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
the question then would be do you want
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
the following week is that is that
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
school break
 
06:05:36.958 --> 06:05:38.628 align:start position:0%
school break
yeah

06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:05:40.368 --> 06:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask that school break is
 
06:05:42.708 --> 06:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
the 27th week okay so then plan on
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
meeting back here on the 21st 21st okay
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
because we're in session the 23rd we
 
06:05:49.128 --> 06:05:49.138 align:start position:0%
think and maybe the 22nd right but we
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
could be here on the 21st yeah okay
 
06:05:52.430 --> 06:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
we're in pretty good shape we've only
 
06:05:54.770 --> 06:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
got four more bills to hear okay so I'm
 
06:05:54.780 --> 06:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
got four more bills to hear okay so I'm
thinking

06:05:55.910 --> 06:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
06:05:59.150 --> 06:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
well I won't be too optimistic about one
 
06:06:01.788 --> 06:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
more committee day but it's possible I
 
06:06:03.470 --> 06:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
mean so four more here wow they're going
 
06:06:04.850 --> 06:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
to be some long hearings so I think
 
06:06:06.650 --> 06:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to need two more days but
 
06:06:08.810 --> 06:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
again for our for our the other bills we
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to report out until March
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
16th so we have plenty of time thank you
 
06:06:16.070 --> 06:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes so on the calendar it says
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
that if on the 14th our committees could
 
06:06:20.690 --> 06:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
meet in the afternoon after everything's
 
06:06:22.850 --> 06:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
done over at the big Hall is that not a
 
06:06:25.190 --> 06:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
possibility for us
 
06:06:30.310 --> 06:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
well I'm down here so it doesn't matter
 
06:06:34.010 --> 06:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
to me well that's a good point hold on
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:43.150 --> 06:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:46.128 --> 06:06:46.138 align:start position:0%
we are going to
 
06:06:48.110 --> 06:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
do House business
 
06:06:50.570 --> 06:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
do the budget address if that's over
 
06:06:52.368 --> 06:06:52.378 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go back into doing bills if
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
we have any
 
06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:59.448 --> 06:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
yes it is
 
06:07:01.368 --> 06:07:01.378 align:start position:0%
no you can't really unless the
 
06:07:03.288 --> 06:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
designated time was at the end of
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
session because we don't know when
 
06:07:09.590 --> 06:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
