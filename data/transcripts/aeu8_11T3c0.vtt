00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
I was told to remind everybody that if
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
when you speak if you could turn your
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
microphone on that would be great I'm
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
going to call the subcommittee work
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
session to order of 10 4 22. today we
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
have two bills that we're going to work
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
through HB 426 which will take first
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
relative to shorterland septic systems
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
then SB 257 enabling municipalities to
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
incorporate sewage Disposal Systems as
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
part of the storm water utility this is
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
a work session it's not a hearing if we
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
need clarification and there's someone
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
in the audience that could clarify or
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
add to something I'm told we can have
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
that but we're not taking testimony
 
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.730 align:start position:0%
that but we're not taking testimony
today

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh I want to thank representative Spang
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
she passed out everyone here should have
 
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.130 align:start position:0%
she passed out everyone here should have
it

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
um a brief
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
dissertation on Shoreland septic systems
 
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize her she's
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
going to speak briefly to her report
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
here which I have given and Will Go On
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
actually huh okay we'll see what we can
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
do here
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
okay this bill came right out of a
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
two-year Shoreline septic system study
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
commission that had about 20 people on
 
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:42.380 align:start position:0%
it very representative of municipalities
 
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:45.140 align:start position:0%
septic designers
 
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.690 align:start position:0%
septic designers
environmentalists

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:46.700 align:start position:0%
environmentalists
 
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
the Realtors uh and uh so we had a good
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of how it was any
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
solutions we came up with would affect
 
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:01.820 align:start position:0%
each one of those parties
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it was approved by the 20-member
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
commission by everyone there but the
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
Realtors and Des abstained the problem
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
is that there are
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of there's a lot of pollution that
 
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:24.140 align:start position:0%
is occurring because of
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
underperforming septic systems in the
 
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:30.260 align:start position:0%
Shoreland Zone it's very hard to find
 
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
which ones it is without infringing upon
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
private property rights
 
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
we decided to try to
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
inch away a wind inch toward how to make
 
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.110 align:start position:0%
inch away a wind inch toward how to make
that

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
determination the first thing that would
 
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:54.740 align:start position:0%
be obvious is this older ones before
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
1967's septic system did not have to be
 
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.140 align:start position:0%
approved by Des
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
so they're kind of wild cards after that
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
then Des was looking at uh at permitting
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
them so we knew that the one that the
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
ones that were most likely to be in
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
Failure were those that did not have
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
state permits
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
and they could now be
 
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
and they could now be
um

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
up to 50 years old so you can imagine if
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
they've been up to 50 years old and
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps never pumped never inspected the
 
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
houses that they are serving may have
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
doubled and tripled in terms of the
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
intensity of their usage so that looked
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
like a good place to start
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
so we began to then look at how we could
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
get a handle on those again without
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
infringing upon private property owners
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
and there have been several uh efforts
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
put forward by lakes groups to do some
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
heavy educational work of the property
 
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.810 align:start position:0%
heavy educational work of the property
owners

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
um getting volunteers out there to talk
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
to them and
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
then contact the members on that the
 
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
people who own Shoreland properties on
 
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.930 align:start position:0%
people who own Shoreland properties on
impaired

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
water bodies that are particularly have
 
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:30.260 align:start position:0%
blooms or cyanobacteria Etc
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
those turned out to be really successful
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
in some instances like 13 out of 15 of
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
the septic systems that were or 20
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
septic systems that were examined
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
with landowner permission termed out to
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
be in failure
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
and then that then the volunteer group
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
was able to get some State funding to
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
help those property owners
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
ameliorate their systems in some cases
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
like on babusik Lake it was tremendously
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
successful and they were able to
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate the severe cyanobacteria
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
blooms that had happened so we know that
 
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:21.500 align:start position:0%
that is going to work but that is
 
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:27.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
the only other time that the state can
 
00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:33.539 align:start position:0%
have any intervention
 
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
is when a property exchanges hands and
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
already we say that you have to have an
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the site to say yes the
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
site can have a septic system that will
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
serve the kind of property that you are
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
the house that you're thinking of
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
putting up there but that's as far as it
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
goes if there is a septic system there
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the property is exchanging hands
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's no way to say whether that
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
septic system is indeed in failure and
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
is going to or underperforming and is
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
going to be continue
 
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
to affect the water quality under its
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
new ownership
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
so it seemed that in addition to having
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
an evaluation of the site to see if the
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
land is capable of holding a septic
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
system we should also be requiring that
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
the septic system itself should be
 
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.630 align:start position:0%
the septic system itself should be
evaluated

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
now this I think there was some concern
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
about who's going to pay for this and
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
that you know there's a lot of
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of negotiation around around costs
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
and expenses and who pays what when a
 
00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:54.539 align:start position:0%
property exchanges hands um there's a
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
property owner the seller pay for things
 
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
like this does the buyer pay for things
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
like this does the realtor help to pay
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
for the things like this all of that can
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
be worked out even on an individual
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
basis just as long as the state is
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
um the result of it would not
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily say that the prop it would
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
block the property exchange it would
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
just but the report would go to the
 
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
local code enforcement officer and to
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
Des so Des could see where these
 
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:34.580 align:start position:0%
problems are
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
it was also seen as being a real Boon to
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
the property buyer so he wasn't buying a
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
pig in a poke he wasn't buying a septic
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
system where the the seller said see
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
there's nothing squishy on about it's
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
fine it's fine and then they find
 
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539 align:start position:0%
themselves having to uh
 
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380 align:start position:0%
to build to rebuild their septic system
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
so it was really uh
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
a protective thing for the property
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
buyer and a big plus for the State of
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in terms of finding out
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
which septic systems might be a problem
 
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.669 align:start position:0%
which septic systems might be a problem
now

00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not all of them it's only
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
the ones that are exchanging hands and
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's only the ones within a certain
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
distance to a water body but it's a
 
00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:30.419 align:start position:0%
start and it's one that the commission
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
felt was very achievable
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are that is how the
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
bill came about
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative what I'd like
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
to do is since there's only five of us
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
go around the table for comments
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative glottling do you would
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
you like to speak on this uh Bill uh I
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
would and just say that uh in our town
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
uh one of the reasons septics have come
 
00:25:59.649 --> 00:25:59.659 align:start position:0%
into uh
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
discussion is that we are dealing with
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
uh what people are perceiving as
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
problems with short-term rentals and
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
concern that houses that are sometimes
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
shall we say overpopulated
 
00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
maybe stressing the septic systems and
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh so we're really uh
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the problems because
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
although we have a portion of of the
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
lake front covered by an actual sewer
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
system and I'm lucky enough to be one of
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
those we have a lot of other portions of
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
the lake that do not have a sewer system
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
for them and uh I as you will remember
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
from my short from my uh Perkins
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
Pondville uh before that that uh
 
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.890 align:start position:0%
Pondville uh before that that uh
uh

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
sewer system went in around the pond
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
there there were latrines and there were
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
there were all kinds of really really
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
really old ineffective uh systems in
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
place and this Pond now it that it is a
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
Haven for short-term rentals but
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
fortunately everybody there has to be on
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
the sewer but uh had we not done that it
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
would probably be overwhelming uh so so
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
I would just say from our town it's uh
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
the short-term rentals have kind of
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
highlighted the fact that we have many
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh old systems
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
and not not really a good mechanism for
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of them
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just gonna I talked to our
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
Town manager of the and the
 
00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:56.330 align:start position:0%
Town manager of the and the
um

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
Kyle Fox director of Public Works about
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
this in
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
um one of the things he said that they
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
like to keep it local all the time and
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
the reason was and I know you brought up
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
Baboosic Lake
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
um right now they are at sixteen hundred
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
dollars per year with a state average
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
for sewers is
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
about 590.
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
Merrimack we pay 357. when they do this
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see the local people make
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
that decision whether that's going to
 
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.890 align:start position:0%
that decision whether that's going to
happen

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
um in Amherst on the Busick Lake they
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
decided that
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
that wasn't going to be the town was
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to pay for it and if they the
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
local group wanted to do that they did
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
and they did get together and they got
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
together and they decided to do that
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
solar system
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
um but they brought it up the the cost
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
upon it with them on them themselves so
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
I still always say let the let the towns
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
decide in this and let them let them
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
make the decision whether they're going
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Healy I think we're
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
talking about whether the septic systems
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
need evaluation yes I know okay all
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
right I wasn't sure if you were crossing
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
over to the next no when she was talking
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
about I was just covering up when she
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
was saying it would be it was with music
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
Lake that they did yes there was but it
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
was constantly obvious
 
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.730 align:start position:0%
 
they're

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
just here to visit my first subcommittee
 
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:41.570 align:start position:0%
just here to visit my first subcommittee
here

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.769 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
it was suggested I remind those that are
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
speaking when you're done
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
button off so that you won't be taking
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I just I was wondering if we
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
have ever we must have had commissions
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
on how to handle failed septic systems
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
I or have we
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
um but I would like to see more of a
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
study committee done uh since this is a
 
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
problem like everywhere it's it's it's
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
been a problem endemic and and I
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the problem of failed septic
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
systems is a big problem and
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I really appreciate that the
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
education worked as representative Spang
 
00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
was pointing out uh how well it worked
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
to address it directly to the homeowners
 
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.610 align:start position:0%
to address it directly to the homeowners
um

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
so I mean I I would like to see that and
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say about that
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Spang you wanted to
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
comment again uh yes
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
in terms of the um
 
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.250 align:start position:0%
in terms of the um
the

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
we of course we've already had a
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
two-year commission looking into this
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
program and this bill came out of that
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
two-year commission and it was we tried
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
every angle that we could in terms of
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
how to look at it and also the science
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
behind how a septic system works and
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
alternative Innovative new ways of doing
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
it so we really looked over that pretty
 
00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:35.210 align:start position:0%
it so we really looked over that pretty
carefully

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
in terms of keeping it local
 
00:31:39.179 --> 00:31:39.889 align:start position:0%
in terms of keeping it local
um

00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
the low the municipalities are not now
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
enabled by State Statute to do anything
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
the towns of Meredith
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the other towns had
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
tried to bring about some set a local
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
controls over septic systems and they
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
were told that they did not have the
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
statutory ability to do it so then they
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
went uh digging deep into their
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances and Interstate statutes to
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
find an alternative way of skirting
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
around that problem and they they're
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
trying to work with their building codes
 
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:25.460 align:start position:0%
or CFOs
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
but none of that is secure enough to put
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
that forward as an approach that other
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities could use so essentially
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that
 
00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:43.220 align:start position:0%
brought about this commission was that
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
municipalities do not have the ability
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
to do this on their own they need some
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative my take on this
 
00:32:58.679 --> 00:33:00.110 align:start position:0%
thank you representative my take on this
is

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:03.419 align:start position:0%
I think it's a buyer beware I think that
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
I sort of go along with the remarks of
 
00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of Realtors
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
in this particular area the 200 feet or
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's 200 250 the assessment's
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
done but on all the purchase and sale
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
agreements the buyer has given the right
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
to do more inspections more reviews
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
nobody's saying they can't ask to do it
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
so instead of mandating it I think the
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
ability is there I'm not one for
 
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
mandating this and I had mentioned
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
during our original discussions I'm
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
concerned that this could turn into what
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
they have in Massachusetts title five I
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
think the ability to test the system I
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
agree that yeah it's a big expense if
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
suddenly it fails but the buyer can do
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
this inspection he can do the evaluation
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
and a lot of my buyers because this is
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
the field I'm in they do have it
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
evaluated to make sure they're not going
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
to have this sudden drastic problem they
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
didn't need a law to say you have to
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
they just went and did it and they
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
absorbed the cost so we're not worried
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
about the cost because they said we'll
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
absorb it for the large expenditure of
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
buying a new home
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm not personally in favor of this
 
00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.510 align:start position:0%
so I'm not personally in favor of this
bill

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
is anyone on the committee subcommittee
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
wish to say anything further
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
add one thing which is that in our town
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
at least many uh sales were taking place
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
and inspections of any kind were simply
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
ignored and uh we also have a number of
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
out of out of town out of state buyers
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
who really don't have a big commitment
 
00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
who really don't have a big commitment
to

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
you know what they're doing so that's
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
just another aspect of where our concern
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you it was brought to my attention
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
that what we're supposed to do was the
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we have two choices on
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
motions to recommend for future
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend for future
 
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.349 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend for future
legislation

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
if none of the subcommittee members have
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything else entertain a motion from
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
someone either to recommend or not
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
if I of course
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
um I think that the problem is you know
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
this in in the Bible beware thing
 
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
um really resonates with me you know
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
you're going to buy you're going to buy
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
anything without checking whether it's
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
going to cost you a fortune to keep that
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
car on the road or whatever
 
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.550 align:start position:0%
car on the road or whatever
um

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
but in those instances you're the only
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
one who's going to be affected by
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
whether you buy an inferior product
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
in this instance if you buy an inferior
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
product and you decide that you don't
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
want to put in the money or you don't
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
even want to know with your septic
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
system is polluting your Lake it's not
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
just you it's everybody who lives along
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
that Lake who is paying the price for
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
your having decided to turn a blind eye
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
to this there's nothing that says that
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
if you buy a house with a bad septic
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
system that anyone is going to make you
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.170 align:start position:0%
fix it
so

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
um it's not just you know you're being
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're whether you're going to have to
 
00:36:49.329 --> 00:36:49.339 align:start position:0%
be putting in a lot of money to fix this
 
00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:53.540 align:start position:0%
it's whether what the impact of your
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
negligence is going to be on everybody
 
00:36:59.290 --> 00:36:59.300 align:start position:0%
else who lives along the lake
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
you could draw parallel with having your
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
car inspected
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
um Inspire beware if you buy a car that
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
won't pass inspection but why do we have
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
a state program where everybody's car is
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
inspected it's because it affects
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
everybody if your car is an unsafe car
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's the same situation here
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
where you can decide that as a buyer you
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
don't care whether your septic system is
 
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.730 align:start position:0%
don't care whether your septic system is
failing

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
failing
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
but everybody else around that lake is
 
00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:40.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I'm still
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
waiting on a motion Mr chair
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
speak I know I'm not on the subcommittee
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
but my understanding was that all
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee were invited to
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
attend and participate in these but we
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
just couldn't vote
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
so that's I have to believe what the
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
chair uh chair ranzulo put in the email
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
but what I wanted to clarify a little
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
bit is what the interim study uh
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
the bill is off the table this bill is
 
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.210 align:start position:0%
the bill is off the table this bill is
gone

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
gone
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
so the motion to recommend for future
 
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
legislation or not isn't necessarily
 
00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
this bill it could be a small part of
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
this bill it could be to refine the
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
definition of what a failed system
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
septic system is it could be to just
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
tweak uh stuff and it's not anything
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we have to totally decide today but
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
it could be we recommend for future
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
legislation because the statute isn't
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
clear blah blah blah blah blah in some
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
area so I just wanted to clarify when
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
you say not recommended for future
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
legislation you're talking about the
 
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
issue of Shoreland septic systems not
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
this particular bill because this
 
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
particular bill is interim studied which
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
means this bill is dead we would be
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
recommending yes or no on any future
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
legislation related to Shoreland septic
 
00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:08.579 align:start position:0%
systems just wanted to clarify that
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
motion that we recommend this for um for
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
further legislation what I'm hearing um
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
from two of our members is that there's
 
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
a desire not to take this approach but
 
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
to make it more local
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and and that would seem to me to be
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
an exploration of how to uh
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
enable municipalities to develop their
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
own regulations relative to failing
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
septic systems that are polluting their
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
local lakes and it seems to me that
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
something that it was brought forward
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
very pointedly uh by the town of
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
Meredith that was trying very hard to
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
protect its water supply
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be that there are some
 
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:06.140 align:start position:0%
and I'm very big on local local control
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
also uh so since that was the program
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
the problem that's was clearly
 
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.210 align:start position:0%
the problem that's was clearly
identified

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
by the commission and seems to have some
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
resonate resonance with the member of
 
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
this committee that we recommend that
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
this be brought forward for future
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
legislation to solve the problem from
 
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
that direction thank you representative
 
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
do we have a second
 
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:40.970 align:start position:0%
do we have a second
elephant

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
hearing none will take a vote
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative Spang
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
yes this is a vote to recommend for
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
future legislation with your motion yeah
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative gottling
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
and myself the subcommittee chair I vote
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
no so that motion failed
 
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
put a motion into not recommend for
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
we have a motion by representative Healy
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
not to recommend seconded by
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
hearing none representative Healy
 
00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.730 align:start position:0%
hearing none representative Healy
yes

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative how are you Boley
 
00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.510 align:start position:0%
yes representative how are you Boley
yeah

00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:02.339 align:start position:0%
representative Spang no
 
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
representative gottlene
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
and myself representative harb yes
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
so three to two we will recommend to the
 
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
full committee at executive session not
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation thank
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
you so that concludes our discussion on
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
SB 257 enabling municipalities to
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate sewage Disposal Systems as
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
since we started the last time with
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Spang for comment I think
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'll start this time with representative
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
Healy on my left representative Healy do
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
you want to comment on this bill SB 257.
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'll comment a little bit on this
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
um we and Merrimack just went through uh
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
hiring an ms4 engineer
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
um for this uh specific system of our
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
systems now which is actually separate
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
so we don't really have to do too much
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
um it it's quite an expense to the towns
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and again the towns made the decision
 
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
to make this uh to hire this ms4
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
Engineers so I'm I'm
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
going forward with this I would say the
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
same thing that I would like rather that
 
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
the the towns make a decision or
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
anything on any of all of this stuff
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
um it ends up being at the engineering
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
anything and then this engineer makes
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
anywhere from seventy five thousand to a
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
um it was a ballot question also so I
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
want to keep it that way
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
I I agree with the representative Healy
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
looked at this uh quite a bit I did some
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
background work I guess there's a study
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
happening right now and the uh Dover
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
area to look at it's like a pilot
 
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.950 align:start position:0%
area to look at it's like a pilot
program

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.609 align:start position:0%
program
um

00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
that they're doing uh on their own to
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
study this so I'm curious to see
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with that I think
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
the bill needs some work I'd like to see
 
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.609 align:start position:0%
the bill needs some work I'd like to see
Municipal

00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if it's really more
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
suited and the municipal uh committee
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
than ours but it is uh it's it's fine if
 
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
Town towns want to do it but I certainly
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
don't want to mandate it um
 
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.930 align:start position:0%
don't want to mandate it um
for

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh for everybody
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
um that's it thanks thank you
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
and we can jump over you and go to
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I think that there is a problem with
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
this bill because it has
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit difficult to get your
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
arms around in terms of there are a
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
couple of or several components to it
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
one is it
 
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
means that you have to understand
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
how your utility works like how our
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
storm water utility works the stormwater
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
utility basically says that whoever is
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for creating the problem
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
should have some responsibility for
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
solving that problem at some level
 
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:49.970 align:start position:0%
solving that problem at some level
um

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
not there is not one single municipality
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
to date that has adopted this it would
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
require the support of the whole
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
municipality it wouldn't be something
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
where the state would be imposing this
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
on any municipality it is strictly by a
 
00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
local choice
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
um the second thing is what is the
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
problem that it solves I think that
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps it was Mr deers or Carolyn
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
Russell who told us about situations
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
where there was kind of a mini Community
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
where they were all in failure
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
and what do you do about that are you
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
going to make every single one of those
 
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:38.060 align:start position:0%
do an individual
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
upgrade or replacement of their septic
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
system or can it be done collectively as
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
a neighborhood and if that neighborhood
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
can plug into a municipal system with
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
all these other neighborhoods where this
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
is a problem then the cost gets
 
00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
is a problem then the cost gets
dispersed

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
dispersed
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
um and it becomes the
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
the septics problem isn't just a problem
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
of each individual property owner but it
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
becomes something that the community as
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
a whole has decided that they want to do
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
something for their water body
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um as a whole and they want to make it
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
part of the whole tax base instead of it
 
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
being something that an individual would
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
be paying now
 
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
the third component is and I think that
 
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
this really
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
raise some eyebrows is the problem that
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
we have in the Great Bay Estuary where
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
we have to do something at more than an
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
individual septic system level to try to
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
clean up the bay and EPA is breathing
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
down our necks to come up with some
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
solution to these individual septic
 
00:47:59.450 --> 00:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
systems that are collectively causing a
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
big problem and I think that having this
 
00:48:07.089 --> 00:48:07.099 align:start position:0%
tool in place
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
would help to reassure EPA that we're on
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
the road to doing this and once again I
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
would like to emphasize the word tool
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandate by the state it's a
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
tool that a municipality can take to
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
deal with multiple septic system
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
failures on individual properties so I
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
given that there is no mandate involved
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
that is just enabling municipalities to
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
take one approach whether they like it
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
or then I think that we should
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
um get this moving along thank you
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:48:53.339 --> 00:48:55.450 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Gottlieb

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:55.460 align:start position:0%
Gottlieb
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm looking at
 
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
who's supported and who did not in at
 
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
our hearing and Des definitely supported
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
this bill and as in our other Bill the
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
Realtors opposed and the Dover City
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
Council supported and you know we talk
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
about letting towns Take the Lead but if
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
they need permission to take the lead uh
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
we're sort of talking out of both sides
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
and we're not really being
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
straightforward about what we really
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
I agree with some of the committee
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members that there there is
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
a problem with the nitrogen and the
 
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:50.540 align:start position:0%
systems but is this really the solution
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
I also seem to agree
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
um that if we put government back
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
locally and the local people decide they
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
wish it maybe that's more appropriate
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
than a mandate for everyone
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm sort of betwixting between I
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
don't think the bill as representative
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
Smith says we're not really dealing with
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
the bill that was presented I don't
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
think that solves the problem but I do
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
think that it is an issue that could use
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh future study and and work
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
so I I likely would support a
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation for future legislation so
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
that the topic can be worked on and
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll and anything else from the
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
so I'll entertain a motion from someone
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
to recommend or not recommend for future
 
00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:50.450 align:start position:0%
to recommend or not recommend for future
legislation

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
and just just to clarify so we would be
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
recommending the I the idea of the bill
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
for future recommendations not the bills
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
not the bill itself okay so basically
 
00:51:04.329 --> 00:51:04.339 align:start position:0%
the concept that's inside the concept
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
okay I'm interpreting representative
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
Smith correctly
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
concept would live on but it needs work
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
and we could support the concept of
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
local control
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay but for future legislation not
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay I I would make that recommendation
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
so I have a motion
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
by representative Harvey bolia to
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
any discussion on that motion
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh just what what specifically are we
 
00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:56.030 align:start position:0%
uh just what what specifically are we
recommending

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding would be we're
 
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:00.140 align:start position:0%
recommending future
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that would relate to the
 
00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:08.300 align:start position:0%
I say it right a nitrogen level and
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
septic systems and
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
local control
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I'm not opposed to that
 
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.130 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I'm not opposed to that
yeah

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
so we don't kill the idea we keep the
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
idea moving with work
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
so that's the motion the second any more
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on it okay so I'll call a
 
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.809 align:start position:0%
discussion on it okay so I'll call a
roll

00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
roll
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey bolia yes
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Healy yes
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Spang yeah
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
and my self-representative harb I vote
 
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.770 align:start position:0%
and my self-representative harb I vote
Yes

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
Yes
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
so that will go forward to the entire
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
committee at the executive session on
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill SB 257 recommended for future
 
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.170 align:start position:0%
this bill SB 257 recommended for future
legislation

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I believe that concludes what we're
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
here for today and I thank you all for
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
coming down on a sunny day hopefully it
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
gets a little warmer and we'll see you
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
at the um unless anybody has anything
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
else to say we'll see you at the exact
 
00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
session that's already scheduled
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
so I call this uh session closed thank
