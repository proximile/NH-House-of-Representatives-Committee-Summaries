00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal Committee of the general court
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
for August 11th is called to order
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
first item on the agenda is acceptance
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
of the minutes of June 24th
 
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.629 align:start position:0%
 
seconds

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
all in favor say aye aye any opposed say
 
00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
all in favor say aye aye any opposed say
no

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
what's that I explained I was not here
 
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
at that meeting very good
 
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
two abstentions it passes
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
okay is there any old business I don't
 
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
believe so
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
and by the way the consent calendar
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
covers Tab 3 4
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe we had any requests
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
to remove anything from consent from the
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
house meeting anything from the Senate
 
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.629 align:start position:0%
house meeting anything from the Senate
meeting

00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
nothing to be removed remove the consent
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
second all right move to pass the
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and there's a second
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none all in
 
00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
favor say aye aye opposed no
 
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
consent calendar is adopted so we'll
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
move on to the regular calendar under
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
first item on Tab 8. is
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice 23 205 the
 
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
litigation expenses and we have John
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
Broderick here as the administrator who
 
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:50.540 align:start position:0%
could answer any questions
 
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:53.540 align:start position:0%
Sir Mr chair if I could uh attorney
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
general for mellers here for uh 23 205.
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then Justice Broderick is here for
 
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:02.660 align:start position:0%
the next item all right very good
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
the committee uh John fermella attorney
 
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
general I'm joined up here by Kathy Carr
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
our director of administration and I
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
think the first item that is is ours is
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
the litigation fund request which I
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
could give a quick overview of I'm also
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions regarding um
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
the submission from the administrator
 
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
but the on the YDC claims fund but he is
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
here as well so I certainly would not
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
want to want to preempt him but to the
 
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
extent you have questions for me on that
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
topic I'm absolutely happy to answer
 
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.550 align:start position:0%
topic I'm absolutely happy to answer
them

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
on the litigation fund request the
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
letter summarizes it but this this is
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
the request that we come to fiscal for
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
every year for our litigation fund our
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
litigation fund supplements uh the
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
Departments the resources the department
 
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
has for defending the state and civil
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
claims Prosecuting criminal cases
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
consumer protection cases Environmental
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
Protection cases and really everything
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
this request this year's for about 6.9
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
it is a high request in the context of
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
the whole history of litigation fund it
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
is less than we requested last year I
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
think last year we requested about 7.8
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars if I have that right of
 
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
it was around that
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
so we do have we do have a decrease
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
um as I note in the in the item the
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
department continues to deal with the
 
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.019 align:start position:0%
particularly High load of complex civil
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
litigation and that really
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
comes primarily from the from the YDC
 
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
litigation you'll note in the letter
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're requesting 2.9 Million Dollars to
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
assist with that there's a couple of
 
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:57.860 align:start position:0%
components when it comes to that one is
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
defending against the now I think it's
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
over 1 000 claims against the state that
 
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
are in litigation it's one case because
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
they're all Consolidated but it's really
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
a thousand different cases so there's
 
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
that component of it there's also
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
assisting the Department of Health and
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
Human Services with responding to the
 
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Bureau and the criminal
 
00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:20.459 align:start position:0%
investigation so that is also a function
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
of the Civil Bureau so those two
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
components combined
 
00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:26.459 align:start position:0%
necessitate at least by my estimate here
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the fiscal year
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
about 2.9 Million Dollars this coming
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and a lot of that is review
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
of documents and responding to discover
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
requests requests responding to
 
00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:39.889 align:start position:0%
requests requests responding to
subpoenas

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
subpoenas
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
one thing we do very well in this state
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
is retain documents for a long time and
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
so when you end up with something like
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
this where you are investigating a
 
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
series of events that played out over
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
decades that involves reviewing a lot of
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
documents and that is a large part of
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
the cost here
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
so um there's also
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
the criminal investigation for YDC
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
you'll see that request is for about 1.1
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars that is less than last
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
year we have been able to continue to
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
dedicate internal resources and move
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
these cases along to a point where we do
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
estimate spending less this coming
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal year but we estimate about 1.1
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars there as compared to
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
about 2.2 million dollars last fiscal
 
00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:24.110 align:start position:0%
about 2.2 million dollars last fiscal
year

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
for the the remaining large items are
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
the two cases that I note in here for
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
Services one case deals with a
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
with the challenge to how the department
 
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
is administering its choices for
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
Independence program and another case is
 
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.829 align:start position:0%
Independence program and another case is
um

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
are claims uh based on how
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
how we
 
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.730 align:start position:0%
how we
um

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:48.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
we serve disabled youth in foster care
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
those two cases together we estimate a
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
need of about 1.5 million dollars and
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of reasons for the for
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
the major needs there one those are
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
those are major federal court cases
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're class actions they involve a lot
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
of documents a lot of document review
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
they also involved some specialized
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
areas of law which
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
the good thing is the department is is I
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
think we are strengthening our our
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
expertise in that area because of these
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
cases but they are they are new types of
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
litigation that the department is
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with that we really have not
 
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
dealt with before so we're also using
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
some outside Council support for those
 
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
some outside Council support for those
cases

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
the remaining request is just for
 
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
the the wide variety of other cases the
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
department deals with that involves
 
00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:40.019 align:start position:0%
a larger number of cases for much
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
smaller amounts across the criminal
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
justice Bureau across the Environmental
 
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau across the consumer
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau all of
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
that adds up to about the 6.9 million
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
dollars so that that's an overview and
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
regarding this request
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions for the attorney generals
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
Senator bird sells seconds
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you I did have a
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
couple of questions if I could
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
so that 2.9 Million dollars that are
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
incurring for the YDC
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
assault cases is
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
you in a different fiscal item I think
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
your reporting costs of 340
 
00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:33.670 align:start position:0%
your reporting costs of 340
000

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
charged against the fund
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how you
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
decide what goes to the fund and what
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
goes to the general funds but so we're
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 3.2
 
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:51.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars of cost
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
relative to about 4.9 million dollars of
 
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.329 align:start position:0%
relative to about 4.9 million dollars of
settlements

00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
settlements
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
from the fund it is that a particularly
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
High proportion of cost
 
00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
relative to settlement
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question Senator
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
because I think it it provides a good
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me to to clarify a
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
couple things
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
with YDC we have we have one
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
um one part of the office the civil
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
litigation Bureau is handling the
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
litigation so the case is in court we've
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
split off the the AG designee function
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
under the settlement fund and so the as
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
you know the expense the funds we're
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
requesting today are for expenses
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
related to the litigation the funds
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
you're noting of about three hundred
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars under the settlement
 
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.060 align:start position:0%
fund those are
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
expenses incurred by us utilizing
 
00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:49.339 align:start position:0%
outside counsel for some assistance with
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
reviewing and analyzing claims that are
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
that are submitted to the claims fund
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
and those expenses are billed to the
 
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.250 align:start position:0%
and those expenses are billed to the
fund

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
with regard to your question about
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
whether the the costs of say 2.9 Million
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
dollars plus 350 000 equaling 3.2
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
million dollars in in expenses compared
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
to roughly 4.9 million dollars in
 
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.569 align:start position:0%
to roughly 4.9 million dollars in
settlement

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
I would just note that I think by the
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
time we get to the end of the fiscal
 
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.150 align:start position:0%
time we get to the end of the fiscal
year

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that will be an
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
unusually high number because while
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
while we are at around 4.9 million
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
dollars in subtle cases right now
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
the process is really
 
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
I think just starting to get going it's
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
taken us a couple quarters I think to
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
really get up and running I don't want
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
to speak for the administrator and but
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
they've had to get their infrastructure
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
up and running we have close to 100
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
claims submitted now I expect by the end
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
of this fiscal year we are going to have
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
far more than 4.9 million dollars worth
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
of settlements and our 2.9 Million
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
Dollar request is ju is for this fiscal
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
year so through next June so I expect by
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
the time we get to next June
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be a much more
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
reasonable proportion uh because the 2.9
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
Million Dollars I'm requesting today we
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
haven't incurred that to date that's
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
just what we expect to incur
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
by the end of the fiscal year through
 
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.789 align:start position:0%
by the end of the fiscal year through
today

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
I would say we've incurred maybe a
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
couple hundred thousand dollars in
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
expenses for YDC so far this fiscal year
 
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
I just expect that by the time we get to
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
the end we'll be at 2.9 Million and does
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
that answer your question I apologize if
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
Amanda D at all versus Hassan
 
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:45.299 align:start position:0%
are they is there ongoing monitoring of
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
this I mean wasn't that a five-year
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
settlement that should have been
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
in our Rear View Mirror by now what when
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
are we going to get out of that so we
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
certainly were when we entered into that
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement hoping that all of
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
our obligations would be complete within
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
five years we continue to work towards
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
complying with all of the conditions in
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
that settlement agreement we engage
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
a lot with the plaintiffs in that case
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
frankly we just we still have work to do
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
work we're close but we continue to have
 
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:21.260 align:start position:0%
work to do and so until we have finally
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
achieved what we set out to under that
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement there work there
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
will continue to be monitoring there
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
will continue to be expenses associated
 
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.289 align:start position:0%
will continue to be expenses associated
um

00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
with the Community Mental Health
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
agreement I think covet has had
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
something to do with that so we were
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
already I think gonna go somewhat Beyond
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
five years covid has continued to impact
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
that but to answer your question yes the
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
original intent was to have wrapped that
 
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
up after five years
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
we just aren't there as a state I think
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
we continue to make progress and
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will wrap that up in the
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
coming years but we have not yet but we
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
continue to work on it we continue to
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
engage with with plaintiffs and I I
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for the plaintiffs
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
in that case and plaintiff's council
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
because they're not here today but
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm safe in saying everybody would agree
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
that we have good dialogue and we're all
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
continuing to work together to get to
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
Senator D'Alessandro and then
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr stupid I thank you attorney
 
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
general attorney general could you tell
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
me in reading of a report that I got
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
from the LBA I I felt a little difficult
 
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
to uh to figure out but how many cases
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
has has have you settled that that'd be
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice versus how
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
many cases has the administrative
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
settled and what's the what's the dollar
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
amount that's been pushed out the door
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
as we speak in terms of settled clips
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
so we have settled I believe nine cases
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
total because we had one in the first
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
quarter we had we had eight in the
 
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.070 align:start position:0%
quarter we had we had eight in the
second

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
we've had the first proceeding in front
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the administrator so I expect we'll
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
get a decision from the administrator at
 
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
um the way it's set up is that if we can
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
reach a settlement with the claimant
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
without needing to go to the
 
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
administrator then then we settle the
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
case if we don't reach an agreement
 
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
claims will go for an administrative
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
proceeding I don't know exactly how many
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings have been scheduled now but
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
there's a number of proceedings that
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
have been scheduled so we've settled
 
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:35.660 align:start position:0%
nine I don't believe we have not had any
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
resolutions decided by the administrator
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
but I expect we'll start to see those in
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
quarter three
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
and about
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
I think the the settlement amount total
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
is about 4.8 4.9 million dollars
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
of that I think 2.9 has gone out 2.9
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
Million has actually gone out the door
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
but the remaining amount is just still
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
being processed further questions
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
what has it cost us in order to do this
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I noticed that the 350 000 was
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
was a cost that you have you have
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
determined comes out of the fund and the
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
administrator has costs that come out of
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
so that is outlined in the
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
administrator's report we have had about
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
we expect we've incurred about 350
 
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.830 align:start position:0%
we expect we've incurred about 350
000

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
and again I don't want to speak for the
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
administrator but let me see if I can
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
several hundred thousand I think would
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
be I think I'm accurate if I say that
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's several hundred thousand so
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
you know 4.9 million dollars in
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
settlements we have I mean it's less
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars in expenses it's
 
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.909 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars in expenses it's
it's

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
um well under a million dollars and I
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
expect that that Gap will continue to
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
grow as because we've had some startup
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
costs to get the fund going
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
for the Christmas Jim follow-up so in
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
terms of time constraints you know the
 
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:21.980 align:start position:0%
the time is is passing rather quickly
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
and the time left is really quite
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
dividibous when you think of it right we
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
have about a year
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
left it to settle all of these cases
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
there's there's a year a year and a half
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
closer to the the deadline is December
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
31st 2024 but
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
um yeah we're certainly cognizant of
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that time is precious and and like
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
I said I think it's it's taken some time
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
for us to get it up and running we've
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
had good conversations with the
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
administrator we continue to refine
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
things he'll have they'll have some
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
things to present to you today
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
um close to 100 claims have been
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
submitted and I think that as we get
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
further into the two-year period we can
 
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
I think we're probably a little too
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
early to know whether we're behind
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
schedule or ahead of schedule
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't last question follow-up and
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
and how many how many of these cases are
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
are choosing the other methodology Court
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
at this point in time so right now we
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
and this requires a little parsing there
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
there is a cons there's a consult
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're all Consolidated there's over a
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
thousand cases right over a thousand
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
cases have been filed in the
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
Consolidated litigation now some of
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
those cases are not cases that we would
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
think of as YDC cases because judge
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
showman decided to include cases that
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
don't involve claims from events that
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
happened in YDC but involve claims for
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
individuals who are
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
um alleging abuse while they were in
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
foster care and some other placement
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
but right now in in that Consolidated
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
Consolidated litigation there's over a
 
00:23:54.529 --> 00:23:54.539 align:start position:0%
thousand cases
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
probably at least a couple hundred if
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
not more of those are not what I would
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
call YDC cases so to answer your
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
question right now we have about 100
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
claims submitted in the claim fund
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
there are you know probably seven seven
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
hundred or so
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
that's just a very rough estimate that
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
are in court there's some overlap
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
between those because you can file a kit
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
you can bring a lawsuit and then stay it
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
while you try the claims fund but I
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
think to answer your question we have
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
about 100 claims in the claims fund
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
they're about 700 700 to 800 YDC cases
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
in court
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
of course our hope is that we we
 
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
continue to have that the court number
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
go down and the claims number fund
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
number go up I think will still remains
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
to be seen the progress we can make with
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
that but we I would say I'm I'm
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
optimistic at this point but we have
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
work to do that that's for sure
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you Mr chip
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question uh
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh good seeing you um
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mr attorney general I say um i i i the
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
way this law got put together the AG's
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
office did great work in drafting
 
00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:12.419 align:start position:0%
something that was brought to the
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
legislature the legislature then in a in
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
a committee process worked with you to
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
improve upon it and tweak it or at least
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
we thought we were improving upon it so
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
so now that we've we've tried this new
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
law that was unique in the nation
 
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh are are there things that you're
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
seeing that might cause us to want to go
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
back and tweak the litigation to because
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
we've learned something we're smarter
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
than what we were now I I don't think we
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
want to change the rules of the game now
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
that it's gotten started and we take
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
something fairly powerful but are you
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
are you are you seeing the law as being
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
um pretty stable pretty good or did did
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
we miss something we need to come back
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
and try to fix
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question representative
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I know the the administrator will
 
00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
have thoughts on this too I think
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
I think it's been pretty good we did
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
have a couple of changes that the
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
administrator suggested in the last
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
session that we thought were good ones
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
and and that the legislature made
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
regarding changing some terminology and
 
00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:21.169 align:start position:0%
regarding changing some terminology and
and

00:26:21.169 --> 00:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:21.950 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
and moving the waiver to the end of the
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
process I think that we're likely to
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
identify additional tweaks that might be
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
good ideas as we sit here today I think
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
it's working pretty well the
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
administrator has a couple of
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
suggestions in his letter that we'll
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
talk we expect to talk more about with
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
with him not the changes that are
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
actually before you today but he has a
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
couple of additional observations that
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
we expect we'll talk with the
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
administrator and his team about and
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know we probably as we go now into
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
quarter three and quarter four
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be surprised if we identify
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
additional changes that might be a good
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
idea say going into the 2024 session but
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
I but overall I would answer a question
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
to say I think it's working pretty well
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
but I think now that we have a hundred
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
claims in
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
over the next few months we're going to
 
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.049 align:start position:0%
over the next few months we're going to
get

00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
better a better set of data to evaluate
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know what what additional changes
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
might might be a good idea
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
I read in the administrators report that
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
The Proposal so far could represent 82
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.390 align:start position:0%
million dollars
and

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned with months to go more
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
more and more people coming in
 
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.409 align:start position:0%
more and more people coming in
um

00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
about whether we exceed that 100 million
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
now you have the options I guess
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
some of this money is if there's a
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
payout it might go over 10 years right
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
so we don't spend all this money up
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
front in the first biennium that's a
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
potential option but that comes down to
 
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
an election by the claimant so it's it's
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
difficult to predict what portion of
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
that might get paid out over time or
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
what portion might be paid out in a lump
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
sum I thought it was traditional that
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
you just don't pay it all out at once
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
no it it's an option but and we I
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
remember we had this discussion during
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
the legislative process we ultimately
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
decided at least for now you know in
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
this this iteration of the process to
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
have it be the option of of the claimant
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
we've only had again we've only had nine
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
settlements and so we don't I don't
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
think we have enough of a data set right
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
now to predict what percentage will get
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
paid out over time but to your point Mr
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
chairman about the 82 million total
 
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.029 align:start position:0%
chairman about the 82 million total
requests

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
that's what's requested I can tell you
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
so far our experience has been is that
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're often settling or paying out
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
amounts that are below the initial
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
request and so again I think
 
00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
we'll have better data in a few months
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
to tell you you know what we're on track
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
for but the total amount requested
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
is not not necessarily a good barometer
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the total amount that will be paid
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
out on those on those claims
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of of the crimes
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's likely to be no Witnesses nothing
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
written down didn't tell people
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
kept its secret private whatever so
 
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
and we're using lie detector on any of
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
these people that you know it comes in
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's nothing supported but
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
your word
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
so is that become a routine to use a lie
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
detector otherwise we have we don't have
 
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.549 align:start position:0%
detector otherwise we have we don't have
corroboration

00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
corroboration
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
we certainly we wouldn't use a a
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
polygraph or any type of lie detector
 
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.310 align:start position:0%
polygraph or any type of lie detector
test

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
we really try to treat each claim in
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
each individual as
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
as a as its own claim its own set of
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
facts its own set of circumstances
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
some claimants in working with their
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys will will submit a a
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
investigator report because they will
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
have it voluntarily sat down with an
 
00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
investigator and they'll tell us about
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
that investigator and so that we can
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
assess their reputation some claimants
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
may take a different approach
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately if if we can't reach a
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
resolution it will go to a proceeding in
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
front of the administrator and the
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
administrator and his team and again I
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them but they've
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
put a lot of thought and work into how
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
they're going to handle the
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
administrative uh the any administrative
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding but we we wouldn't use a
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
polygraph or a lie detector test but I
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
think we're all putting a lot of thought
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
into for any individual claim you know
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we assess it and it's
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to paint you know to really
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
use any broad brush with which to paint
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
these claims because I you know I can't
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
get any into any specific claim of
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
course but I can tell you based on what
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
I've seen
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
there you know there are different
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
circumstances and different facts that
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
go with with each of these claims in
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
each of these individuals these claims
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
span decades there's going to be
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
differences in what records are
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
available and differences in what
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
corroboration there might be as far as
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
who we could who we could even hope to
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
to talk to given that these events
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
happen happened decades ago so
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
um that's I think the best I can tell
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
you is we we have put a lot of thought
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
and I know the administrator and his
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
team have put a lot of thought into the
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
need to balance the need to assess these
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
claims objectively while respecting the
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
individual victims that that bring
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
forward these claims and that really
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
requires uh a determination on a
 
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:48.380 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis as to what type of
 
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
verification methods we're going to
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
undertake do we even have the capability
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
given a date
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
to find out if that person was in fact
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in one of those
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
institutions and if a employee is named
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
to find out if that employee was
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
employed in that institution do we have
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
that record that we can at least verify
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
those things yes we generally do have
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
records to verify that that a um a
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
claimant would have been a resident at
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
YDC at the time and that if a
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
perpetrator is named they would have
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
been employed at the time is important
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
to remember that sometimes if someone
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
was 13 12 13 years old and they were a
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
victim and it's decades ago they may not
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
remember a name they may be able to
 
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
describe the person they may not have
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
memory of a name
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
General there was one claim that was
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
settled for the max of the 1.5 million
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
my question is there seems to be a a
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion between those
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
representing the claimant uh
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
is that is that still in the litigation
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
or what's the story though or has a has
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
the Cleveland paid to to the individual
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
that's the first question and secondly
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
the the two parties that are involved
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
the original group of lawyers that
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
represented him versus the settlement
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
what's the story how how is that uh
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
how's that handled
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I believe that claim has been paid as
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know there is a dispute between
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
between attorneys involved over over
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
um entitlement to fees yes that
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
that is uh that is litigation that's
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
going to play out between the parties
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
the the parties the attorneys in in the
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
case I believe there's a court I believe
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
they have a court date scheduled for
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
later in August they have a hearing but
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
um that's really not something we will
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
involve ourselves in good food that's
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
that's really what I wanted to do we
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
would have no involvement at this point
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
in time the claim has been settled
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
everything else is the responsibility of
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
the parties involved correct okay thank
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
anything further for the Attorney
 
00:34:06.659 --> 00:34:08.329 align:start position:0%
anything further for the Attorney
General

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
we'll ask administrative Roderick to add
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
any cogent information and some of you
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
may have questions for him thank you
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I could there's a pending
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt the litigation portion
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh Senator gray and Senator bird cell
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
that's 23205. yeah I understand that it
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
just I guess
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the piece that the administrator
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
would comment is over and above that so
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
we do have a motion in a second so any
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion on that specific
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
motion to give them the litigation
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
expenses requested
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none all in favor say aye aye
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
opposed no that motion is adopted
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
administrator if you would like to make
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
any further comments on these litigation
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
expenses we will come later to an item
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
that you have that we may have further
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.810 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:13.820 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh would it be appropriate for me to say
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
five minutes and give you an overview of
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
where I see things
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
yes it would now first of all I I want
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
to say at the outset that
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and the Attorney
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
General's office has been
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
collaborative and cooperative
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm an independent operation as the
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
statute defines and I am independent
 
00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
my assessment of where we are now
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
is this legislature in my view
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
did exactly the right thing when you
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
establish this fund
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this work now for eight
 
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.349 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this work now for eight
months

00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
and over that time I've had a chance to
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
read a number of files that have come
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
into our office and are transported the
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
those files are confidential
 
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:21.500 align:start position:0%
the impact those files make on you
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
is significant
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's important people understand
 
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.630 align:start position:0%
I think it's important people understand
that

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:29.099 align:start position:0%
most of the people coming into the
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
system are over 50 years of age what
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
happened to them happened 30 plus years
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
ago sometimes longer
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
they were kids
 
00:36:42.609 --> 00:36:42.619 align:start position:0%
and their memories are not
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
photographic nor should they expect it
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office has been
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
handling these claims
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
and until my office thanks to an
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
amendment here
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
allowed the administrator
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
to hold a hearing without requiring
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
people to waive their rights against the
 
00:37:05.579 --> 00:37:07.130 align:start position:0%
people to waive their rights against the
state

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
once that happened we're starting to see
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
more requests
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
for de novo review not that the Attorney
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
General's den of review was incorrect
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that but they want to
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
give it one more bite of the apple with
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
my office
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
and so we are at the front of that right
 
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.050 align:start position:0%
and so we are at the front of that right
now

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so I appreciate the fact the
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislature made that change
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
but let me give you some Global issues
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
that I think all of us need to focus on
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we need to change but I
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
think we need to acknowledge it
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
under the statute my office
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to accept any claims from
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
any person
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
the window closes we can process claims
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
that have been submitted before them but
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
we can't take new claims
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
the first trial to my knowledge is
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
scheduled in the Superior Court
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
by a YDC claimant will be April of 2024.
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know how the court system is
 
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
going to deal with that
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
I read recently the Court's thinking
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
maybe they can bundle these cases 10 at
 
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:27.140 align:start position:0%
a time
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not casting a judgment on that I
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
think that would be difficult
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
in any event by the end of December of
 
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
the 800 or 1000 cases the Attorney
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
General mentioned to you
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
will not have been resolved in the
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
unless those folks file those cases also
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
in our administrative process
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
once the end of December next year comes
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
they'll have only one option which is to
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
go to court
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
the purpose I think of what the
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislature did not commend it is to see
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not a confidential process
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
not a jury trial I'm familiar with those
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
a confidential process it's trauma
 
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.130 align:start position:0%
a confidential process it's trauma
informed

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
informed
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and victim-centered would attract people
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
I think it's attracting people to come
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
maybe not at the pace we all hope
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
but I do think the pace will increase
 
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
will it increase by the end of next year
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
to Encompass almost all of those
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
thousand cases I think the jury is still
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's important that
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
we look at what's happening we determine
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
if we're okay with that
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
or whether any changes need to be made
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
to hasten the migration of cases from
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
the spiritual docket
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
to this process
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
that is a policy question way above my
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
pay grade
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
but it is a policy question that's
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this committee
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
and what might be done
 
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
to change the rate at which cases are
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
migrating and right now most of the
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
cases we're receiving by the way
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
are not in the Superior Court
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
they're coming in from other sources
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
most of them have lawyers not all of
 
00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:32.630 align:start position:0%
most of them have lawyers not all of
them

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
but there is a reluctance I think
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
to come into the system at the level
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
that all of us think maybe would be
 
00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:42.770 align:start position:0%
that all of us think maybe would be
appropriate

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
and so we are designing so you
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
understand we're designing our operation
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
to accommodate all of those cases I I
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
can't prepare for the flood after the
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
the water is rising
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
so we are preparing for success
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're over preparing
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen but I can't do it at
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
the last minute
 
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
the last minute
um

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
we had our first hearing as an
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
administrator a de novo hearing with a
 
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.950 align:start position:0%
administrator a de novo hearing with a
claimant

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
claimant
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
within the last 10 days
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
I had two meetings today with claimants
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
and their Council and the Attorney
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
General's office so it's good to see
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
that's happening
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
but if it continues at that pace
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
in a year and a half I'll be saying well
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
we we tried but we didn't get there
 
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh and again that's not my call
 
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
but I I will say this to you in the
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
cases that I've read and I've read a
 
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
number of them who've come to us
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's pretty disturbing what I'm reading
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I remind myself all the time these
 
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
are children
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
these are children who had nothing to do
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
with the physical or sexual abuse I'm
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
reading about
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
I also know and believe that it's
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
probably not in their interest these
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
kids now full adults
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
to wait three or four years longer
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
to walk into a Superior Courthouse
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
and take an oath and testify in front of
 
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.589 align:start position:0%
and take an oath and testify in front of
jurors

00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
we have designed this process as I think
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
you intended
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like a superior court
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
case it doesn't feel like a spiritual
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
case and I am not acting like a judge
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator I have only the
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
authority you give me
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
but one thing we did do we went out and
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
retained on a Consulting basis
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
some trauma-informed folks
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
one individual worked for years with the
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
police department investigating sexual
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
and physical abuse claims she's
 
00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:00.170 align:start position:0%
and physical abuse claims she's
extraordinary

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:02.099 align:start position:0%
and we have another person who all of
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
you would know who's also on that same
 
00:43:04.619 --> 00:43:05.690 align:start position:0%
you would know who's also on that same
page

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
and when we had the first hearing
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago now the questioning was
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
done through that person of the claimant
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
not by me
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
when she finished I had a few questions
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
I asked them
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to their
 
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.670 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to their
credit

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
and the claimants Council to their
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
credits and we don't need to be in the
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
room we'll be in another room
 
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
and you'll show it to us on video but
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be in the room and
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
they've been very willing to let me or
 
00:43:37.089 --> 00:43:37.099 align:start position:0%
my expert
 
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:39.500 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed expert ask the questions
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
it becomes like a conversation it's not
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
a deposition
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
so the system that you've designed I
 
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
think you designed it beautifully I
 
00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:51.859 align:start position:0%
commence you for it I mean that
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
whether its current configuration
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
and resources are adequate for what you
 
00:43:59.809 --> 00:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
hope to accomplish
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
I have some thoughts on that
 
00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:03.589 align:start position:0%
I have some thoughts on that
but

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
again it's not my call
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that the system is up
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
and running the Attorney General's
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
office is trying to level best I I
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
believe they are I believe my office is
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
doing the level best sitting to my right
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
is John Foley
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
who had the misfortune apparently of
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
clerking for me for a decade when I was
 
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
on the Supreme Court so she's the bright
 
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.609 align:start position:0%
on the Supreme Court so she's the bright
one

00:44:30.609 --> 00:44:30.619 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
but anyway I was able to get her out of
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
a very secure job
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
there's no small task to come and serve
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
as general counsel
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
we have two paralegals in our office
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
to help us process
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
we need to have technology to do the job
 
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.690 align:start position:0%
we need to have technology to do the job
well

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
we now have about 125 filings as opposed
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
to 92
 
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
and maybe by the end of this quarter
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
we'll have 150.
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to mention and I
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
don't know whether will happen or not
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
but I practice law for a lot of years so
 
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
I know what I would have done
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
all these cases that are in the Superior
 
00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:14.450 align:start position:0%
all these cases that are in the Superior
Court

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:17.900 align:start position:0%
if if counsel for those claimants
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
decides December 31st next year not to
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
file anything with us
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
the only route those claimants will have
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
is a jury trial
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
maybe two years hence maybe three years
 
00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:31.790 align:start position:0%
maybe two years hence maybe three years
hence

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
hence
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
a jury trial having tried many of them
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
myself is a very different experience
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have a
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed expert ask you the
 
00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:43.970 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed expert ask you the
questions

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is I don't want to say
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
expectation but my hope is
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
that before December 31 2024
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of those cases currently on the
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
docket in the Superior Court while
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
they'll still remain there
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
will also file a claim with us
 
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
because there's no downside to filing a
 
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
claim unless there's no Prejudice thanks
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
to your amendment I can get involved and
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
get my uniform dirty if they don't like
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
what I say they can stay in court
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
if that happens
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
if that happens
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to process those
 
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.150 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to process those
claims

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
because of the people filing them with
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
us will be a year or two or longer away
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
from a jury trial
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
and we don't take a year or two to get
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
the claim to the point where we're ready
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
that would be an enormous undertaking
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're preparing for that I'm not
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
complaining we're preparing for it
 
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:51.140 align:start position:0%
because I think it's wise to assume that
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
if this legislature wanted to ensure
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
that more claims would file more quickly
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
and be happy to be in our system
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
I think there are some changes that
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
could be made again not my call so we
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
are doing our level best I can assure
 
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:08.750 align:start position:0%
are doing our level best I can assure
you

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
with our staffing with our trauma
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
informed experts the Attorney General's
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
office has been very competent and very
 
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
office has been very competent and very
cooperative

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:20.060 align:start position:0%
and so I'm optimistic about where we are
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm not overly optimistic about
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
whether people are going to come see us
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
because the window is closing
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
or whether they're going to come see us
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
because they think they should
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you administrative questions from
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you for
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
stepping forward into this critical role
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
it's thank you very much I you've you've
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
left me wanting to to know the rest of
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
the story you're saying you have things
 
00:47:55.569 --> 00:47:55.579 align:start position:0%
that you think we ought to be doing to
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
modify the the existing law to help us
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
move these cases to you but you're not
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
enumerating them with us today so that's
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
fine I I'm just I just would like to
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
know what process you or the Attorney
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
General are using to work with the mem a
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
member of the legislature to begin
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
consideration of these changes
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm a process guy I want to make sure
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
you got a process the process as
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
designed is fine
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's not going to be the process that
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
my sense is this
 
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of the claims that are out there
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
would be very appropriately handled in
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
the process you've designed with the
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
capture put in place
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's true
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to apply to every
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
case that's out there
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
and the question I would have were I a
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
policy maker
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
is what is the overall goal here
 
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:15.500 align:start position:0%
is the goal to have some of these cases
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
migrate to this process and then close
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
the window and try all the rest
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
where's the goal to get as many of those
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
cases possible to migrate to this
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
process so that what's left is not going
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
to be great
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
I was a trial lawyer for 22 years so I
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
know what trying cases feels like I know
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
how expensive it is
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
and the Attorney General's officers have
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
said is
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
highly competent so I know that too
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be expensive it's
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
going to be expensive think about trying
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
800 or a thousand cases to a jury
 
00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not the chief justice but I would
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
lie a weeknights wondering how it's
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
going to accommodate that onslaught
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
if I were the Attorney General's office
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'd say how can we try 800 cases
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
if I were the plaintiff's council the
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
claimants challenge so I'd say how are
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
we going to do that
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
how are we going to be standing when
 
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
it's over
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
as those calculations be made
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of the funds you
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
created was to help these kids now
 
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:29.060 align:start position:0%
adults who through no fault of their own
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
were sexually and physically abused
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
so if I were
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting a change may be premature but
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think so
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at the amount of the claims
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
file the gross amount that's being
 
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
sought already for 92 claims
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's 82 million dollars
 
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
you can do the math on the dancer Clans
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's worth 82 million
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has settled I think
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
eight cases we're not involved
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
they said late cases I think for 4.8
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
so it's not as if trying these cases in
 
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
the superior court it's going to be less
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
expensive or get you a result that may
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
cost the state less
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
so if I were looking at this
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
holistically again I'm at the front end
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
I would think maybe
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars is not going to do
 
00:51:37.079 --> 00:51:38.030 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars is not going to do
it

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:51:40.569 --> 00:51:40.579 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to look at that
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
maybe in extreme circumstances not the
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
average circumstance as bad as they are
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
I might look at the caps and say in
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
exceptional circumstances the Attorney
 
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
General's office in the first instance
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
would have the capacity to go up to this
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
number for a cap
 
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't end there they can
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
come see me but I can't go about that
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
cap either those would be for the
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
exceptional circumstances as defined by
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
this legislature
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the cases
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
the Caps I think
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
are fair
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
I mean whether they're appropriate I
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't know but they're reasonable I
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how to compensate someone for
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
that but you've got to pick a number
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I think this legislature
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
to this level best to do that I applaud
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
you for it
 
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
but if you want more cases to come
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
you've got to raise the caps on the on
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
the most extreme cases and I honestly
 
00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:41.930 align:start position:0%
the most extreme cases and I honestly
believe

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
not today but you need to consider
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
putting more money in that fund
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
the money that you put in the plan isn't
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
being spent unless people come to seek
 
00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.670 align:start position:0%
being spent unless people come to seek
it

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
but it will be spent if the Attorney
 
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
General of this state and his office has
 
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:00.020 align:start position:0%
to prepare and try
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of cases
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
and it will cost that you cherish some
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
money too that that's not in their
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
budget and that's my guess
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
so I I think those changes would be
 
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.589 align:start position:0%
so I I think those changes would be
helpful

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
and I think it would matter and the
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
question I think is not whether
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
more money would help
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
but when you decide it should be
 
00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:26.270 align:start position:0%
but when you decide it should be
allocated

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying today you need to do it
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the math and the
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
quarter two report
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
you look at the cases the attorney
 
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
general has settled
 
00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
I think you can see that you're quickly
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
going to get to a number that
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
probably won't do it
 
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what I think
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
Senator gray for a question
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
uh actually it's not a question it's a
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
suggestion to you Mr chair most of this
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
conversation we've had is probably more
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the last item in tab 13
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
which is the informational item right
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
now I'm respecting the rest of the
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
people that are here in their time I
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
would like to go back to tab nine and
 
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.930 align:start position:0%
would like to go back to tab nine and
move

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.030 align:start position:0%
move
um

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.650 align:start position:0%
um
23

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:11.660 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
247 which is the uh adjustment or or the
 
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
claims process for the administrative
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
settlement the updates that were
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
provided to us and I believe that those
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
are appropriate and should be adopted
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is the item nine and you might add
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
to your emotion that any future
 
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
Corrections or to language spelling Etc
 
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
be freely made without coming back to us
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
so if there's anything I certainly would
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
add that all right so that will be part
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
of that motion that any further minor
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
changes can be made at the discretion of
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
the administrator they don't change the
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
sum the meaning of what what is in the
 
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.609 align:start position:0%
sum the meaning of what what is in the
piece

00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
on item nine yes I would second it but I
 
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
motion is made and seconded thank you
 
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
sir representative Senator there are a
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
couple typos
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
in here all right I can't hear a couple
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
of typos
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
in the the 90 Pages the 90 pages that
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
you sent us but my question is have you
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
seen the letter with two suggestions
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
from the association for justice
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
they made two discrete suggestions one
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
is that where you say the forms are
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
developed by the Attorney General
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be that we would add with
 
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
Consulting the claimants Council
 
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
and the second suggestion is that there
 
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
be a digital claims packet available
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
guess I'd like to know what your
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
um comments on those two suggestions
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:08.809 align:start position:0%
might be
good

00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
hi so your first the first suggestion
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that claims council is
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
consulted uh with respect to forms I
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
mean we we have done that in terms of I
 
00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:23.579 align:start position:0%
think by Statute anytime the the
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
administrator has to uh bring
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
suggestions that that's something we
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
bring to both the attorney general and
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
claims Council so I mean I'm not sure
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
what the Attorney General would think
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
about it but we would see that as just
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
part of built into what is kind of
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
already already out there in terms of
 
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
making sure everybody has an opportunity
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
to see changes or to see suggestions so
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
I I don't see an issue with it I don't
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
know if the Attorney General's office
 
00:56:49.559 --> 00:56:51.109 align:start position:0%
know if the Attorney General's office
would

00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the second digital claims
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
packet we've been asked about that um
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
several times it is something we we want
 
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
to do it really is about
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
um you know the resources that where
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
we're putting staff resources on what
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
items we're actually in conversation
 
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
with a particular consultant
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
um with to to maybe go under contracts
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
to have a much more automated system and
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
the digital form packet would be a part
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
of an automated system I think given the
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
volume that we expect to have we need to
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
have something that's automated and
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
those are conversations I've been having
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general designee as
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
well and we would definitely involve
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
claims Council make sure that such a
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
process an automated process would be
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
working for everyone not just our staff
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to add one thing
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
we have met on two occasions one in
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
April and one in June
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
with all defense Council all climate
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
Council uh Jennifer Ramsey the Attorney
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
General's officers Ben the last meeting
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
was very constructive we had the
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed people that we've
 
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:00.500 align:start position:0%
retained and they were there and present
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's been very open I mean I I
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
don't think any claimant consequence say
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
to you that these people aren't
 
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.069 align:start position:0%
to you that these people aren't
listening

00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
listening
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
and Jennifer Ramsey who is the point
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
person in that office on this process
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
has come to those meetings who
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
participates fully in those meetings uh
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
I think the Attorney General's office is
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
interested in suggestions I don't have
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
any sense or not
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
so it's uh
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's early people are trying to figure
 
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:33.380 align:start position:0%
out who we are what are we really about
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
so I I think you know we're going to
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
build that image hopefully it'll be
 
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.010 align:start position:0%
build that image hopefully it'll be
successful

00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
but I also want to say on this record I
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
think the Attorney General's office has
 
00:58:44.339 --> 00:58:45.549 align:start position:0%
think the Attorney General's office has
been

00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
you're very diligent and thoughtful in
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
what they're doing
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
so there's no bad person in the equation
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
my fear is that
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
however you define success
 
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
what does that look like
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
and if the window closes on this process
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
in a year and five months
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
and 700 cases remain in the Superior
 
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.130 align:start position:0%
and 700 cases remain in the Superior
Court

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
is that why you did this
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
and if it's not why you did it what
 
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:18.740 align:start position:0%
changes can you make now 17 months out
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
that my my grades Association is far
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
more quickly that's that's not my call
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I I think how you define success
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none the question before us is to
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
approve item nine with the addition to
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
make any other minor changes that would
 
00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:47.180 align:start position:0%
be administrative finds necessary
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Mr chairman members of

the committee not only do you have
 
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
someone from the office of the consumer

Advocate you have the consumer advocate
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Donald crease
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
and I've served as consumer Advocates
 
01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
since early 2016. our office represents
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
the interests of residential utility
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
customers at the puc just by way of
 
01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
briefly introducing this item to you
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are currently two major rate cases
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
pending at the Public Utilities
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
Commission and I expect as many as one
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
or two more to be filed next year the
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
fundamental task in a rate case is for
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
the puc to decide what the annual
 
01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement of a utility is
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's basically how much money the
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
utility should take in in total from all
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
of its customers the annual revenue
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
requirement is itself a sum of two
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
numbers the first number is the
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
utilities operating costs that's pretty
 
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
straightforward the second number is a
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
return on the company's investment and
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
we derive that number by taking
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
basically the present value of all the
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
capital assets the utility has in
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
service and we multiply that by the
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
utilities cost of capital the cost of
 
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
capital is a blended average of
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
basically how much money the utility
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
owes its lenders because they borrow
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
about half of their capital resources
 
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
from lenders and the other half is a
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
return on Equity that is basically what
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
the shareholders of the company are
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
entitled to earn in exchange for them
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
having made their investment item number
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
11 asks your permission to hire an
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
outside expert to help us argue that the
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
return on Equity requested by the
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
utilities is too high this is a very
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
esoteric specialty I can think of only
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
three people in the entire State of New
 
01:04:58.609 --> 01:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who would be qualified to
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
testify as an expert on this subject one
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
of them is now a member of the Public
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the second one is
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
the head of the Department of Energy's
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
regulatory Support Division and the
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
third happens to be the president of
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
Unitil one of our utilities and boy am I
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
glad he has that job now because he is
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
out of this game and he was a formidable
 
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
expert witness for utilities back when
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
he was doing that for a living so we put
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
out an RFP our office is presently
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
understaffed so we had to put out an RFP
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
for a variety of forms of assistance in
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
rape cases and I believe at your next
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
meeting I'll be back with a different
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
contract that covers different stuff but
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
in this instance the expert that we
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
decided to hire is a gentleman from
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
Connecticut who submitted a bid to us we
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
were impressed because of some excellent
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
work he did on a similar rate case down
 
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut so that's the reason I'm
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
here our statute allows us to supplement
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
our Resources by a special assessment
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
but in order to do that we need the
 
01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:03.059 align:start position:0%
permission of both the governor and
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
Council and your permission
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
We snuck into the governor in Council
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
and got their permission ahead of yours
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
and now the matter is pending before you
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:18.859 align:start position:0%
I agree for most true proof second
 
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
motion and a second to approve the
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
request further discussion
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question all in
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%

01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
oh the late item thank you very much the
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
we see before us
 
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.089 align:start position:0%
we see before us
um

01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
so who's here from dot I see I think
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the recommendation came down from
 
01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.089 align:start position:0%
and the recommendation came down from
the

01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
executive Council to buy rather than
 
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
lease so we'll hear about that
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman Wyler for

01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
brief summary we have um
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years we have leased
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
loaded backhoes to um
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh working our Patrol uh Patrol sections
 
01:07:29.809 --> 01:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
loading trucks loading salt for the
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
winter and and uh doing summer work of
 
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.430 align:start position:0%
winter and and uh doing summer work of
um

01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
ditching and Hauling and so forth but um
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh at the last council meeting as we
 
01:07:41.529 --> 01:07:41.539 align:start position:0%
brought forward this this third
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
iteration of a five-year lease uh the
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
executive Council asked us to do an
 
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
analysis of uh of buying versus uh
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
leasing the analysis showed a
 
01:07:52.609 --> 01:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
substantial savings to the state over
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
the five years of the lease
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
and they had uh subsequently uh voted
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
down the lease item and recommended us
 
01:08:04.809 --> 01:08:04.819 align:start position:0%
to uh proceed with the with the purchase
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that purchase we are here
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
to uh fiscal
 
01:08:10.079 --> 01:08:10.670 align:start position:0%
to uh fiscal
um

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
seeking a transfer from the highway
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
Surplus account to facilitate that that
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
purchase so the costs are more than in
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
our budget for this biennium but over
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
the five years of the lease and the
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
analysis is there I can answer any
 
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
questions to that there is a
 
01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:27.650 align:start position:0%
questions to that there is a
um

01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
substantial savings and overall Savings
 
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
of uh about approximately five million
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
dollars to the state so we'd ask your
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
entertainment to
 
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.630 align:start position:0%
entertainment to
um

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%

uh transfer about 4.8 million dollars
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
from the highway uh from the highway
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
fund to support the lease I mean support
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%

if she'll take it okay that'll likely be
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
on the that would be most relevant to
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
Lori Weaver commissioner no interim
 
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:58.330 align:start position:0%
Lori Weaver commissioner no interim
commissioner

01:09:58.330 --> 01:09:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
congratulations thank you and Marissa
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
my question is based on the news story
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
from the other day about these two
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
teenage boys
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
who were placed in residential treatment
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee and are being
 
01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.770 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee and are being
traumatized

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
traumatized
 
01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:22.669 align:start position:0%
traumatized
um

01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
I guess we can't use the word abused but
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
the child advocate suggested a month ago
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
that they'd be brought back to New
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so I have a two-part
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
question one is when are we going to get
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
these two boys here and two are they
 
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.169 align:start position:0%
these two boys here and two are they
possible

01:10:44.169 --> 01:10:44.179 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
Resonance of the prtf at Hampstead is
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
that level three is that the right
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
would that be a placement for them or
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
where we where are they going to go and
 
01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.590 align:start position:0%
where we where are they going to go and
when

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
sure so I'll take I'll start and if
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's anything you want to add in um I
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to tell you that as of just a
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
little while ago we can confirm that
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
they will both be arriving back in New
 
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire next week
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you and they actually will not be
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to the prtf that's a that's a
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
level five they were currently at a
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
level four so we have found appropriate
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
equivalent placement here in New
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
further questions on the dashboard
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
is there any further questions on the
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
informational items
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move on to
 
01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:42.500 align:start position:0%
the next meeting
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
September 15th is is kind of the
 
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
September 15th is is kind of the
traditional

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.530 align:start position:0%
traditional
Friday

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
is there a problem with the 10 o'clock
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
Time start
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
he may tell us about a problem not he is
 
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
I've committed to an event
 
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh at that thing at a local University
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
so it'll probably take you out for the
 
01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
whole day oh it starts at eight in the
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
morning and it goes through the day yes
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay so it doesn't matter when we meet
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
you won't be here that's correct thank
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
you Senator rosenmore it's Rosh Hashanah
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't see that that's probably not
 
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.390 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't see that that's probably not
appropriate

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right I didn't have that written
 
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.470 align:start position:0%
all right I didn't have that written
down

01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
it shows up on my calendar
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
oh no that's that musical band right it
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
moves around
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
and it's also Hispanic Heritage Month
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
begins well
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
there it is there it is it says Saturday
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
is the first day of Rosh Hashanah
 
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.410 align:start position:0%
is the first day of Rosh Hashanah
16.

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
16.
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
okay it's on my calendar for the 15th
 
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.390 align:start position:0%
okay it's on my calendar for the 15th
President

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
President
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
is Saturday the 16th but you say okay so
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
then it starts in the evening so in that
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
case it won't affect us it won't affect
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
Russia since it's September do it on a
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
Thursday as opposed to Friday
 
01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see a problem
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
because we won't be we won't be meeting
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
and it won't be all tied up in meetings
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
as Mr Kane see a problem
 
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
senator

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
said a request for the 14th yes is there
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay then
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
Senator representative Edwards uh yes
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
sir I just want to let you know that due
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
to uh surgery I I probably will be
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
unable to make any meeting until
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
December and so I'll need alternates
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
very good we always have very many
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
alternates that attend every meeting and
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
I'm delighted we have them and then we
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
always have use for them especially
 
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.930 align:start position:0%
always have use for them especially
today

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we will have a we will have an
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
alternate for
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.430 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
so

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.950 align:start position:0%
so
any

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to get back to
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
Justice Broderick
 
01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.030 align:start position:0%
Justice Broderick
well

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
did you have further questions for him I
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
did but we can have we can have the LBA
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
send the questions to him and have them
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
get back to all of us
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
um I I think it might be better actually
 
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.930 align:start position:0%
um I I think it might be better actually
given

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
this testimony that we asked him to come
 
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:15.380 align:start position:0%
back in September at our September and
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
the point I was going to make to him was
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh um I'm glad to hear the collaboration
 
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:24.140 align:start position:0%
between the Attorney General's office
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
and the administrator I think that's
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what
 
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.050 align:start position:0%
exactly what
um

01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know representative umberger's Bill
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
set up a couple of years ago
 
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
um the changes he's suggesting the
 
01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars the egregious cases
 
01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars the egregious cases
limits

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
limits
 
01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:44.030 align:start position:0%
limits
um

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
just just speaking for myself
 
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
that those of us that worked on that
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and the changes
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
that were made in hb2 we're going to
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
want to rely on the experts and I
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
wanted the attorney general and the
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
administrator to hear that because I
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
think the suggestions need to come to us
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
as opposed to us making the suggestions
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
to go to them good so
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
if you could politely ask them to come
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
back in September I'll reiterate that
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think it did support of of Senator
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
Bradley I think it was quite clear that
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator had some changes that
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
he thought would be appropriate in order
 
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
to expedite the process it the type
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
constraint is really what we're what
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and if something
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
could be done to expedite that and
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
expedite more people getting into the
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
queue I I think that will still have a
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
problem if I can I'm glad to see that
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
they're moving on the digital claims uh
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
anything that simplifies the process is
 
01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
going to expedite claims coming out of
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
the court and into the settlement
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
process so I think that's good and and I
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
do I'm glad to see that they are
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
communicating about the consultation
 
01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:08.219 align:start position:0%
between the council and
 
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
um the administrator too so
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's helpful but hopefully we get a
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
progress report on both of those in
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
um September yeah obviously there were
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
changes they're making continuously so
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
yeah it is good to have them back every
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
month this week so and if this is going
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
to go over 100 million dollars we want
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
to have exactly and we want to rely on
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
you know the people that have to settle
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
this for their best
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
estimates as to what we need to do I I
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to be and I don't think any
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
of us want to be you know blindly going
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
into the dark where we're talking about
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
as much resources as this could be so we
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
allowed we get a lot of questions from
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
our constituents
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
I think if we hear about changes in the
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
process that may expedite the hearings
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
that may have a positive effect on the
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
Abode yes you know we wouldn't have to
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
move the above if indeed these have done
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
it but I am I am surprised there's no
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
polygraph when there's no Witnesses no
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
corroboration of any kind you just tell
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
a story and you know
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
well I do have a suggestion
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
to slightly modify Senator Bradley's
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion and that is that I'd like to
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
see these vetted through the AG's office
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
when we got these suggestions during the
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance hearings there were
 
01:18:39.649 --> 01:18:39.659 align:start position:0%
things that the Attorney General
 
01:18:39.659 --> 01:18:41.030 align:start position:0%
things that the Attorney General
um

01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
did didn't especially like okay and so
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
to have that opportunity to have him go
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general and either
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
present a combined recommendation or the
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
recommendation and then the Attorney
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
General's response I think is going to
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
be much more helpful to us in trying to
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
make any decision so just my two cents
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
in that how that process should work
 
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
I was I was I was behind the the ball I
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
was thinking about the um
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
lie detector test that's not something
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
you commonly see in any kind of civil
 
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.709 align:start position:0%
you commonly see in any kind of civil
litigation

01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
besides it would it would it would
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
violate several several items in the
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
Constitution if you try to do it that
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
um all I was going to say is I totally
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
agree with uh Jim on what he just said
 
01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
that's why I said the spirit of
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration is really good and I would
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
hope that
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane in the minutes the this
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
conversation gets back both to Justice
 
01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
Broderick and to
 
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General yes I'll craft
 
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
an email to them
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
um I'll also send them the clip from
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
this meeting but I'll kind of give him
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
an idea of what the committee is looking
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
to hear in September had both of them
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
work together come back with suggested
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations since a lot of these are
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to require legislation you're
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
going to want to have that open
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
discussion here so you have a chance to
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
file but I can share that with them yes
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
yes haven't lost anything on your
 
01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.570 align:start position:0%
yes haven't lost anything on your
fastball

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.930 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
when you get a chance some content
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
contact information since we can't go
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
over to the corner office and find
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%

done knock on wood bye middle September

very good anything further from
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
