well

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure we have to see this
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
but input as long as there is not
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
accessed by a doom i know maybe
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
has not been able to participate because
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
he is mentally
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
ensure effective representation well i
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
feel sorry for the matter is overwhelmed
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
by durham but in terms of the senatorial
 
00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:56.389 align:start position:0%
by durham but in terms of the senatorial
district

00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
durham used to have a separate senate
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
and now uh
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
rebecca is doing a wonderful table job
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
but her district is not compact and she
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
has two very large
 
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.390 align:start position:0%
has two very large
democratic

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
democratic
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
democratic sisters
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
and durham and so i believe that that is
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
an example of partisan packing
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
and that there
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
is not real effective representation
 
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:26.949 align:start position:0%
is not real effective representation
of

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we have now 21 senate district 21
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%

the redistricting committee
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
i hope i will have time after the maps
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
are drawn to add my voice to the debate
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
accurate representation equals fair maps
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
being accurate is for the voters to
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
choose their representatives
 
00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:49.430 align:start position:0%
choose their representatives
not

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
for any political candidate to decide
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
their constituents
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
also being accurate is doing the job
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
elected to do
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
and following the constitution
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
when representatives are drawing maps to
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
pac districts they are not doing their
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
job packing i'm sure you know but the
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
act of grouping together members of one
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
group within a district to the point
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
that they are a super majority in that
 
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.230 align:start position:0%
that they are a super majority in that
district

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
this reduces the electoral influence of
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
the group in the surrounding districts
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
executive council district 2 is an
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
example of packing
 
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.270 align:start position:0%
example of packing
and

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%

all right
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%

um thank you for letting us address you
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
tonight my name is madeline desantis
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
wysocki i've lived in somersworth for 25
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
years and i'm here to encourage you to
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
both draw fair maps and to come and
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
visit us again after you have drawn said
 
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.990 align:start position:0%
visit us again after you have drawn said
maps

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
i recently learned that 10 years after
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
the last redistricting process the
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
public only had 24 hours to react to new
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
maps um and while i appreciate your
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
presence here tonight there is nothing
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
yet for the public to review or critique
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
except last year or last
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
cycles maps which we know um includes
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
more than one gerrymander
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
to really have a robust dialogue with
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
the public and one that creates the most
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
fair outcome i strongly encourage you to
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
return to these communities that you're
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
visiting after the maps have been drawn
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
for review
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
in summersworth specifically this is
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
important because our ward lines are
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
likely to be redrawn shortly after your
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
maps are drawn
 
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.350 align:start position:0%
maps are drawn
um

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
for example in somersworth ward 3 and
 
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.230 align:start position:0%
for example in somersworth ward 3 and
ward

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
ward
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
5 i think there's a 500 person
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
difference so
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
that will probably be adjusted in the
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
coming years
 
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.710 align:start position:0%
coming years
um

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh in particular also the executive
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
council as has been mentioned uh
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
district 2 is the greatest example of a
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
pac gerrymander
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
there are decisions happening at the
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
executive council level that directly
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
impact my life but my voice has been
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
deluded because the last redistricting
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
packed democrats into one district uh
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
that isn't just bad for one party or
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
another uh it hurts residents
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
somersworth has the same executive
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
counselor as westmoreland which is over
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
100 miles away and bordering vermont
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
while somersworth borders maine
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned i've lived in
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
summersworth for nearly 25 years i was
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
married in 2017. we bought a house in
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
2019 and soon we'll start a family i'm
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
not the only one somersworth is
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
experiencing a boom in young families
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
the next 10 years are going to be
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
pivotal for my life and so many other
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
young families and summers within our
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities i encourage this
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee to keep that in mind draw fair
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
maps and come back after those maps are
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
drawn and allow for public feedback
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
next up
 
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:12.170 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
good evening to the chair and uh
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is uh nate
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
stewart i live in dover new hampshire
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i've lived there since 1998. so i
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
was around
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
2010 during the last one of these i
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't at one of these meetings though
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
because i was very young
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that's something i'd like to
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
touch on a bit in my remarks here
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
is that i'd like to know uh
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
what potentially is being done to
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
include the youth of the state in
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh these sorts of considerations uh we
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
have a big issue with youth flight uh
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire a lot of our best and
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
brightest go elsewhere and i think a lot
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
of that is because a lot of people a are
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
being priced out of the state but b
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
don't feel like their government
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
represents them and doesn't feel like
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
they can have a voice so
 
00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:08.549 align:start position:0%
they can have a voice so
uh

00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
i would like to echo some of the
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about transparency
 
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
concerns about transparency
accessibility

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
accessibility
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
and uh the lack of having things to
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
really remark upon at these meetings
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a map so how can
 
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:24.870 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a map so how can
we

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
give our full like comments on the
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
process at this stage
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
communities

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
please respect the
 
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.350 align:start position:0%
please respect the
natural

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
natural
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
groupings that there are the school
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
districts and whatnot but until there's
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
a map that we can consider
 
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
a map that we can consider
like

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know what good that's going to
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
do and i don't know how specific my
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
remarks can be so i'd like to strongly
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
encourage these committees to come back
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
once you have a map and i'd very much
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
like to comment on it
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
another thing that i would like to say
 
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.669 align:start position:0%
another thing that i would like to say
is

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
please make sure that you respect
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
majority rule
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
and please make sure that the districts
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
that you develop
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
are reflective of uh
 
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.029 align:start position:0%
are reflective of uh
the

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
the
true

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
number of people there like if you have
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
one district which is like
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
wildly uh
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
partisan surrounded by a bunch of other
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
districts that are wildly partisan
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get an accurate
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
representation of the area it's better
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
neutral districts or districts again
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
that like
 
00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
that like
um

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:42.910 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.029 align:start position:0%
[Music]
are

00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
reflective of how things are and not
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered uh i feel like there's
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
been a general
 
00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
been a general
uh

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
decay in trust in government and trust
 
00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.350 align:start position:0%
decay in trust in government and trust
in

00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
in
uh

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:00.310 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.590 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
democracy and i feel like if majority
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
rule is undermined through
 
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.310 align:start position:0%
rule is undermined through
[Music]

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
districting maneuvers
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
that would only further that decline and
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately cause terminal harm to our
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
very republic i think you know most
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
people my generation most people in the
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
country at large aren't blind to the
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
fact that we just had uh not
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
a year ago an attempted coup in
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
washington and that sort of uh drastic
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh effect
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
comes from years of
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh systemic
 
00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh systemic
partisan

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
attacks on the very root of our
 
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.470 align:start position:0%
attacks on the very root of our
democracy

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
i don't trust the government i don't
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
think uh many people trust the
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
government which is why we need
 
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.389 align:start position:0%
transparency and
[Music]

00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
a real input instead of just being given
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
a microphone at a meeting that isn't
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
well advertised and is kind of out a
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
little bit in the middle of nowhere uh
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know can't access
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh the meeting's being recorded and i
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
know that the chair said that
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh it couldn't be on zoom because that's
 
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.230 align:start position:0%
uh it couldn't be on zoom because that's
the

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
ruling of the uh chair of the general
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
court right uh
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.140 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
that

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:38.150 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.750 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
we can't pass
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
the buck like
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
we need to recognize where deficiencies
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
are we need to recognize
 
00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.549 align:start position:0%
are we need to recognize
where

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:49.509 align:start position:0%
where
uh

00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
issues lay
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
i feel like accessibility is a big one
 
00:31:56.399 --> 00:31:57.350 align:start position:0%
i feel like accessibility is a big one
uh

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i guess that's about it i'll yield
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
thank you

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
my name is ivor freeman
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
i live in exeter
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
and i've come to ask you each of you
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
to look in the mirror every day
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
and ask the question
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
am i for democracy or am i for bias
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
because that is the really important
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
question for the population of this
 
00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:43.190 align:start position:0%
question for the population of this
state

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
and when you've decided that question
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
for transparency purposes you should
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
publicize it publicize it
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
it is really important that the people
 
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
it is really important that the people
know

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
what you stand for individually
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
and in transparency
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
you have to be
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
really clear
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
in what you stand for
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
and please
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
vote for democracy and not for bias
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
hello good evening my name is maggie
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
fogerty i live
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
at 16 florence street in dover where my
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
husband and i have owned a home for
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
about 23 and a half years
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
and as a first-time candidate for public
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
office i'm running for school board in
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
ward 1 in dover so i'm getting to know
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
and all of the little streets so the
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
most important message that i want to
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
convey this evening is that the
 
00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.509 align:start position:0%
convey this evening is that the
committee

00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
to echo others who have gone before me
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh must release the draft maps so that
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
the public can see them can give input
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
to them so that the process is
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
transparently uh demonstrating the kinds
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
of decisions that you're making and the
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
logic behind them
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
and why one alternative
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
map line would be chosen over another
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
i want to echo others who have lifted up
 
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.270 align:start position:0%
i want to echo others who have lifted up
the

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
bizarrely drawn executive council
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
district 2
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
of which dover is a part
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
a district that where democrats are
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
packed giving republicans a better
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
chance to win the other four districts
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
it seems clear that the design of this
 
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.030 align:start position:0%
it seems clear that the design of this
district

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
is intended to distort the
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
representation and to favor a political
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
agenda that is being revealed as
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
increasingly anti-democratic
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh another example to lift up is that
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
dover awards five and six both have
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
populations significant enough to merit
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
their own seat in the new hampshire
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
house of representatives
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
um as according to the numbers uh
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
defined in the new hampshire
 
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
defined in the new hampshire
constitution

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
but instead these wards share
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
three representatives with a somersworth
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
district 2
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
which is less coherent and is also
 
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.870 align:start position:0%
which is less coherent and is also
unfair

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
to the residents of somersworth ward 2
 
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.349 align:start position:0%
to the residents of somersworth ward 2
because

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
as a smaller share of the whole it is
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
harder for a summers worth person to be
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
elected in a district dominated by dover
 
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:43.829 align:start position:0%
elected in a district dominated by dover
voters

00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
i agree with the messages that that
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
everything is at stake with how we enact
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
these processes the integrity of our
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
democracy so i urge you to
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
to be conscientiously transparent and
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
accountable and to allow us to see the
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
draft maps with an opportunity for
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.630 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair my question to the witness
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
is that as i review the um size of each
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.230 align:start position:0%
of the
somersworth

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
somersworth
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
wards i see that not one of them is
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
large enough
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
to warrant its own
 
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.069 align:start position:0%
to warrant its own
representative

00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
they have to be combined in some way
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
um with someone else and i so
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
i see that as a problem that we have to
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
face just as i see the problem that we
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
have to face
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
that i do not believe that the city of
 
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.109 align:start position:0%
that i do not believe that the city of
dover

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
dover
 
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:19.510 align:start position:0%
dover
has

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
yet completed steps necessary
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
to equalize the population in wards
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
given that and
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
what would the
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
witness expect this committee to do to
 
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:36.940 align:start position:0%
be able to solve these problems
 
00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
be able to solve these problems

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith for you
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
for your question i i the intent of this
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
meeting is to hear from you and i i ask
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
for the question to be addressed to me
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
because i don't want anybody put on the
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
spot in regards to any sort of questions
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
or information requests um the
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
information regarding all of this is
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
available online and just to clarify
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
when we draw house district lines and
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm assuming is the district that
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in regards to your
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
own representative and i'm saying this
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
as an informational piece um we have to
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
stay within county lines
 
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
stay within county lines
um

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
town and city lines and ward lines
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
so when a city has wards and many of the
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
cities throughout the state will are
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
not on the same timeline that we are
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
um when the wards are there they need to
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
be combined with something so i want to
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for her testimony in
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
the city
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
but would just point out generally to
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
everybody who might be testifying on
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
cities that wards are a consideration
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
for this committee in regards to
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
district boundaries thank you may i
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
speak with just one sentence to what's
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
been raised as i depart my chair
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
just that i'm coming to understand this
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
process myself
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
and was not engaged in any detail uh ten
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
years ago but i am aware that through i
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
think it's the open democracy mapathon
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
project that there are ways of designing
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
maps that take into account the
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
complexities that you describe i just
 
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:13.829 align:start position:0%
complexities that you describe i just
to

00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
ask for as much transparency and
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
accountability in the in the next phases
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
of the process as possible thank you
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i think one item that the uh
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
chairs oh no
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is for everybody one item that the
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
chair brought up at the very beginning
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
tonight is the website uh if you go to
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
the website that uh
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
chair griffin described earlier you're
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
gonna find more information than you've
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
ever wanted to know on redistricting uh
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's worth a look and uh
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
you'll learn a lot by going there
 
00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.870 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
right

00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh hi my name is lana hunt hawkins thank
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
you all for being here and coming to our
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
county today and for uh working to
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully draw some fair maps uh i live
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
on old dover road in rochester i wear a
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
number of hats i'm currently a city
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
councilor i'm running for mayor of
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
rochester um
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
i have no major complaints about
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
currently how our house districts go we
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
have six wards there's nine seats three
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
floaters um
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
that work out to two wards each i think
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
that we're very fortunate that it's so
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
neat um and that we're not you know
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
sharing um representation with other
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
potentially unlike uh
 
00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:40.390 align:start position:0%
potentially unlike uh
towns

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to our senate district
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
in our executive council district though
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i think people are going to keep
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
bringing up executive council district 2
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
is something where the shape just
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense and i think that
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
the state acknowledges it and that the
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
travel stipend is higher for that
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
district than in any other one
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
similarly with our senate district um
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's rochester and then most of the
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
areas north of it i think that we're
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
kind of grouped in with mostly unlike uh
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
towns and remote towns there are no
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
cities north of us that are part of the
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
district um so i i think that should be
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
something that's considered in this next
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
round of redistricting definitely
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the executive council
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
district two um and i really hope that
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity more than the 24
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
hours that was allotted last time to
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
give feedback once there have been um
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
once lines have been drawn
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
um and that's it thank you all
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:53.910 align:start position:0%

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
which is covers
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
wards 1 3 4 and 5 in somersworth and the
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
i sit on the health and human services
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%

as well as somersworth school board

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
the big concerns that we have in the
 
00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
city of somersworth
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
that i've seen is that challenge our
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
elderly and new
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
people who are recently involved with
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
our legislative voting process
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
and trying to understand who
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
is running
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
and who is running
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
in their ward
 
00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:55.109 align:start position:0%
in their ward
it's

00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
very difficult when for instance this
 
00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.710 align:start position:0%
very difficult when for instance this
year

00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
all of the people that will be voting
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
for local office
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
are voting for people who all live in
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
the city of somersworth
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
but next year
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned previously the people
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
in ward 2 won't be voting for all of the
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
represent representatives that live in
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
the town of somersworth
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to vote
 
00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.589 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to vote
consider

00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
representatives from dover as well as
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
the city of somersworth
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
i've been approached by numerous elderly
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
members who have
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
been very frustrated when they've gone
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
to the polls and find out they can't
 
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.910 align:start position:0%
to the polls and find out they can't
vote

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
for the people they thought they were
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to vote that their friends were
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
talking about from other parts of the
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
city and they were all set to vote for
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
people and find out their names are not
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
on the ballot
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
i had one of the members of my church
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually she
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
had a fit
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
at the polling location and they had to
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
calm her down and said this is the way
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
as a rep i'm frustrated
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
because i'm representing the city of
 
00:44:06.319 --> 00:44:07.670 align:start position:0%
because i'm representing the city of
somersworth

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
somersworth
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
in a small town of rosford where things
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
are quite different
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
luckily we do have a rep who lives in
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
rawensford and work closely with her
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
but if all the reps that were
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
elected from
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
into district 18 were from somersworth
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
they would be left out without a
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for me also when a
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
resident from somersworth
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
who lives in ward 2
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
contacts me to ask them to represent
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
them in their issue in concord
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
i also have to refer them to the
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.430 align:start position:0%

lastly i'm asking you to please plan to
 
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.670 align:start position:0%
lastly i'm asking you to please plan to

hi
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
my name is david holt i am a lifelong
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire and a

homeowner of 20 years
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
in somersworth new hampshire i live at

7a ash street
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you all for coming here and
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
listening to us i have a few points to
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
make um
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
we need to ensure that everyone has a
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
say in this registry uh covet is still
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
an issue and even if we're not there's
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
always going to be people who are going
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
to find it difficult to attend meetings
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
such as this in person
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
we need to have virtual accessibility so
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
that everyone has a voice
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
we need a say not just before the maps
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
are drawn but before they're finalized
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
as it's been said before
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
we really need to have a public hearing
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
to allow everyone to be able to weigh in
 
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
to allow everyone to be able to weigh in
on

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.430 align:start position:0%
what the
tentative

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
tentative
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
decisions are on what the districts will
 
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.390 align:start position:0%
decisions are on what the districts will
be

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for this is that we
 
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.150 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for this is that we
have

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering that is
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh rampant across the country and across
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
we should all want to ensure that our
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
legislators are beholden to their
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
constituents the severe gerrymandering
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
taking place in new hampshire and the
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
u.s is destroying our democracy
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislators act on their own or their
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
donors interests because they know with
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
the system in place they are unlikely to
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
lose future elections
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
but there are many issues and not
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
everyone in either party agrees on all
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
even those who have gerrymandered to
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
ensure easy victories for the
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
legislators may find themselves subject
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
to legislative votes that affect them
 
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.109 align:start position:0%
to legislative votes that affect them
detrimentally

00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
detrimentally
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
one great example that's been brought up
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
many times tonight is the second
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
district

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
which stretches all the way from vermont
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
to maine
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
this is gerrymandered to the ninth
 
00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:12.390 align:start position:0%
this is gerrymandered to the ninth
degree

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
we have a right to fair representation
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
and this is not it
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh we have little in common with people
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
that live about two hours away
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
somersworth and every town and city
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
should have their own representatives uh
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
we have no one who is speaking just for
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
somersworth i have no problems with our
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
representatives i uh
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
highly recommend all of them but we need
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
to have representatives for somersworth
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
with the numbers as they're stated
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
3444 per district we could have three
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
possibly four representatives in
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
somersworth uh someone had made the
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
point before that um
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
a single ward doesn't uh have enough
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
people to to be its own district but
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
at the same time i also wanted to point
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
out that these words are going to be
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
redrawn uh within the next few years and
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
they are not being redrawn by the same
 
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.150 align:start position:0%
they are not being redrawn by the same
body

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
so they will
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
totally disrupt whatever decisions you
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
folks make so one of the ways to
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
minimize the damage of that is to uh to
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
try to keep the uh the ward districts
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
within the the town and give every town
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
or city its own representatives
 
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.650 align:start position:0%
or city its own representatives
um

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:26.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:28.150 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that our new hampshire
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
state constitution requires that the
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
state legislative districts be
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
contiguous and preserve political
 
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.230 align:start position:0%
contiguous and preserve political
subdivisions

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that was brought up
 
00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.630 align:start position:0%
and that was brought up
uh

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
but to
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
give the same weight to wards that are
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
going to be redrawn
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
by a separate entity is
 
00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
by a separate entity is
nonsensical

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
so basically i just want to emphasize
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to have a
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
fair democracy here and what we are
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
getting with the gerrymandering is not
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
that so again thank you very much for
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
showing up and i hope that you will take
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts into consideration and i'll
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
just leave some of my notes here
 
00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.109 align:start position:0%
just leave some of my notes here

00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr holt
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
good evening representatives thanks for
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
coming and give us an opportunity to
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
i really have kind of a progression of
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
points i wish to make
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it starts out with the notion that
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
many of the speakers before me have
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
spoken to and there's the issue of
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
fairness and transparency
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
this is gets painted about it gets
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
but there are a simple couple of tests
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i'll speak to those as i go through
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
but the simple test is can you explain
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
how you ended up with that final map
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
test can you explain it with a straight
 
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
test can you explain it with a straight
face

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
face
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
that's the test i would ask for you to
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
to internalize and to bring into that
 
00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.230 align:start position:0%
to internalize and to bring into that
process

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.430 align:start position:0%
process
so

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a history of
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering it's been shown by
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
several studies of the
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire political
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
reapportionment system
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
with this history of gerrymandering when
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
the executive council structure from
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
border to border no one can look at that
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
with straight face and say that's
 
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.790 align:start position:0%
with straight face and say that's
appropriate

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
and what does that do to our population
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
what does it do role of voters when we
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
have to go out there and ask them to
 
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.589 align:start position:0%
have to go out there and ask them to
vote

00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
so within my town we had difficulty
 
00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:55.030 align:start position:0%
so within my town we had difficulty
getting

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
our representatives to actually speak to
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
us about the last election the
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty with that is it really
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
undermines public trust
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
given our history of gerrymandering and
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
the redemption commission that was
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor not once but
 
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.710 align:start position:0%
vetoed by the governor not once but
twice

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
twice
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
um you know that will undermines when
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
you can't say that to uh the voter and
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
expect them to have a uh understanding
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
why an independent commission was not
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
the way to go with this it's so deeply
 
00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:24.470 align:start position:0%
the way to go with this it's so deeply
partisan

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
that combined with the gop chair
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
guaranteed his constituents
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
that they would win the seat in
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
manchester and he directly alluded to
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
gerrymander as the reason he was so
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
confident the gop would capture the the
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
house seat and the congressional house
 
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.670 align:start position:0%
house seat and the congressional house
seat

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
seat
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
what does that do to public confidence
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
in the last election in my town for a
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
select board not a huge statewide
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
position i'll give you that but only 13
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
percent of our population voted
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
so that tells me that people are just
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
like it doesn't matter what my vote is
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
you folks have an opportunity to take
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
the high road and make sure that this
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
thing is transparent and easily
 
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
thing is transparent and easily
communicated

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:11.130 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
the consequences you know i spoke to
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat in terms of disconnect from the
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
the voters and when i uh i speak to
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
the uh the population i was a candidate
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
this last election
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
that there is deep distrust but also
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
deep you know it's a lack of knowledge
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
about the process we have an opportunity
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
i should say you have the opportunity
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
now to make sure that this is well
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
communicated and brought into our town
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
so my final point
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
with that would simply be
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
that when you get done with this
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
you should make it a standing policy
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
that this has to be brought before
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh a forum in each individual town so a
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative comes before the town and
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
shows the map and this is what we did
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
and this is why we did it but that has
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
to be in person in front of
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh the voters
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
the reason for that being in person is
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
that that makes it real
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of having this well it's
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
on the website
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i spent a lot of time in the
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
computer these things are not as easily
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
obtained as you might think you live
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
inside that website you know where
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
you're going
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
and for many of our folks particularly
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
with the elderly and the harass to young
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
parents they're not going to go on their
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
website so if you don't come before the
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
voters person to person and make it real
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
it will not get
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
communicated so i strongly urge that you
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
hold yourself up as a rep in front of
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
your town
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
and and show some some courage in front
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the voters and explain why you did
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you stan for your testimony
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.799 --> 00:55:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
sharon

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
session you held in merrimack county
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
many there testified about the details
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the 2010 redistricting
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
and many exhorted you to operate in a
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
transparent manner
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%

i second those please there's no need
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
for me to repeat them here others have
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
already and will continue to do that i'm
 
00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.069 align:start position:0%
already and will continue to do that i'm
sure

00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
yours is a sacred trust
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
if we as a people are con
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
continue to believe in our democracy
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
we must have trust that our votes
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
our most fundamental right and
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility will count
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
when districts are created to manipulate
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
election results
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
we all lose
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
republicans in gerrymandered democratic
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
districts may as well not vote
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
the same for democrats and republican
 
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.829 align:start position:0%
the same for democrats and republican
districts

00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
when state legislatures become lopsided
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
in favor of one party or the other
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
unrepresentative of the state
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
because districts have been drawn to
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
ensure partisan victories
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
we as a people lose our trust
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
many give up on participation
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
and our democracy is seriously eroded
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so i urge you
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
both democrats and republicans
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
to set aside your party affiliation
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
hard as that may be in these political
 
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.349 align:start position:0%
hard as that may be in these political
times

00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
set new hampshire districts to make them
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
every possible one of them
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
as competitive as possible
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
yours is a sacred trust
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
i wish you every success in fulfilling
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
that trust
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
i will send this testimony to you
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
electronically as well
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
testify tonight
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
i am

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.789 align:start position:0%
the president of dover for the last 35
years

00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%

i'm a retired computer science professor

from unh
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm a member of the technical

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
attack
 
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.549 align:start position:0%
attack
um

00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
first i just want to mention people have
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned several towns already but in
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
fact five towns in stratford county
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
dover somersworth rollinsford durham and
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
barrington all past resolutions or
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
warrant articles asking for a fair and
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
transparent redistributing process
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll honor those resolutions
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
by running a process where at the end
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
every citizen of the state
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
will know why
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
their boundaries were drawn where they
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
were they may not like them
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
but the least understand why they were
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
the open boxy mapathon
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
project last night released
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
maps for congressional districts
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
executive council districts and the new
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
this was done on a zoom meeting so in a
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
forum citizens could comment on those
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
maps provide input to that process
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
my focus though on that project has been
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
on drawing house maps new hampshire
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
house maps as you get as you alluded
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
earlier tonight this is a very
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
challenging problem
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh we're
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
working hard on this we hope to have
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
house maps for the 10 counties released
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
as you alluded to there's there's very
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
severe challenges fulfilling
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
one person one vote
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
the requirement
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the constitution that town's a
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
sufficient population be given their own
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated rep
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
and requirement that districts be
 
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.829 align:start position:0%
and requirement that districts be
contiguous

00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
contiguous
 
00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:56.950 align:start position:0%
contiguous
um

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
this could you know even the definition
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
of contiguous is a challenge for us i
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
think is meeting in a point does that
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
define a border the constitution talks
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
about a border
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
there's a point of border
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer but it's an open
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
question and i'll come back to that in a
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
moment it has relevance in stratfor
 
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.390 align:start position:0%
moment it has relevance in stratfor
county

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think some people would like us to
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
think this is a mathematical jigsaw
 
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
think this is a mathematical jigsaw
puzzle

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
puzzle
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
in which there's only one possible way
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
to put the pieces together
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
so for instance summers worth two dover
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
five and over six in 2011.
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
it happened because gee that's the way
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
it broke down it's just the only way it
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
could have happened
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think people want to think that they
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
want the rest of us to think that
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
so what i did as part of the map of
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
project is i wrote software
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
to automatically generate
 
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.349 align:start position:0%
to automatically generate
potential

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house maps
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
that fulfill the constitutional
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and minimize
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
the number of towns awards
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
that are not given eligible towns awards
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
that are not given their own rep
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay this is an algorithmic
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
problem that is in my wheelhouse
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
what i want to tell you is there's lots
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
of options in all the counties in
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
particular in stratford county at the
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
there's literally tens or even hundreds
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
of different ways to configure the maps
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the constitutional
 
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.510 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the constitutional
requirements

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
and minimize the number of towns that
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
are not given
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
eligible towns have not given their own
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
in general to satisfy all of them that's
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
what what discussion earlier was
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
alluding to
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
but i believe we should minimize that
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i think the citizens of the state
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
expect that from us
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
and just saying it's too hard to do that
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
so stratfor county 2020 let me just back
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
up a 2010 there's actually four towns
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
or wards in stratford county that did
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
not get a dedicated rep that should have
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
those are milton stratford dover five
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
and dover six
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
so let's look at the stratfor county
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
2020 situation
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
you know as as you said we do not know
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
the war boundaries
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
so i again i think the public would like
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
to know what are you guys going to do
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
about that in your internal process
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
how are you going to deal with that what
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
i did in my situation i didn't know what
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
else to do so i took i assume the
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
average population reached those wards
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
figuring that when the towns draw the
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
wards they're going to have to do
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
something approximating that in order to
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
get the secretary of state to approve it
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
so my algorithm uses that as the input
 
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.109 align:start position:0%
so my algorithm uses that as the input
um

01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
other challenges in stafford county is
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
that there's three cities with wards
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
that are actually border each other
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
they're sort of packed together in a
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
corner of the county
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
but my software tells me we can do a map
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
for 2020
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
with only two violations
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
if we exploit
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
as is exploited in the 2010 map
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
connecting new durham and stratford at a
 
01:03:20.319 --> 01:03:22.309 align:start position:0%
connecting new durham and stratford at a
point

01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't like that
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
so what do we do you know if the
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
constitution says
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
that every eligible town should be given
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
its own rep
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
and we can do it with two if we use that
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
point is that point stand up to legal
 
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.190 align:start position:0%
point is that point stand up to legal
challenge

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
is that a border
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
the alternative according to my software
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
is you can do it with three violations
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
don't allow
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
also i want to
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
mention david andrews alternative
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
component method which i believe
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
again he's part he's actually the leader
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the technical mapping crew at the
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
open democracy mapathon project i
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
believe he presented this to you at the
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
merrimack listening session
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
my software also uses that approach as
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
well as the conventional component
 
01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.789 align:start position:0%
well as the conventional component
method

01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
method
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i believe using that method
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
we can build a map for stratfor county
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
with only one violation
 
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.510 align:start position:0%
with only one violation

[Music]
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
again i hope you'll take a close look at
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
that and have legal authorities take a
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
look at that to me it's a small tweak
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
to the component method that was
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
discussed in the supreme court decision
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer however
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
but let me tell you with that approach
 
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
it will help in strafford county
 
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.430 align:start position:0%
it will help in strafford county
[Music]

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
but now we get to the real meat which is
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do i'm claiming
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll be happy to share my maps with
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
people who are interested i'm claiming
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's tens if not hundreds of possible
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
ways to map stratfor county
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
which one are you going to choose
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay earlier tonight it sounded like you
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
were saying
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
we can't do anything that's the best we
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
can do that's not going to be good
 
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.589 align:start position:0%
can do that's not going to be good
enough

01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:08.470 align:start position:0%
enough
okay

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
there are trade-offs however
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
as i said we can get it down to two
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
if we allow districts to meet at a point
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people don't like that
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
also some of my maps are going to have
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
large filterials which
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
also happened in 2011 and large can be
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
measured in various different ways uh
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
population for instance
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
number of precincts you know wards and
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
towns that are combined together or even
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
number of floaterial seats that you end
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
up with
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
do we not like that
 
01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
do we not like that
um

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
do we want to keep city wards together
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
for this discussion of summers or it's
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
just some other be kept with somersworth
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
as best as we can should dover be kept
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
with dover should rochester be kept with
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
and then there's the whole community of
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
interest idea
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have lots of choices folks we have
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
tens hundreds of maps to choose from
 
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.630 align:start position:0%
tens hundreds of maps to choose from
okay

01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
are we going to use community of
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
interest data such as school district
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
boundaries to sort through those
 
01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.589 align:start position:0%
boundaries to sort through those
alternatives

01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:13.029 align:start position:0%
alternatives
um

01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
so my question is what are what are your
 
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.510 align:start position:0%
so my question is what are what are your
criteria

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know someone raised this at your
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
working session
 
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.069 align:start position:0%
working session
um

01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
and it was claimed it's just a
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
mathematical problem that's all it is
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
well i'm here to tell you it's not just
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
a mathematical problem there's lots of
 
01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
a mathematical problem there's lots of
solutions

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to choose one from
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
those solutions
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
how are you going to make that choice i
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
think the public should know
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
what your criteria are
 
01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:40.990 align:start position:0%
what your criteria are
okay

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.829 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
also at your working session in concord
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
joel anderson presented his tool
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
that the committee has at their
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
at their disposal to work on this
 
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.190 align:start position:0%
at their disposal to work on this
problem

01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
it shocked me at that meeting that joel
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually said that
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
he had a database of solutions
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm not the only one saying there's
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
he said part of that tool is a database
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
of solutions
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
i think the public should see those
 
01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:16.230 align:start position:0%
i think the public should see those
solutions

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
i know you say there's licensing
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
problems with this software i think the
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
public should understand i would like to
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
have a public statement exactly what are
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
those licensing problems but no matter
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
what the licensing process is on a
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
software the database of solutions
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
should be released to the public
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
for instance it helped people like me
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
understand how good his tool is is he
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
present providing you with a complete
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
set of possible solutions or not
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
moreover he has four counties he said he
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
hadn't been able to get to work
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
i've got solutions for stratfor county
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
he didn't have it maybe he's fixed his
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
know what what does his tool do about
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
ward boundaries
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
how are you using that tool he has to
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
have made some assumption about war
 
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.430 align:start position:0%
have made some assumption about war
bodies

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think it'd be good for the public to
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
know what that is as well if you are
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
truly using his tool
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
so let me just close there my point is
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of solutions
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
for mapping counties for new hampshire
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
house maps
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
you need criteria to sort through the
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
possibilities you should discuss that in
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
a public session so we can see what
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
you're thinking is and you should
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
publicize what those criteria are
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
again i'd be happy to share anything
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
that i have there's no licensing
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
agreements on my software i'm happy to
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
share whatever you want to see with it
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the only data it takes as input is the
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
same as joel's it takes populations and
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
it takes the
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know which districts are adjacent to
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you phil
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you senators and representatives

01:09:15.839 --> 01:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
barrington
um

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
only three years in barrington
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
transplant from south of the border
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
like many might be
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
since i can't tell you a lot of stories
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
about stratford county i'll share a
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
cautionary tale from the south of the
 
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.829 align:start position:0%
cautionary tale from the south of the
border

01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
border
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be about
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
elbridge gary you all know where that
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
term came from and what he did in the
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
18th century
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
this is about carol cleven
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
a representative of a town of chemsword
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
mass just south of the border
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
37 000 people we had our own rap
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
intersection of two
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
federal highways
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
well-off good school system all the
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
things that communities aspire for
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
and for the longest time they had their
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative on beacon hill
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
in the last round of redistricting
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
which was a closed and very political
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
process there that
 
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.270 align:start position:0%
process there that
probably

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
only could have happened there in
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but uh
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
they decided to break up the wards
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of chemsford where i
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
lived had to go to four different places
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we had four different reps all from
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
other towns
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
nobody from those districts could run
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
because you were only a small portion
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
towns one quarter of our size had
 
01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
towns one quarter of our size had
representatives

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
and a precinct from our town
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
it upset a lot of citizens in our town
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't the only location where it
 
01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.030 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't the only location where it
happened

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
um despite what's on my shirt
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh i voted for carol she was rep a good
 
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.709 align:start position:0%
uh i voted for carol she was rep a good
rep

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
rep
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
attentive listened to her community
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
she was a republican in massachusetts a
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
rare bird
 
01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:00.390 align:start position:0%
rare bird
um

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
and of course she lost her seat
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens decided to look into
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
the process they got it opened up with
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of information laws and stuff
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
found under the rock
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
some very ugly things that happened
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not accusing this on this committee
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
but concerned citizens who really didn't
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
understand this process
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
opened it
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
up and it did not go well for some of
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
the people involved
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
i would recommend a website
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
google and you could look at the end of
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
the career
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
of thomas finneran in massachusetts
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
a very powerful man on beacon hill
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
it got ugly for him
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
and he lost his position
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
over the political decisions made in
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
redistricting in 2010.
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen here
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
if you measure up to the ideals that
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
you've set forth in the process
 
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
and do what the citizens behind me ask
 
01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.430 align:start position:0%
and do what the citizens behind me ask
for

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be a problem
 
01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be a problem
but

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
if 60 or more than 60 cases were brought
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
after november with no evidence
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
i hate to think what would happen
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
if the citizens decided that this wasn't
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
done fairly
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
i wish you success
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
and hope you can honor the ideals of
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
this process that you have before you
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%

add a couple of views with regard to the

citiz the citizens of dober and
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
somersworth you've already heard some of
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
this and the acoustics being what they
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
are i'm not sure that i heard any of it
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
accurately but
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
some of the people seem to make
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of sense
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
that i could hear
 
01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:41.830 align:start position:0%
that i could hear
but

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
the situation in dover and somersworth
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
is one that i hope will not be
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
maintained or repeated and i joined the
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
suit uh 10 years ago
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
to try to change that because
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
what was done was not proper
 
01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.410 align:start position:0%
what was done was not proper
um

01:13:58.410 --> 01:13:58.420 align:start position:0%

i talked with the secretary of state
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago and showed him the
 
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.669 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago and showed him the

01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
that the water realignment in dover had
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
produced uh as you know the the supreme
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
court has not said that every entity has
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
to be exactly equal to every other one
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of population you just have to
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
get as close as is workable and
 
01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:21.830 align:start position:0%
get as close as is workable and

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the the secretary of state mr
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
gardner said at that time that the
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
result that the ward realignment process
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
in dover had produced was perfect to use
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
his words because a dover has a
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
population that breaks down in its six
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
wards to about
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
5 000
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
per ward
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what they had
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
each ward had just a few more if you're
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
less than five thousand
 
01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:51.270 align:start position:0%
less than five thousand
um

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.229 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
therefore under the constitution
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
every one of those awards was entitled
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
to a representative of its own
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
and taken two wards together
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
to have a floatario
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
i represent wards one and two
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
and have for the past 19 years wards one
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
and two
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
five thousand per ward
 
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.270 align:start position:0%
five thousand per ward
roughly

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.310 align:start position:0%
roughly
uh

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
taken together is ten thousand so under
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution that would be
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
approximate that would be three reps for
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
awards one and two and that's what
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's what wards one and two got
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
and wards three and four are very very
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
similar numbers
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
um and they're entitled also to three
 
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
um and they're entitled also to three
reps

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
reps
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's what they got
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
words five and six you've heard referred
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
to already several times
 
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.750 align:start position:0%
to already several times
um

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
five and six had essentially the same
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
population as all the other awards in
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
dover um and therefore they were
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
entitled to three reps
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
but specifically ward five was entitled
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
to one rep of its own
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
and one floatarial rep right word six
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
was entitled to one rep of its own and
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
one floatarial
 
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
one floatarial
rep

01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
rep
 
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
rep
um

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
and that's not what five and six got
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
they got
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
put together with summers worth two
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
the three reps that wound up getting
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
elected from that district i believe
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's trafford 17.
 
01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.149 align:start position:0%
it's trafford 17.
[Music]

01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
[Music]
they

01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
they got elected
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
at large
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's not what the constitution calls
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
for that's one of the reasons i joined
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
the suit that's not what the
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
constitution calls for it calls for one
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
from five
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
one from six and one from five and six
 
01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.990 align:start position:0%
one from six and one from five and six
together

01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
but instead
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
they got this
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
lumping together with summer's worth two
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
now if you look at
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh summers were two and five and wards
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
five and six in dover together
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
from eagle eye view they six and and
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
ward two uh
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
lie next to each other but they don't
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
have any uh any real contact because
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's will and pond and and
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
the forest and so forth and so on it's
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
not like some of the ward lines in dover
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
where ward x is on one side of the
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
street and the ward y
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
starts right on the other side of the
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
street they have a their that's a
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood they have a real connection
 
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.149 align:start position:0%
neighborhood they have a real connection
but

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
i protested against that situation
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
because in addition
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
inequity that's that i've already spoken
 
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
inequity that's that i've already spoken
to

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
you have a situation where given
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
the the workings of the election you
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
might have all three representatives be
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
from dover
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
or all three of them could be from ward
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
two and somersworth
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
and in the first time and i think the
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
second term under that regime
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
you had all three representatives from
 
01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
you had all three representatives from
dover

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
dover
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
therefore summer's worth two
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
representatives had no representation
 
01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.550 align:start position:0%
representatives had no representation
whatsoever

01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
technically uh entitled to
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's unfair that's wrong
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see that happen again
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you folks have some authority to put
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
something together that
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
that ends that situation that's unfair
 
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
that ends that situation that's unfair
and

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
now in the last couple of years uh we've
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
had one of the representatives from
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
from district 17 b from ward 2 and
 
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.910 align:start position:0%
from district 17 b from ward 2 and
somersworth

01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
somersworth
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
but he's his loyalties if you will are
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
kind of divided too because he doesn't
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
just represent
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
ward two and somersworth he represents
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
five and six in dover as well what does
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
he know about five and six in dover it
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't live there there's no natural
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know interaction of the
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
populations and so forth
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
now the the ward realignment in in dover
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
as it was done 10 years ago was very
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
conscientious i wasn't on that ward
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
realignment board so i'm not patting
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
myself one to the back to say it was
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
done extremely conscientiously and
 
01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
done extremely conscientiously and
competently

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
competently
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and that's the the and the result was
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
so close to 5 000 in each one of the
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
awards that as i say
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
secretary of state gardner on looking at
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
it he said oh that's perfect
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
of course perfection is not required it
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
was a characterization not a
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
mathematical assessment
 
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.950 align:start position:0%
mathematical assessment
but

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
it didn't work out for wards five and
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
six and some is worth two
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be done again
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
of course i also have some objections to
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
the to the
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
districting that was done with regard to
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
the executive council that was clearly a
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering never should it be done
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
that way and it shouldn't be permitted
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
district that the dover is in
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
and it's connected by one
 
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
and it's connected by one
town

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:48.350 align:start position:0%
in the middle
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.750 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
you can do better than that and i hope
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
you will
so

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh i i think there was a question with
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
regard to the dover situation
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
from representative smith earlier on and
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
if she has not been enlightened by what
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
i've had to say would be happy to try to
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
answer a question or from representative
 
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
answer a question or from representative
turcotte

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
but otherwise thank you very much for
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
your attention i certainly hope the
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
microphone works well enough in terms of
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
the recording so that i can listen to
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
everybody else's remarks and figure out
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you just for information when i'm
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
on my phone i'm trying to text to see
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
how things are going i am informed the
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
live stream is coming through loud and
 
01:20:34.719 --> 01:20:35.669 align:start position:0%
live stream is coming through loud and
clear

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so i expect that anything that goes
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
online you'll be able to hear quite well
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
right and we're trying to stay on top of
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
that right and and one other thing for
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
the edification of all of you i sit in
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
front of one of these microphones in the
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
gel car as does uh senator gray on a
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
and you have to get right up so that
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're taking the bite out
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
of it because when you were speaking
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
before madam chair and you were up here
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the mic was down here
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
i could hear you talking i just couldn't
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
understand whether it was english or
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
when you speak up like that we can all
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt uh rep
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
then we will move on to representative
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
so i am representative timothy horrigan
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
from stratfor county district six which
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
is the towns of
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
durham and madbury or as i like to call
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
it greater madbury um we're
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
one of the uh we're one of the districts
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
that claim closest that came we were
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
like almost exactly the exact um
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
population for for five reps and
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually it looks like um judging by the
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
numbers i got from the census bureau
 
01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.709 align:start position:0%
numbers i got from the census bureau
website

01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
will be pretty close to a fraction
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
percentage point for next time although
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
my first two terms we were put in with
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
lee that was because we have a community
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
of interest um were part of the same
 
01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.149 align:start position:0%
of interest um were part of the same
uh

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
the three towns of durham lee and
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
madbury are part of the same same
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
district and you absolutely are allowed
 
01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.310 align:start position:0%
district and you absolutely are allowed
to

01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
take communities of interest such as
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
school districts into account it's not
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
just about the numbers which um
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
brings me to uh
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
basically my uh
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
my first point is um there's gonna be a
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
lot we're gonna you're gonna make a
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
decision about what a reasonable
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
deviation from the uh
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
from the ideal number is because the
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
audio number is
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
3448 and the towns and the city wards in
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
have numbers all over the place they
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're not all exact multiples of
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
3448 so that makes your life a little
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
tougher um
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
the constitution there's a
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment which was
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
passed in 2006 it's never really been
 
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.189 align:start position:0%
passed in 2006 it's never really been
obeyed

01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
obeyed
 
01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
obeyed
which

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
says in addition to districts having to
 
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:18.830 align:start position:0%
says in addition to districts having to
be

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
contiguous um
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
each each town each city ward is
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
entitled to its own own member
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
um within and says something about a
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable with an um if reasonably
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
practicable so it is reasonably
 
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.629 align:start position:0%
practicable so it is reasonably
practicable

01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
practicable
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
but we will probably have to use a
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
larger deviation than the plus or minus
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
five percent you know that's uh
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
been representative committee i heard
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
that when i viewed the youtube of the
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
district of the uh
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the original organizational center
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily true we can have
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
a higher deviation just means we have to
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
finish the plan
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
quicker if we have to send it to federal
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
court it'll have to go to federal court
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
um even the even the state house the
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
state senate districts are within the
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
purview of the federal government
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
and but they probably
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
would approve a plan with a higher
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
deviation especially since uh we our
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
state constitution pretty clearly states
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
that if a town that we should maximize
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
the number of towns that have their own
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
rep it's not just a question of
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
maximizing the number of districts as
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
was said 10 years ago by the then
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
majority leader it's uh you need to
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
maximize the number of towns that have
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
their own have their own rep and
 
01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
their own have their own rep and
[Music]

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
i didn't bring them with me i won't bore
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
you with it i did actually make up a
 
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.590 align:start position:0%
you with it i did actually make up a
plan

01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't have a mapping program i just
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
did it on a spreadsheet that uh
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
did a pretty good job of of uh obeying
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
that but
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
there was uh
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
when you get to the northern corner of
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state uh its
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
another corner of the county i mean it
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
is pretty hard to keep it within plus or
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
minus five percent um so the district i
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
came up with was the three town new
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
durham middleton and uh milton and i
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
think it was 13 off everybody else was
 
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.790 align:start position:0%
think it was 13 off everybody else was
like

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
within zero and six percent off um i
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
won't i've said too much about that but
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
you absolutely can use a bigger
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
definition vermont has about the same
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
ratio of uh
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
residents to state reps and they
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
the plan they used for the last 10 years
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
it varied from uh some districts or 10
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
percent off their ideals others were up
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
to 10 so it's like a plus or minus 10
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
percent or a 20 and their plan passed
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional muster so they get the
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
feds did not overturn their plans so we
 
01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
feds did not overturn their plans so we
can

01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they have more flexibility because
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
you can divide um municipalities in two
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
and you can find them into two pieces in
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
vermont whereas we have to you know
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
we can't draw
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
um we can't draw lines across uh
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
municipal uh city town or ward
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
boundaries and i also think it'd be good
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
idea even though it's not required in
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
not to draw too many districts across
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
city lines trying to just certainly what
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
was revenant schmidt
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned where they
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
stuck dover and part of dover and part
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
of summersworth did make the numbers
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
work better but i think that was not a
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
good idea i don't i mean the members who
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
were elected of all
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
serve both cities and the town of
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
rollins for uh with distinction but it
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
would have been better
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
not to have a district that was
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
partially dover and partially summer's
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
worth that's just uh in my mind
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
made no sense
 
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.229 align:start position:0%
made no sense
and

01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
another issue
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
contiguity we mentioned the so-called
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
merski bow tie district which was paul
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
merski the representative griffin's
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
predecessor 10 years ago is famous for
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
his collection of bow ties um
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
where those two towns met
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
at a point deep in the woods you had to
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
drive about 20 miles to get from one
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
town to the other
 
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.470 align:start position:0%
town to the other
i

01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
understood i understood just fiddling
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
around even with my printed map and
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet i now understood why he did
 
01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.470 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet i now understood why he did
it

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of the numbers but that's
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do that to get an
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable plan um you can put stratford
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
in with another community i actually
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
i did you could even put it in for
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
example with uh with rochester because
 
01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.790 align:start position:0%
example with uh with rochester because
um

01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you don't there are other things you
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
can do with stratford other than
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
sticking it with new durham there's a
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
couple there's like at least one other
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
blatantly non-contiguous district in the
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
state in belknap county whose meeting
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened yet but there's a
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
district that's guilford and
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
meredith where they meet out in the
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
middle of meredith bay
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
you have to drive about through three
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
miles of laconia to get from uh guilford
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
to meredith um
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
i remember like the chair at the time
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
said well it's just a short drive across
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
the weirs which is true but that was not
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
a contiguous district it's not been
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
drawn that way when
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
and actually even representative perkins
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
focus sentence district is only
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
contiguous in the loosest sense of the
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
lord since uh portsmouth is separated
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
from the rest of her district by uh by
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
little bay i mean there is a
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
bridge which has been renovated in the
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
past 10 years so there is like a very i
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
mean it's not hard to get not hard to
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
drive or even walk or bicycle from
 
01:27:49.199 --> 01:27:50.229 align:start position:0%
drive or even walk or bicycle from
uh

01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
from from dover to portsmouth or from
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
durham to portsmouth but her district is
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
technically it's
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
contiguous in a fairly loose sense of
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
the words so um
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
my other talking point the software we
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
haven't heard much about the software
 
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.390 align:start position:0%
haven't heard much about the software
apparently

01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
um some sort of software either
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
will be acquired by the committee or is
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
being acquired
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
what i heard
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
just listening on youtube at one of the
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
previous meetings i got what seemed like
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
a very very vague answer when they went
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
on about how difficult it was now
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's licensing issues i interpreted
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
that to me no you're not planning to
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
distribute it but that's
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
a decision that could be changed there
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
are in fact
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
eventually open democracy mapathon
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're using there are they're using
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
just one of many you know open source
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
public domain
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
mapping softwares that are out there so
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
you could easily
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
put together an open source
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
um software package to uh
 
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.870 align:start position:0%
um software package to uh
that

01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know respects the ward and city and
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
town lines and allows for floatarials
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
um it's actually the actual drawing the
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
plan it's a very politically it's a very
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
complicated issue it's a good thing
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're having all these hearings but
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually the actual nuts and bolts of
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
drawing the plan probably are not as
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
hard as you think um
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
eight years ago
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
eight years ago i actually drew up my
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
own plan because the software contractor
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
for that time was eventually released to
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
the public so i still had it two years
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
after the fact and i definitely only
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
like a couple of days of work um to
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
put together a
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
put together a plan which was you know
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
probably not as
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
i mean it was just obviously i thought
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
it was fine not that everybody would
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
think about it actually actually once
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
you actually
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
sit down and decide how to draw the plan
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's not actually going to take you that
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
long to do it it's not quite as
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
complicated as
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to represent it as
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
being but that's fine and
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
finally my last point and i've made too
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
many i've made a lot of points already
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
is please please please get the plan out
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
in time first of all get it out in time
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
if you take my advice and go with the
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
larger deviation please put on enough
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
time for the fed for the state and
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
federal courts to actually uh review the
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
plan because they're undoubtedly no
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
matter what you do there will be
 
01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.550 align:start position:0%
matter what you do there will be
lawsuits

01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
and um so put in town also put enough
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
time so people who are thinking running
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
office know where their district is
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
going to be like last year
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i was i was in durham and mad
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
very so i wasn't the only thing i had to
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
worry about was whether or not uh lee
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
was in my district but there's a number
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
of there's lots of people there who are
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
thinking and running even for house
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
seats who don't know where the district
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be especially if you
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
thinking running for the executive
 
01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.149 align:start position:0%
thinking running for the executive
council

01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
or the uh or even uh for you know the
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
state senate u.s congress you it's
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
lots of people inches those offices and
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're totally at a loss to figure out
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
like where exactly we're going to draw
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the lines so if you draw the lines a
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
little bit sooner than we did 10 years
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
ago that would i think be a really nice
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
thing for you to do for everyone
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
involved and
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
so good luck good luck with it it's a i
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
know this is a very complicated job and
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
no one's going to be pleased with the
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
result no matter what although it wasn't
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
that terrible last time in fact
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
and chair was actually the house side is
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
very fair-minded he carefully drew
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
himself a district
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
and he was a conservative republican
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
that was immediately immediately lost in
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
20 in 2012 to a liberal democrat on foot
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
so um thanks a lot for your time and uh
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
good luck with this whole process
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's james fisher
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
funny spelling but it's still fisher
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not running for office i'm not a
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not planning on being
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
a representative running for office i'm
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
just a normal citizen
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm also a retired physician
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
and uh i happen to live in dover ward
 
01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.110 align:start position:0%
and uh i happen to live in dover ward
five

01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh and the i pay both dover taxes and in
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
the back my property i pay madbury taxes
 
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.110 align:start position:0%
the back my property i pay madbury taxes
because

01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
that part is in madbury
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
um and so to discover that i share
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
a congr a district with somersworth on
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
the other side of dover is kind of a
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
shock to me
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm really not sure how
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
one representative
 
01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:14.629 align:start position:0%
one representative
could

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:32:14.639 --> 01:32:15.590 align:start position:0%
could
fairly

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.709 align:start position:0%
fairly
represent

01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
somersworth and
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
my part of dover at the same time it
 
01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.750 align:start position:0%
my part of dover at the same time it
seems

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
well it's kind of like
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like buying fish
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know does it pass the smell test
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
and this just doesn't pass the smell
 
01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
and this just doesn't pass the smell
test

01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.709 align:start position:0%
test
so

01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
so
it

01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that's my concern tonight
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that's probably the message i want
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
to to bring out to you
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
is that whatever you do and and listen
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'm no expert in redistricting i'm no
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
expert in
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
in politics
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
i really don't care about that i think
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
most patients or most patients yeah most
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
people don't don't care about you i've
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
been practicing for a long time
 
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.030 align:start position:0%
been practicing for a long time
uh

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
most people don't care about that either
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
they they're kind of like me they want
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
to see if it if it passes the smell test
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
and so i have
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
three asks of this committee
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to tell you how to do your
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
job although
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't want to pass this off
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
to some independent group so they take
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
the heat i don't know but that's that's
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's up to you not me
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
um my first ask is that
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day when you finish
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
the the process
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
does do the districts that you've drawn
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
does that accurately reflect
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
the geography the politics of the state
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
if the state is evenly divided into
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
democrats and republicans and
 
01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:47.189 align:start position:0%
democrats and republicans and
independents

01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
independents
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
do the maps reflect that or do they
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
reflect a bias towards one group or the
 
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
reflect a bias towards one group or the
other

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.390 align:start position:0%
other
and

01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's important because of my second
 
01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.430 align:start position:0%
that's important because of my second
ask

01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
certainly this year we've seen an
 
01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.750 align:start position:0%
certainly this year we've seen an
insurrection

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
insurrection
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
at the capitol
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to overthrow an election
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.350 align:start position:0%
we've seen
our

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
national congress unable to come up with
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
decisions to to get the country out of
 
01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:19.430 align:start position:0%
decisions to to get the country out of
debt

01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
to to move forward in some of the
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
projects that we need to move forward on
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
to become competitive in the world
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
and worse we've seen neighbors
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
fighting against each other
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
because our representatives
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
have secure seats
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
they have a sure thing
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have to answer to all their
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
constituents they only have to answer to
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
the constituents that
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
they want to answer to that they've
 
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.189 align:start position:0%
they want to answer to that they've
selected

01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
selected
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
when they've decided who their what
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
their district is going to look like
 
01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:52.870 align:start position:0%
their district is going to look like
and

01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
therefore the idea of compromise the
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
idea of working out solutions is no
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
longer something that we're interested
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
in this country we're only interested in
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
satisfying our own constituents
 
01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.870 align:start position:0%
satisfying our own constituents
so

01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons i moved to new
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire well over 35 years ago is
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
because this is a state that values
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
representation this is a state where
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
neighbors actually take care of each
 
01:35:17.679 --> 01:35:18.629 align:start position:0%
neighbors actually take care of each
other

01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:35:18.639 --> 01:35:19.590 align:start position:0%
other
i

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
i have respect for each and every one of
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
you i think you're all here not i mean
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
some of you i mean you have to mind your
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
own party i understand all of that okay
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
i can i can deal with that
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:31.510 align:start position:0%
i can i can deal with that
but

01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
you also really care about this state
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
and you really care about your neighbors
 
01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
and you really care about your neighbors
and

01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
the only way that i can see as a
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
physician as as a as a citizen of the
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
state that we can come together
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
as a nation but certainly come together
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
is if we have
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
districts where people actually have to
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
talk to each other have to work things
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
out so that
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
one group doesn't dominate over all the
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
rest we may not agree on anything but
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
we've got to be able to agree to
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
disagree and we're not even able to do
 
01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.109 align:start position:0%
disagree and we're not even able to do
that

01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
and and gerrymandering isn't the whole
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
problem but it's part of the problem and
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that you actually have a
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
chance to fix
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
that you can actually do something about
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
you can send a message to
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
every citizen in this state at the end
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
of the day when you've drawn up your
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
maps when you've done what you think is
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
and and it has to pass the smell test
 
01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.149 align:start position:0%
and and it has to pass the smell test
and

01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
and you can say to every member of this
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
state we care about you your voice is
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
important to us but we also want you to
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
talk to each other to talk to your
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
neighbors and value your neighbors
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
because that's what new hampshire is
 
01:36:48.159 --> 01:36:49.510 align:start position:0%
because that's what new hampshire is
about

01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.030 align:start position:0%
about
and

01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
and to draw district lines to
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
separate people to divide the nation is
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
only going to make the problem worse
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
so my second ask is
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
please well i guess it's the first task
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
too and how they think about it you know
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
pass the smell test at the end of the
 
01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
pass the smell test at the end of the
day

01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
my last ask is that you give us time to
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
review what you've done at the end of
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
the day not just 24 hours but let us
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
look at it i mean
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
the people that have come before me have
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
already said you know they want they
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
want the ability to say you know to be
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
able to be looked in the eye and said
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is why we drew it the way we did
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
and we tried to be as fair as we could
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
i trust you uh i have to trust you
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
you're our representatives but i also
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for all the work that
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
you've done some of you've come a long
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
distance to be here and i appreciate
 
01:37:41.199 --> 01:37:42.149 align:start position:0%
distance to be here and i appreciate
that

01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:42.950 align:start position:0%
that
and

01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
i wish you luck and i thank you for the
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
good evening
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm representing peter
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
bixby representing stratfor district 17
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
which uh represents two wards in dover
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
and one ward in somersworth
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
and um i'd just like to uh
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
make a quick reference to our part two
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
article 11 of the constitution
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh when a population of any town or ward
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
according to the last federal census is
 
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:28.790 align:start position:0%
according to the last federal census is
in

01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
is within a reasonable deviation from
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
the ideal population for one or more
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative seats
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the town or ward shall have its own
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
district of one or more representative
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
seats and skipping out
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
down a little bit
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
informing districts the boundaries of
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
towns wards and unincorporated places
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
shall be preserved and contiguous
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
i like summersworth
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's fair that i am
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
representing people as a
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
as a resident of dover
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
i am representing
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
the people of ward 2 and somersworth i
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
think that they should have
 
01:39:05.199 --> 01:39:05.910 align:start position:0%
think that they should have
a

01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated they should
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh have a dedicated representative that
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
covers their ward and probably one other
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
award in order to balance it out in
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
summer's worth uh as opposed to being
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
tacked on to dover uh
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
it so happens that there is one
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative from ward 2 and in
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
summer's worth at this point but
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
typically anybody who is running from
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
somersworth is going to be a
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
disadvantage against anyone who is
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
running against the two wards in in
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
dover uh so uh it is set up to uh
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
essentially uh not represent that ward
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
in summer's worth and i i don't think
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate
 
01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.590 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate
um

01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:52.390 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh and this is
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
this is one instance of this that
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
happened in the last redistricting there
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
were a number of others
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh i think hudson and pelham probably
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
have even more to complain about than
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
than summer's worth in this case because
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh hud pelham is smaller than hudson and
 
01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:12.790 align:start position:0%
uh hud pelham is smaller than hudson and
has

01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:13.990 align:start position:0%
has
basically

01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
gets hubs hudson representatives because
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:40:18.719 --> 01:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
i i really would urge you to pay close
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
attention to that idea of making sure
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
that any
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh ward or town or district that is
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
large enough for its own representative
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
gets one
 
01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:38.950 align:start position:0%
gets one
and

01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.830 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
uh
pay

01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
also pay attention to
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
the uh requirement that
 
01:40:45.679 --> 01:40:46.950 align:start position:0%
the uh requirement that
uh

01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
boundaries of towns and rewards be
 
01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.109 align:start position:0%
boundaries of towns and rewards be
respected

01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
respected
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
and i recognize that that you with the
 
01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
way numbers work out it's not going to
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
be perfect and that's why we have
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
floatarial districts which can help do
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
that further balancing
 
01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
that further balancing
um

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:05.910 align:start position:0%
and so uh
that

01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's the main thing i'm here for i
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
would also like to urge as a number of
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
people have also done before that uh
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
when there is a draft
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
that map be published soon enough so
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
that there's a chance for public
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
hearings and public comment and that
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
public those public hearings should also
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
be made accessible to remote access
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
with that i'll close and uh i wish you
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
good luck uh with this fairly
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
complicated process thank you
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bixby for those
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the audience and around the table we
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
are on a pace to finish right around
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
eight we have five more individuals who
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
are what's that
 
01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.229 align:start position:0%
are what's that
oh

01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
all right well i have five more on my
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
sheet and a couple more after that i
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives thank you
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
senators my name is emmett stoldatti i
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
hail from somersworth
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
which is the smallest the tiniest city
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire it is so
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
small that it probably should be a town
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
and it actually was a town for much of
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
its history
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
except back in the 1800s the great falls
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing company a textile mill
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
company that built the mills decided
 
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
that the townsfolk were not doing enough
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
to serve the corporate interests of the
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
great falls manufacturing company and
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
the ceo of the great falls manufacturing
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
company came up with a brilliant idea in
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
1890 and that was to turn somersworth
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
then great falls into a city
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
and by turning it into a city they could
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
split it into five wards
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
and fortunately for them uh many of the
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
folks in the wards did not speak english
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
most of them spoke uh french because
 
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.189 align:start position:0%
they were
french-canadian

01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
french-canadian
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
and they were able to identify enough
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
people in these five wards that were
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the corporate interests
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the great falls manufacturing company
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
and they were successful in 1893
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
somersworth then great falls became a
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
city and they elected five
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
representatives against the four
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
at-large representatives that were very
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the corporate interests
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
of somersworth
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
which is the nature of my remarks today
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
is that i think as much as the folks
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
before me have spoken about uh making
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure that our electorate
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
and the the citizenry that elects them
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
feels confident uh in the political
 
01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:34.870 align:start position:0%
feels confident uh in the political
makeup

01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
makeup
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
of our maps i'm also concerned about the
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
economic representation in our state
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about executive
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
council district two i had the good
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
fortune of running as a candidate in
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
executive council district two
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
and representative weber has probably
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
heard enough people from stafford county
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
mispronounce westmoreland
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
and that's an apt
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
way of thinking about why we should draw
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
maps that represent our communities
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
where we actually know the names of the
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
towns and the people that are there
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
because if you don't have connections
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
with a community or region
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
then how are you expected to represent
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
the people there
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
and how are you expected to get elected
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
in those regions with no connections
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
unless you have financial resources to
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so by drawing fair maps
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
what we are actually doing is tipping
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
the balance of favor against financial
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
resources into community resources
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
so that folks who have access to their
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
community have relationships with their
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
community whether it's by being active
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
in their local church community being
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
active with local nonprofits or food
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
pantries or being a business owner that
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
has served their community
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of social capital
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
that can allow people to run for office
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
in regions when they otherwise might not
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
have deep pockets or backed by special
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
interest groups and so i asked the
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
committee today to consider that fair
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
maps not only means
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
that these districts are being
 
01:45:02.639 --> 01:45:03.830 align:start position:0%
that these districts are being
represented

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
by a good spread of the values and
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
political ideologies
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
but also allow people to run for office
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
and get elected to represent their
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
communities based on those connections
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
and not just based on their pockets or
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
their ability to send a lot of glossy
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
mailers across the state even though
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
they can't even pronounce the cities and
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
towns with which they represent
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
i would echo the sentiment of many folks
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
before me that we have opportunities as
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
them as members of the public to review
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
these maps to identify indeed if we
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
think they represent the communities of
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
our sau districts of our public health
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
regions of our business communities uh
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
and other types of regions with which we
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
associate and in closing a neighbor of
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
mine jules good could not be here today
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to read her remarks
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
sorry if this is sort of double hitting
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
this is from jules good a neighbor of
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
mine in somersworth some of the people
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
who will be most impacted by
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
redistricting do not have an opportunity
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
to share their perspectives tonight
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
which not only limits government
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
transparency but also stifles important
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
discourse people who do not have
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
transportation access people who cannot
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
physically access this space and people
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
who work outside of regular office hours
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
are disenfranchised when we eliminate a
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
remote testimony and attendance option
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
in order for the redistricting process
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
to be truly fair and transparent these
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
listening sessions must have a remote
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
participation option jules good summers
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
with resident and disability rights
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
activist thank you members of the
 
01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:30.229 align:start position:0%
activist thank you members of the
committee

01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%

thank you for your testimony isaac
epstein

01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
okay we'll move on to parker cook
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
hi everybody
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
my name is parker cook and i live here
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
in dover and i represent myself um i'm
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
not involved in a political organization
 
01:47:06.639 --> 01:47:08.790 align:start position:0%
not involved in a political organization
or

01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think one thing i've learned from
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
sitting here is that in a city of 33 000
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
people this room can of roughly 45
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
people is all we have here
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's because we don't
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
care as a city or as a community
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i think it's because after we count
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
our votes
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know we we have jobs we have
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
families we have
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
a busy life and we put our faith in you
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
folks that when we're not looking
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
you folks have our best interests in
 
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.629 align:start position:0%
you folks have our best interests in
mind

01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
um that not only
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that we'll agree with
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
you folks all the time but
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
we hope that your faith
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
and your loyalty above all else is to a
 
01:47:54.639 --> 01:47:55.590 align:start position:0%
and your loyalty above all else is to a
just

01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
and durable democracy
 
01:47:58.239 --> 01:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
and durable democracy
and

01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
i find my faith a little bit shaken when
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
i look at i know it's been talked about
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
already um but the executive council
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%

daughter a picture of that map and i'm
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to ask her which one doesn't look
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
like the rest and i think everybody here
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
knows which one she's going to point to
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so all i really want to say is that
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of this
 
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
at the end of this
process

01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.550 align:start position:0%
process

stratfor district three the towns of
stratford

01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
new durham one of those infamous
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
districts that is connected by a point
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
i have to represent both towns here so
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do that in very short order
 
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.629 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do that in very short order
stratford

01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
has a population 39.91 according to your
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
map and is equi has enough reps enough
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
population to warrant its own rep and we
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
want one
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
currently we have two shared with new
 
01:49:37.199 --> 01:49:38.310 align:start position:0%
currently we have two shared with new
durham

01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
durham
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
new durham does not have enough
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
population for a rep
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
and so they have to be married to
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
and they really might be married to
 
01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:47.669 align:start position:0%
and they really might be married to
stratford

01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
01:49:47.679 --> 01:49:48.709 align:start position:0%
stratford
because

01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
stratford and new durham are such
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
similar towns they have a similar
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
economy similar geography
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
and they operate quite differently but
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
it makes a great district problems in
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
one town are problems than the other
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
everybody understands each other it
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
works out great
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%

01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
we share a school district with durham
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
and lee
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
and we are so small that our
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
representatives are combined as uh
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%

durham
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that we're not
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
important in fact we are the keepers of
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
the water supply
 
01:51:10.639 --> 01:51:11.350 align:start position:0%

portsmouth and dover
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just asking you to make sure
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
that despite our small size and madberry
 
01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:22.790 align:start position:0%
that despite our small size and madberry
that

01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
our voices count equally
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
to other people
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to that point i would like
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
to talk about my work that i do
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%

01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
that brought me to also chair the new
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire conference united church of
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
and in that work we have seen many
 
01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:15.669 align:start position:0%
and in that work we have seen many
immigrants

01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%

said
the

01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
spectrum of the populace
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we are hearing
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
the voices of new americans
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%

need some new blood around here some new
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%

hear them
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
make sure they count
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh we uh
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
like to think of ourselves as just white
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire and that's not the
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
case anymore
 
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.470 align:start position:0%
case anymore
so

01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:23.750 align:start position:0%
anyone who's not you in your
stereotypical

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
stereotypical
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire idea
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%

thank you nancy next uh former
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative dave dave bickford
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i was worried about
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
ever getting here
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
anyway i'm
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
from district 3
 
01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.229 align:start position:0%
from district 3
and

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really work out very well
 
01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.189 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really work out very well
because

01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
we may be connected by a point as kurt
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
walpole just told you
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
however i when i was a state rep for
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
i had to drive through three other towns
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
before i could get there it takes me
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
almost as
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
much time to get to my next district as
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
it did to get to concord from where i
 
01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.950 align:start position:0%
it did to get to concord from where i
live

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:17.910 align:start position:0%
live
um

01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
so we don't really know what the other
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
town's doing it's like emmett solati
 
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
town's doing it's like emmett solati
just

01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
told us um we're just not we're just not
 
01:54:25.599 --> 01:54:27.030 align:start position:0%
told us um we're just not we're just not
connected

01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
connected
 
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
even though there's a point that
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
connects us we just don't go that way
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's just class six row that connects
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
out that way and nobody uses it the
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
bridge is out
 
01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:36.390 align:start position:0%
bridge is out
um

01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
so if you could
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
in your deliberations uh consider the uh
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
transportation corridors to get us there
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
i was a state representative for 16
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
years and when i first started back in
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
i think it was 96 that sound right marge
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
i was coupled with middleton and that
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
worked out pretty good they're about
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
seven miles away
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
um and then we had the multiple
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
districts and that was very difficult
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
and probably worse than what we have
 
01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
and probably worse than what we have
now

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think i'd rather stick with stratfor
 
01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
than go back to that
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
so and that's really all i ask is to try
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
and uh take that into consideration when
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
you can't i understand the difficulty of
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
the job
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
and that's all i want to tell you i've
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe this is our final speaker
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for having me
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh my name is heath howard i live in
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
stratford uh and i ran for state
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative in stratford-03 the towns
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
of stratfor and new durham
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
as you had just previously heard from
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
some of the previous people uh
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
stratfor and new durham are not
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily connected
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
in the most contiguous way
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
of course when looking at the economics
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
behind uh
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
the connection between stratford and new
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
durham there's far less
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
connection than between new durham and
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
farmington as route 11 is often seen as
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
the lifeblood
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
of that town where a lot of businesses
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
set up around it as well as king's
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
highway a little bit further north is
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
another population center in new durham
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
which goes and connects through uh
 
01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:28.070 align:start position:0%
which goes and connects through uh
middleton

01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
middleton
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
it takes me 40 minutes to drive up to
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
new durham whenever i leave and i'm
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
going out uh
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get there
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
and i have to drive through belknap
 
01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.589 align:start position:0%
and i have to drive through belknap
county

01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
when that same trip as previously stated
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
it would take me to conquer
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
stratford has the population to have its
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
own state representative yet it doesn't
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
and we're linking it with new durham
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
simply because
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
new durham
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
is culturally similar
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
yet when looking at everything
 
01:57:00.239 --> 01:57:01.669 align:start position:0%
yet when looking at everything
comparatively

01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
comparatively
 
01:57:01.679 --> 01:57:03.109 align:start position:0%
comparatively
uh

01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
new durham is far more similar to
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
farmington middleton
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
and milton
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
than it is to stratford and it makes far
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
more sense to put them together based
 
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.390 align:start position:0%
more sense to put them together based
off

01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
as well as the fact that they do not
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
share a public school uh any
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh public safety resources
 
01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.350 align:start position:0%
uh public safety resources
uh

01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
community services such as uh religious
 
01:57:29.679 --> 01:57:30.790 align:start position:0%
community services such as uh religious
services

01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
so and uh youth sports
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
so it makes no sense why they should be
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
in a district together and why new
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
durham shouldn't be
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
put with another town and stratford be
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
left on its own
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who did not sign
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
up that wishes to speak
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
um i first wanted to talk a little bit
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
about stuff before we begin just state
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
your name and where your front place uh
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
david andrews i'm a volunteer with
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
the open democracy mapathon group um and
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
since we are in the uh tip of the dragon
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
i figured i would talk about the
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
01:58:25.599 --> 01:58:26.390 align:start position:0%
executive council
map

01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
map
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
um as you can see uh district two
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
which many have talked about is
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
clearly um
 
01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.470 align:start position:0%
clearly um
gerrymandered

01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered
 
01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.790 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered
[Music]

01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
what we have displayed here is the
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
number so the red arrows
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
display the
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
high school saus that are broken up by
 
01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
high school saus that are broken up by
this

01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
map the green arrows are where uh county
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
so you can see i believe there's 19 high
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
school saus that are broken up by this
 
01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:00.550 align:start position:0%
school saus that are broken up by this
one

01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:01.669 align:start position:0%
one
district

01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
as high school as they use our community
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
of interest um i believe that we should
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
try to keep them together uh at all
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
costs um so as a
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
organization and uh reaching out to the
 
01:59:15.679 --> 01:59:16.470 align:start position:0%
organization and uh reaching out to the
community

01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
we went through a uh mapping process
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
that uh actually concluded last night
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
for the congressional the executive
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
council and the senate maps um so what
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
we did was we
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
went out uh
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
and tried to find the
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
most important communities of interest
 
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the people of new hampshire uh and
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
what they what we found was that uh
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
school districts were very important to
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
people shared emergency services so
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
shared police shared ems shared fire
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
departments were very important um
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
proximity to hospitals was very
 
01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.790 align:start position:0%
proximity to hospitals was very
important

01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
issues like uh pfas and um poverty
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
drug use that kind of thing so we use
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
those to um
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
kind of define our communities of
 
02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.990 align:start position:0%
kind of define our communities of
interests

02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
interests
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
we then
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
created criteria for each of our maps um
 
02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:19.270 align:start position:0%
created criteria for each of our maps um
so

02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
following the constitution first so we
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
population deviation needs to be
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
low um everything needs to be contiguous
 
02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.189 align:start position:0%
low um everything needs to be contiguous
and

02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:29.199 --> 02:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
and
uh

02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
and town ward lines should not be broken
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
up uh we then added our own uh criteria
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
based on input from uh
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
people in the the group um so we wanted
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
to preserve communities of interest
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
for uh executive council we wanted
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
compact districts
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to preserve uh county
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
lines as much as possible
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so what we came up with um using
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
those criteria was this map uh well we
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
came up with a number of different maps
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
that were voted on by a
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
group of citizens and they came to the
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion that this was the the map
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the maps that were presented that
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
they liked the best and what you can see
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
is that only three high school saus are
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
broken up uh the districts are a lot
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
more compact
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
and they make regional sense so you can
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
see there's a northern district uh
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
southern district the central district
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
the seacoast district and a western uh
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
district um
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
and you can you can just between these
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
two maps you can really tell
 
02:01:38.639 --> 02:01:40.550 align:start position:0%
two maps you can really tell
um

02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
one is fair and one is not um that's not
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
always the case you can draw maps that
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
are very gerrymandered that look like
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're not gerrymandered and it's very
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
important that you look behind the the
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
curtain and make sure that even though
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
it may i know a lot of people have said
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
that it needs to pass the smell test
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
you can't uh conduct a smell test by
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
simply looking at a map you can come up
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
with a number of different maps that are
 
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered that don't look
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered i've accidentally done it
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
myself um so what i would do is i
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
when i was doing my mapping i wouldn't
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
really look at um partisan voting but at
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
the end i would make sure that i didn't
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
accidentally gerrymander and create uh
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
pac districts of either democrats or
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
republicans so this uh map here
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
a very uh fair map in partisan uh
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
in a partisan way there's uh
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
a couple lean districts and the the
 
02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.310 align:start position:0%
a couple lean districts and the the
uh

02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
one district is very very fair which
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
will swing either way on any given
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
election which is which is what we want
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
we want the people to decide who their
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
electors are um
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think that's all i wanted to
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh copies of all the maps that we've
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
done at the next um
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
county hearing we're working on the
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
preparation of those and they will
 
02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.669 align:start position:0%
preparation of those and they will
include

02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
the charts that compare these
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%

was online checking i am told that the
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
site is live to upload maps at least
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
today so that can
 
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.629 align:start position:0%
today so that can
start

02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
start
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%

so you can do that and as you've heard
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
tonight from our last uh
 
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:24.800 align:start position:0%

programs out there for
um

02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
doing districting i know there's
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
district builder and a number of them
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
the census data is available online i
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
want to thank people tonight for some of
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
the specific information that they gave
 
02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.310 align:start position:0%
the specific information that they gave
us

02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.189 align:start position:0%
us
and

02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
i think with that we are done from the
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
house senator gray did the senate want
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me normally the senate doesn't
 
02:04:49.599 --> 02:04:50.470 align:start position:0%
excuse me normally the senate doesn't
allow

02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know charts and stuff to be brought
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
into the hearing rooms we prefer
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
that you give the handouts to the
 
02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
individuals i didn't say anything about
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
it tonight because i'm sure that that
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
you people didn't understand that
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
the senate website is up the senate
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
email address
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
is up for accepting all of that and if
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
it is provided through those email
 
02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:16.229 align:start position:0%
it is provided through those email
addresses

02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
and stuff it will be posted on the
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
website so that everyone will be able to
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
see it but again
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of times when you put
 
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
those charts up you block the view of
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
the people behind you so they can't see
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
it and they can't see why you're
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
presenting that so
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
it is that is part of the reason why we
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
prefer the handouts
 
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:38.870 align:start position:0%
prefer the handouts
to

02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know charts and stuff that you you
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
would bring forward and with that i'll
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
close the senate part of this hearing
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody for coming um
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
senator senator gray did you want to
 
02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:51.589 align:start position:0%
senator senator gray did you want to
recognize

02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
oh senator perkins coco i did i just had
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
a procedural clarification if i could uh
 
02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
chairwoman griffin you mentioned that
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
if folks did want to continue to make
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
the comment to have zoom input to these
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
meetings that that was properly directed
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
to the speaker so could we expect that
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
we would receive a response from the
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
speaker if the response is no
 
02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.030 align:start position:0%
speaker if the response is no
um

02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
as as
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
may have been pointed out and i'm sure
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
you were aware in the senate hearings
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
there were some
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
substantial issues we found with zoom
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and it is not practical at
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
this time to be going forward
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
additionally we have counties that do
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
not have
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
