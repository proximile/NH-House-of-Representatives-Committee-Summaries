00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
you push the button on the right when
 
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
the red light goes on so is your
 
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
mic if you're not recognized to speak
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
me we we only would need one if we were
 
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
a quorum if we were going to have an
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
executive session so we would need to
 
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
have I think 11 members present in order
 
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
to have an executive session we have no
 
00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
bills to exec so we're going to begin
 
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
with or without the majority well
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
people at this time I recognize the
 
00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 align:start position:0%
representative Tony lebranch to testify
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
testify and offer um introduce HB
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
1349 let me take this off to begin with
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you chair abis and thank you uh
 
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety
 
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
Committee for allowing me to introduce
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
my bill today um I believe it's
 
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
important to start with definitions
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
before I introduce HB
 
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.750 align:start position:0%
before I introduce HB
1339

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
1339
 
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
um I know a lot of you probably already
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
know because this is the criminal
 
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety Committee what
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
the difference is between
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
decriminalization and
 
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
legalization in this case specifically
 
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
decriminalization means that we're not
 
00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
putting people in prison for simply
 
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
possessing uh hallucinogenic uh
 
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
psilocybin mushrooms um there are many
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
reasons why this bill came to be and one
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
of those reasons is I don't believe it
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
is the role of government to tell people
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot do in their own
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
homes hallucinogenic uh psilocybin
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
mushrooms have been found to be some of
 
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
the safest recreational drugs uh even
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
compared to alcohol and cannabis uh this
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
drug is safe um it it doesn't make sense
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
to me why alcohol should be legal when
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
this drug is safer um the cost of
 
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerating one individual in New
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is about $54,000 That's not
 
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
including Prosecuting them I believe
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
that the has better things to do with
 
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
that money and go after the dealers of
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
hard drugs instead of uh going after
 
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who simply possess and use
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh siloc cybin mushrooms um I don't
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
believe it is a crime in itself to
 
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
possess them um or should not be a crime
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
to possess them itself um we have seen
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
in other countries that have
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
decriminalized uh other drugs such as
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
Portugal which legalized or I should say
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
decriminalized every single recreational
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
drug drug addiction rates by 50% because
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
individuals felt comfortable to get the
 
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
help that they need without fear of
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
um the use of drugs in itself is a
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
victimless crime uh especially when it
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
comes to mushrooms if you're using it in
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
your own home and you're not bothering
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
anybody else why should it be a crime H
 
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
so this bill specifically uh follows
 
00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
what we did with uh marijuana in the
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire when it comes to
 
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing it and it follow the
 
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
same framework uh you can still be fined
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
for having mushrooms uh if you're
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
walking around in public or driving uh
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
but you will not go to prison at least
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
uh for your first three offenses and
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does and I'm happy
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative tesman you
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
rep representative board
 
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
n do you need the microphone turned on
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
is that I need to turn it
 
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.390 align:start position:0%
is that I need to turn it
on

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay how many how many prosecutions or
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
arrests do we have for mushrooms per
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
year in New
 
00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that is information that I
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
was not able to get from OSS but I will
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
say that even one prosecution that's
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
$554,000 to incarcerate plus the time
 
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
and money that we use to prosecute these
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
individuals uh there's there's better
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
resour or there's better uh things we
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
can do with those resources than
 
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
prosecute these individuals because we
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
should be going after the dangerous
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
offenders that are you know selling
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
heroin uh and and other hard drugs uh I
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that the the possession of
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
these uh relatively safe recreational
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
drugs is uh the way we should be going
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Roy thank you
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%

about regarding the safety do you have
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
any uh studies or other evidence to
 
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
present to the committee that would
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
indicate how how safe these uh drugs are
 
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
it was my intent after this hearing to
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
send out an email with all these studies
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
that I have been collecting thank
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:31.550 align:start position:0%
that I have been collecting thank

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
specifically speaks to the claim that
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's safer than
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol that would be good to be able to
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
verify yeah there are multiple studies
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
excuse this time the chair now
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.670 align:start position:0%
 
Freeman

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
morning I'm here to speak in favor of
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill as a minister with the shy
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
Free Church you're going to hear I'm
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
sure a lot in emails or various
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
different testimony that might be sent
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
to you about the safety of uh psilocybin
 
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
mushrooms and they are indeed very safe
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
Professor David nut who is the former
 
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
basically drug Zar of the UK came out
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
with a chart back in 2010 that measured
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
the relative harm of each drug that is
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited and in his case he was in the
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
UK but they still prohibit most of the
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
same drugs that are prohibited here in
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
the United States and it's a very
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list with alcohol and
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
drugs they categorized harm based on the
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
harm to the individual user and also
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
harm to Society at the very bottom
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.949 align:start position:0%
harm to Society at the very bottom
of

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
the list is psychedelic mushrooms which
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
is what we're talking about here it's
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
actually lower on the list of harm than
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis which has as you know already
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
been decriminalized here in New
 
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as of 2017 and the you know
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hasn't caught on fire as a
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
result of that so everything's okay uh
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
this bill goes in that same direction uh
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
P psychedelic mushrooms are also
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic um there's plenty of studies
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's a mount
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
of studies that have been built on this
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
it has helped people with PTSD with
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
depression many military veterans have
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh actually solved their PTSD through
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
the use of psychedelic mushrooms where
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
no other treatment has been able to do
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
that these things are natural and I
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to point out the
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
absurdity of criminalizing nature of
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
making it illegal to have something that
 
00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:57.470 align:start position:0%
making it illegal to have something that
grows

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
grows
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
naturally and it's something something
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
that people humans have been using for
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of years all across the planet
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
but the one thing I really wanted to
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
focus on today is the fact that if you
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
guys pass this bill and you
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
should you're actually just going to be
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
following along with what the you uh
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
what the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
already decided uh distributed I want to
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
attention to the Supreme Court of New
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a case that was issued in
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
December of last year it is called State
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire versus Jeremy Mack m k
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
Mack Mr Mack is a member of the oaka VHA
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
if I pronounce that correctly uh
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
psychedelic church it's a Native
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
American church out of uh the west and
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
he was arrested for possession of
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
psychedelic mushrooms in New Hampshire
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
was convicted at Superior Court he
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
appealed his case the New Hampshire
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled unanimously to
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
overturn his conviction the New
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court said and I'm
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
summarizing here uh 22-page opinion but
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
basically that New Hampshire's
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution actually goes further than
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution which one of the
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
things we love about New Hampshire where
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know we love freedom here uh the New
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution protects people's
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
right not just to religion but their
 
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
right to work worship and obviously the
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of New Hampshire agreed
 
00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:37.389 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of New Hampshire agreed
again

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
ruling unanimously to overturn this
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
man's conviction for possession of
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
mushrooms and just you know it's just a
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
couple of sentences I'm going to read it
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
to you uh this is from the New Hampshire
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
Constitution it says every individual
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
has a natural and unalienable right to
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
worship God according to the dictat of
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
his own conscience and reason and no
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
subject shall be hurt molested or
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
restrained in his person Liberty or
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
estate for worshiping God in the manner
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
and season most agreeable to the dictat
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
of his own conscience or for his
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
religious profession sentiments or
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
persuasion provided he doth not disturb
 
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
the public peace or disturb others in
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
their religious worship so if you're at
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
home or you're in a safe place which is
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
of course the best place to do a
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
psychedelic of any sort is a safe
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
setting then you're not disturbing the
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
public peace and so according to the New
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court that's legal
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so the statutes
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
against this need to be changed to catch
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
up with this Supreme Court case um happy
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
to give this to whoever needs to get it
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you want to get copies out it's like
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
20 pages so with that I'm happy to take
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
any questions oh one other thing I do
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
feel as though this bill is a good step
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
in the right direction but It ultimately
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't go far far enough um what it
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
should be done is there should be an
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
amendment put forth to actually
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
decriminalize all natural things so not
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
just mushrooms but there's other you
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
know things that grow on Earth that are
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
also prohibited and those should be
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
included in this but as is it's pretty
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
Rory thank you uh chairman thank you for
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um you
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
referenced the uh military PS
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
PTSD are you aware whether or not if the
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
VA has experimented and used this as a
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
treatment officially for veterans I am
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
not that's an excellent question but
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
there have been a growing number of
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
studies with larger and larger sample
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
sizes that have been coming out over the
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
last couple of decades uh the FDA has
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
been authorizing these uh these studies
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
to become larger and larger so we're
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
starting to finally see some of the
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
really interesting applications for
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use of drugs like
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
psilocybin follow representative Roy
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um similar to to cannabis
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of um what we decid to do is
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
this would still be uh illegally
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
federally correct well of course that's
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's correct um the federal system is
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
slow to change even slower than than the
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
one here in New Hampshire however of
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
course we've seen as cannabis has been
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
legalized and decriminalized across the
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
country the federal government has been
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
reticent to really put a heavy hand down
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
on the states uh that have moved in this
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
direction so I wouldn't worry about them
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
case thank you representative tman thank
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
certainly you were reading that decision
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
it seemed to allude to a person
 
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
it seemed to allude to a person
practicing

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
religion so do you have to get a
 
00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:02.069 align:start position:0%
religion so do you have to get a
certificate

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
of your practice of religion to to use
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
these drugs I mean I I how do you
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
separate the two well in Mr Mack's case
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
uh he did have a membership card for the
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
okoa church I don't think you should
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
have to have a membership card to prove
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
that you have a religion I mean
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately as long as you have a
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
religious belief and you're willing to
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
assert that uh these things are very in
 
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:27.799 align:start position:0%
my opinion in my experience very
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
spiritual practice practice so the use
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
of psychedelic mushrooms goes back for
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
many many thousands of years for
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
Spiritual um reasons recognize for a
 
00:17:38.919 --> 00:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
Spiritual um reasons recognize for a
followup

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
but you based a lot of your testimony on
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution how do you tie that to a
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
person who is not
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
religious and the use of of this drug
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
not disagreeing whether it's right or
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm just saying you tended to tie
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
them together and I'm not sure that's
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
logic well you're certainly correct that
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
people's reasons for using uh these
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
things differ okay so a religious use is
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
going to be different than somebody who
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
wants to take a drug at a party or
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
something like that um but either way
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's immoral to put somebody in a jail
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
cell for doing something to their own
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
body just on a fundamental basis now
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
there's more responsible ways to use
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
these things and there are irresponsible
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
ways to use these you should not get
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel of a car for instance
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh while doing this so being in a safe
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
set in setting is very important and in
 
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.230 align:start position:0%
set in setting is very important and in
my

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
experience the use of psychedelic
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
mushrooms this isn't a party drug for
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
the most part this is a very
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
introspective experience you're much
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
more likely to not want to talk to
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
people you're much more likely to want
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
to go inside deide oneself and look at
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
yourself and look at your experience in
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
life and it's just not it's not a party
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
drug generally but even if somebody were
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
to take this set a party that should not
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
be a criminal act and it just doesn't
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to spend taxpayer dollars to
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
put that person behind bars it's not
 
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.110 align:start position:0%
put that person behind bars it's not
helping

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
anyone if I may inquire with a question
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in in
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
the bill it has a possession limit it
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
would it would be 12 grams
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
approximately how many doses would that
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
be that's good question uh a very strong
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
dose of mushrooms is probably about
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
three and a half grams uh generally
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
considered to be what they call an
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
eighth of an ounce so 12 grams would be
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
enough to you know have a few different
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
doses on hand in your house and that
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
seems like a reasonable uh limit
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm not in favor of any kind
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
of limits or any kind of drug
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition at all but we have to take
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's politics you have to
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
take steps and this is a good step in
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
the right direction thank
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
Lang thank you Mr chair I I guess my
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
question is I know when we having a
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
marijuana discussion they talking about
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
marijuana is not sure marijuana of the
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
70s or 60s anymore that um it's been you
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
know modified and grown through various
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
reasons to increase potency can the same
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
thing be done with mushrooms are we just
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
talking about you know is there are
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
there ways of enhancing potency and does
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
that have any different
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
effect that's an interesting question I
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
mean mushrooms are such a a strong uh
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
experience I it's a very uh it can be a
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
lifechanging experience to to take
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
mushrooms so what science can do what
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
technology can do to modify that um I
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
can say this I have come across a liquid
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
psilocybin in the in the black market
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
and it's very interesting because
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
generally when someone takes mushrooms
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
one of the downsides of of dosing on
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
mushrooms is that you might puke um it
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
it can be a very upsetting experience if
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
you have any food in your belly at the
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
time there's a good chance that's going
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
to come up so it's usually best to take
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
it on a on an empty stomach the liquid
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
product actually gets rid of that
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
problem so there have been some
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
technological developments that make it
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
actually easier for people uh to take
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
this and and have a better overall
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
experience follow up Mr J follow up Mr
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
chair you're you recognized thank you so
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
again um does that alter
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
you know in any way your thoughts on
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
legalization is if if if we allow for
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
this generic ver conversation of
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
psilocybe pilocytic mushrooms in in
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
making it stronger and and dealing with
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
you know again alterations of of nature
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
so to speak to make it more potent does
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
that have any impact on your thoughts on
 
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
legalization actually I think that this
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
development of the liquid that I
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you is a really positive
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
development because when you normally
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
are going to take a dose of mushrooms
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
you really have no idea the potency uh
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
you can when you look at them you can
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
say well this one's bigger than the
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
other one but it may or may not have
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
more psilocybin in it and ultimately
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's the chemical that we're talking
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
about here that is uh the Psychedelic
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
chemical or the entheogenic chemical so
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
you can't just weigh three and a half
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
grams and say oh well this is going to
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
be a good dose it could be the strongest
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
dose you've ever had in your life or it
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
could be incredibly weak you just can't
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
tell one one to the next but the liquid
 
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.830 align:start position:0%
tell one one to the next but the liquid
version

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
you can actually measure the dose very
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
accurately and so that allows someone to
 
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
be very sure and very certain uh the
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
level of an experience that they're
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to have which has been previously
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
unavailable in uh in the black market so
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's a technological advancement that
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
is very very good for people because if
 
00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
you want to there's something that's
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
been more popular recently called micro
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
doing uh where it got kind of popular
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
out in Silicon Valley with tech people
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
where they would take a very small dose
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
of a of a psychedelic like mushrooms
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
maybe a tenth of a standard dose and
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
they would be able to go to work and
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to be productive and they
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to like curl up in a ball
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
and you know uh go inside themselves it
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
was a much different more productive
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
experience for them so to be able to
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
measure a dose means that it can be used
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
in a much more medicinal fashion so I
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
development representative Roy thank you
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
again sure is is it possible to overdose
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
onde there has never to my knowledge
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
similar to cannabis ever been someone
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
who has uh died from overdosing on
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
psilocybin I mean any amount of this
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
thing is a strong experience I mean if
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
you take a a normal size dose so there's
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
a natural tendency to not want to do
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
that because it's very strong in general
 
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.390 align:start position:0%
that because it's very strong in general
thank

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thanks
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
is there someone I should give this to
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
sport case secretary or something can
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
in this time the chair recognizes
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
brigh good morning uh for the record my
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
name is Lieutenant William or Bill brigh
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
um with New Hampshire State Police I
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
overse the uh narcotics unit uh of the
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
State Police um I'm here to represent
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
the State Police in our opposition to
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
this bill um and that is simply for the
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
public safety risk that uh we believe it
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
it would entail um in general
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
decriminalization of a uh drug will lead
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
to Greater use uh some
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
experimentation um which will also lead
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
to some uh more and frequent impairment
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
in public uh by way of uh you know on
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
our road roads driving um exposure to
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
Children um and just general public
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
intoxication um you it was mentioned in
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
the in the previous testimony that
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's no idea uh no way to judge the
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
potency um of a dose of a
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
hallucinogen um which I think is is
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
something that uh should be of
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
concern because it's unpredictable uh
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
hallucinogens are unpredictable uh By
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
Nature as as far as the reaction that
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
somebody will have when they take one or
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
try one um which could lead to making
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
poor decisions um as well as um just the
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
the general exposure to
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
um to the children in our in our
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
community I I know from from my
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
experience my children have told me that
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
there are already uh hallucinogens or
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
shrooms in the schools that they that
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're that they are in um which is is
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
concerning to
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
me um it's also said it was also said in
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony that um you know
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
use uh by somebody in their own home um
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
that would be great if that was the case
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
all the time but uh in general that that
 
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
will not be the case if it's easier for
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
somebody to possess uh psilocybin
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
mushrooms it's going to be easier for
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
somebody to use that in public and it
 
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
won't won't always be taken in a safe
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
manner with no way to to regulate the
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
dosage levels uh that somebody uh takes
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
we just have a concern for the public
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
safety risk that's my testimony and I'm
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Roy thank you Mr chairman
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you lieutenant for taking my
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
question are you aware is there any type
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
of a um a test that an officer could
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
administer a field part of a field
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
sobriety test to tell if someone was
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
under the influence of these uh drugs
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
nothing that I'm aware of for
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
specifically for uh
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
um obviously we can do uh impairment
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
tests just like we do with with alcohol
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
or with marijuana or any other drug um
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
we have drug recognition experts that
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
are at times able to determine um what
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
type of drug it appears that somebody is
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
impaired with um but I'm not aware of a
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
specific test for suicid followup
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
please thank you so it would be safe to
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
say that if somebody were under the
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
influence of these it would be um
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
impossible to tell exactly what was
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
affecting them other than the educated
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
guest from an officer to my knowledge
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
Newman along the lines of the question
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
that was just asked um how big of a pro
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to call it a problem how
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
often do Law Enforcement Officers run
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
into things where these types of
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
mushrooms are involved in my experience
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
and I haven't been uh I haven't been on
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
patrol for about 10 years but in my
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
experience um over the 20 years that
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
I've been in law enforcement I I have
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
not seen it often um but I do uh as I
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
said as I said before I mean I know my
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
my own children have told me that that
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
they've seen these at maybe not
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
personally seen these but know that
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
people are are using them children in
 
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.430 align:start position:0%
people are are using them children in
the

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
schools representative
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
Newman and do you have any insight you
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
might give us based on conversations or
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
things you know about other people or
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
just in general what you might think the
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
how often this is a problem in the state
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
or anything like that I don't have any
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
specific uh any specific thoughts on
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
that um but I would just say that in
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
general if if this is decriminalized or
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
legalized how whichever term you want to
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
use um
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
there will in our experience there will
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
be more experimentation there will be
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
more use which will lead to a greater
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%

hello my name is Bonnie Cruz I'm an
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
activist and volunteer from Kean New
 
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I found a decriminalized
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
nature in New Hampshire with my friends
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
because I have personal experience with
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
en theogenic plant medicine and I
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
believe it is the answer to so many
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
problems facing our community New
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today we're living in a time
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
of extremely high rates of anxiety
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
depression addiction and
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
suicide and medical practitioners are at
 
00:30:06.029 --> 00:30:06.039 align:start position:0%
a loss trying to find things that can
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
help people entheogenic plants and fungi
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
such as psilocybin have been showing
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
promise in studies and therapeutic
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
office settings around the country
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
already many military veterans who have
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
come back from Wars with severe PTSD
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
have found that only anthens such as
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
siloc cybin can help them such as uh
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
Adam Kes from Arizona uses s cbin and
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
gives it to other military vets uh with
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
his church legally um helps uh he helps
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
vets that are suffering all around our
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
country Justin O'Donnell from here in
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire he contacted this
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
committee via email and he's also a
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
veteran in favor of this bill people
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
contacted are contracted by the
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
government to put their lives on the
 
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
line for the government in Wars like my
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
dad and Grandpa should at the very least
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
not be stopped in the state of New
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from getting the medicine they
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
need for their
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
trauma this bill ought to pass because
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
it will directly relieve Granite Staters
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
from the trauma of being punished by the
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
court system for simply possessing
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
psilocybin mushrooms possessing and even
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
dosing yourself with psilocybin hurts no
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
one and is therefore not a crime our
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
ancestors used this medicine for
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
safely alcohol is legal to possess in
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
the United States and many of us have
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
seen its ill effects you don't really I
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we need that many
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
studies showing its ill effects
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room has probably seen
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
at least somebody throw up from using
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
alcohol and make bad decisions but
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing it did make it safer or
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know legalizing it's legal it did
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
make it safer than when people were
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
making bathtub batches and moonshine and
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
that's what decriminalization will do
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
for cbon as well the
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
lieutenant um suggested that it's going
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
um the whole state less safe because it
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
will be more widely used but really if
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's not um people aren't being gone
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
after for possessing it then the problem
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
that Ian Freeman and the lieutenant
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned of dosing can actually be
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
fixed without people being afraid of
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to jail for that
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
I've seen Cil cbon positive effects and
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to please pass this bill
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy thank you
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
question um the bill talks about
 
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
legalizing or not legalizing
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing the possession of it
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
um the problem is is that the dealing of
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
it would still be the selling of it
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
would still be illegal where would one
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
go go to get
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
psilocybin and know that it's
 
00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:03.310 align:start position:0%
psilocybin and know that it's
safe

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
well I don't really know the answer to
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
that I don't I didn't see in the bill
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
anything about um the sell of it okay
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
testimony this time the chair recognizes
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kevin
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:36.509 align:start position:0%
representative Kevin
verville

00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
morning I don't know how many of us know
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
the history of psychedelics um I know
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
some of it and
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
so psychedelic mushrooms cacti other
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
substances have been used for thousands
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
of years by humankind uh safely and
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
effectively Dr Albert Hoffman working
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
for sandas in Europe uh synthesized LSD
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
for the first time in the
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
1950s in fact sandas commercialized
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
LSD as delit and you can still find the
 
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.389 align:start position:0%
LSD as delit and you can still find the
brochure

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
brochure
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
online so cybin masculine LSD they're
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
all very closely related it was the
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
advice of sand pharmaceutical to
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
doctors to administer a
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
dose for therapeutic use and to double
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
the dose each session until uh the
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
desired effect was
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
obtained so it's very interesting dosing
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations in fact the US
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
government became very interested in
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
psychedelics particularly the military
 
00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.230 align:start position:0%
psychedelics particularly the military
CIA

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
CIA
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately their desires were uh truth
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
serum and population
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
control the
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
experiments were abandoned and the
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
position on psychedelics was reversed
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
when it was discovered that users of
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
psychedelics become
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
pncks and in the 1950s and the
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
1960s the US government for various
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
reasons was not interested in turning
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
average citizens into what we would now
 
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
classify as peac Nicks psychedelics were
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
first made illegal in the United States
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
by Democrat governors of Western States
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
namely Nevada and then
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
California and that was a knee-jerk
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
reaction to Growing public interest in
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
psychedelics at the time the federal
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
government quickly followed suit with an
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
Iron Curtain against all psychedelic use
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
and medical use personal use um and
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
research in fact Federal research on
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
psychedelics has only uh come back in
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
the last few
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
years these compounds are essentially
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
considered to be non-addictive and for
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
the record so I support the bill in case
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
you haven't figured that out I should
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
have led with
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
that I believe in the decriminalization
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
of most if not all psychedelic compounds
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
I am not a general legalizer of drugs I
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
don't believe that amphetamines I don't
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
believe that barbituates I don't believe
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
that opiates I don't believe that other
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
compounds should be legal and the reason
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that is because I
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
believe that there are more drugs what's
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
a more drug you ask a more drug is a
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
drug that the more you do the more you
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
want to do they're highly addictive and
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh essentially destroy lives
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
psychedelics do not fall within that
 
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
classification ation we've already heard
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on the therapeutic use so I
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
won't uh I won't beat that up I'd like
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
to to thank the previous speaker for
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
making note to the committee that
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
prohibition does not
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
work in fact if your uh finger is on the
 
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
pulse of American Youth and older people
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
psychedelics are currently in a
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
Renaissance in the United States
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
psychedelic use people in about the
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
1980s in the United States and we are
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
slowly uh approaching those levels again
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
because of the renewed interest
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition does not work if there are
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
psychedelic mushrooms in the
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
schools then that tells you everything
 
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
you need to
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
know the challenge that we have is that
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
we're producing
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
felons young AG felons if you get caught
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
with psychedelic mushrooms with C and
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
mushroom if you get caught with peyote
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
which contains masculine or if you get
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
caught with LSD in any form and you get
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
convicted you are a
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
felon that is very bad
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
policy because there are no other crimes
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
other than possession that are typically
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
associated with the use of
 
00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.870 align:start position:0%
associated with the use of
psychedelics

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
psychedelics
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
right I think we all agree that we want
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
young people to be able to approach law
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement as well as the criminal
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
justice system in an open and honest
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
fashion I want my kids I want your kids
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
I want all kids to feel like they can
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
approach the police for help if they
 
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.349 align:start position:0%
approach the police for help if they
need

00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
it and if I've got a bag of mushrooms in
 
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.589 align:start position:0%
it and if I've got a bag of mushrooms in
my

00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
pocket I can't do that because if the
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
situation takes a turn that's
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
unpredicted and I have to empty my
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
pockets and I'm convicted I'm a felon
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that destroys my
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
life growing up I didn't trust the
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
police and that haunted me for years of
 
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.270 align:start position:0%
police and that haunted me for years of
my

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
life because I didn't realize
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
why and the reason why is because I made
 
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.829 align:start position:0%
why and the reason why is because I made
lifestyle

00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
lifestyle
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
choices that essentially made me a
 
00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:21.069 align:start position:0%
choices that essentially made me a
non-convicted

00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
non-convicted
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
felon right I should not have had to
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
fear the police if we want to heal that
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
relationship between young people young
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
adults because those are the primary
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
users one of the steps we should make is
 
00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:37.430 align:start position:0%
users one of the steps we should make is
to

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
decriminalize most
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
direction this is common sense
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
bipartisan legislation I took some notes
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
so the dosage question dosage question
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
question is very very
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
interesting psychedelic mushrooms or
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
micology it's a study of
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
fungi to the best of my knowledge nobody
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
successful in um selective breeding of
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
mushrooms to increase the potency of the
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
mushroom various psilocybin mushrooms by
 
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
strain contain various amounts of
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
psilocybin and typically users know
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
which is which and we'll we'll go
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
shopping we'll choose product for a
 
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.069 align:start position:0%
shopping we'll choose product for a
given

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
effect not on the table today but
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
interesting to to
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
consider that the dosage of most LSD on
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
the street is considerably lower today
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
than it was in the
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
1980s it's it's anecdotal I I can't give
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
you the I can't give you the scientific
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
research that that shows that the dosage
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
of blot acid goes down but if you're
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with users from then and now
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and you interview them you'll know that
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
to be a fact so interestingly the dosage
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
for psychedelics has been going down and
 
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the biggest things in
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
Vogue today is to micro do is to not
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
take the large uh dose for the very
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
heavy introspective effect but rather a
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
very smaller dose to try to uh encourage
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
creativity of of the
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
Mind the development of liquid
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
psilocybin or psilocybin carried in a
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
liquid form is not a new
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
development Dr hofman Who We heard about
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
earlier was also successful in
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
synthesizing psilocybin uh in the late
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
1950s so synthetic psilocybin has been
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
known for a long time it is to the rest
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge never been
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
commercialized because the production of
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh mushrooms of fungi is uh much much
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
easier to to do and that has has been
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
effect I don't know it for a fact for S
 
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
ayin I would have to double check but
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
LSD a very close relate relative of
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
psilocybin you cannot repeat you cannot
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
overdose on LSD and I believe that is
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
true for psilocybin and I will try to
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
find the reference for that and get it
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee right remember that you
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.109 align:start position:0%
to the committee right remember that you
cannot

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
overdose on LSD and I believe it's true
 
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.589 align:start position:0%
overdose on LSD and I believe it's true
for

00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
s in the United States it's very easy to
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
produce these mushrooms both indoor and
 
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
outdoor and the possession of spores
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
which is essentially the seed is not
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
illegal repeat the possession of
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
psilocybin mushroom spores or the seeds
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
is not illegal because the spores do not
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
contain psilocybin they do not contain
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
the active so it it's virtually
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
impossible to stop the the
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
production previous speaker spoke of
 
00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:09.630 align:start position:0%
production previous speaker spoke of
Public

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
Public
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
Safety when people have to
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
hide and people fear getting help they
 
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
may need for whatever
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
reason you put the public at far greater
 
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
risk under those
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
conditions than you do by
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing a compound that's in
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
use that's in our society that's readily
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
available right I don't think miners
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
should be doing this but they are and we
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do anything that that puts
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
them at risk I would strongly encourage
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
that this committee pass this bill so
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
that we can decriminalize suicide and
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
mushrooms as a step in the right
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
direction if we think about other bills
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
that we've passed other laws that we've
 
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
changed this is this is going to be akin
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
to that when we pass constitutional
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
carry there were cries there were going
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
to be shootouts in the streets never
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
happened when we decriminalized
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana in New Hampshire pot use is
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
going to run rampant Society was going
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
to collapse it never happened right
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will have same
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
effect thank you for your time and I
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to take any
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions any member of the committee
 
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.630 align:start position:0%
questions any member of the committee
may

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
have uh thank you representative um I'm
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
gonna first uh recognize myself for a
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
question um setting aside the the policy
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not we should make
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
this legal or IL legal from a logistical
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
mechanical standpoint we know that um
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
many drugs are um are sold that have
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
been laced or tainted or for example
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble with with um with
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
fentanyl um being introduced into
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
certain drugs and the user not knowing
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
overdosing and whether or not the point
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
of you can overdose or not the question
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
I have is mushrooms in themselves some
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
of them are extremely
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
lethal how would someone know that they
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
were getting a a safe product if we make
 
00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:33.870 align:start position:0%
were getting a a safe product if we make
this

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
legal and there are people dealing it
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
and and someone buys it and they end up
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
getting something that's poisonous I
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
mean where would where we didn't we're
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
not the bill doesn't speak to
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
distribution it only speaks to
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
possession so how can we ensure Public
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
Safety if the dealing of it still
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
illegal so it would be black market and
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
and like I said some mushrooms are
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
extremely lethal even tiny doses so how
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
can we ensure that people aren't getting
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
which is already happening with other
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
intend that is a fantastic question Mr
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
chairman I I appreciate
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
it some of you might have deduced that I
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
follow this subject rather rather
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
closely I am not
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
aware of any incident
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
where any psychedelic substance was
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
adulterated with any other
 
00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:39.559 align:start position:0%
material so I would challenge anybody
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
that would allege that that is a
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
possibility not a possibility but a but
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
a problem to find one instance in the
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
United States where that has occurred
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
but our focus is a little more narrow
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
and it's psilocybin mushrooms right and
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
there's an old wives tail out on the
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
street the more blue the more potent the
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
mushroom that's not
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
true but these mushrooms when bruised do
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
turn a very blue color they have a
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
relatively uh unique appearance uh and
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
all um psilocybin mushroom strains
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
appear more or less the same and are
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
relatively easily
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
identifiable the it's my belief
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
that the producers as well as the users
 
00:47:29.359 --> 00:47:30.829 align:start position:0%
that the producers as well as the users
of

00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
psychedelics are not
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
motivated U by profit it's not they're
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
not in it for the money and so when we
 
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
look at things like heroin and and
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
cocaine maybe to a lesser extent things
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
like methamphetamine those drugs are
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
being adulterated with cheaper compounds
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
less expensive compounds that require
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
less to be added and the street price
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same so it's to drive up the
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
cost soloc cyb and mushrooms
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
LSD on the open market are very
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
inexpensive drugs because the producers
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
dealers and the users are not interested
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
um in in the financial aspects I mean
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
everybody makes the money um but I don't
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as an issue I I I've
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
never known anybody to get a fake
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
mushroom now there are some
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
hallucinogenic mushrooms that that grow
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
naturally in New Hampshire right uh
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
panel is there's another another type I
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
only know them by the common name
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
laughing gyms and and those are not
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
those are not criminalized compounds
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the the solide
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
so there are other naturally occurring
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
mushrooms in New Hampshire that one can
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
take for position effect I hope I
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
answered your
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you um um representative
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
Bert thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'll be very
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
impressed if you know this answer so I'm
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
asking if you could find out this
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
answer when Nevada California followed
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
by the federal government banned this
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
who were the
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyists behind the Banning of this
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
because I know like with the marijuana
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
it was the alcohol lobbyist that wanted
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana um so if you do know that'd be
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
great if you do know so and I do have a
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
followup thank you thank you
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative it's a good question so
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
certainly um Federal
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
authorities um particularly military and
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
intelligence had soured on psychedelics
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
that they were researching so MK Ultra
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
right was the program of psychedelic
 
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
research and and you can you can Google
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
that and and and learn uh all about that
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
the the governors I think were
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
mostly motivated
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
so so the genie got out of the bottle
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
feds were testing they had loose
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
controls and their test subjects found
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
out with what they were being dosed
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
figured out that if you can acquire
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
lysergic acid you can produce lysergic
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
acid diethyl amid um quite readily quite
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
inexpensively and because it turned
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
people into pings because of The
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
Experience under psychedelics that the
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people have there
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
becomes this Evangelistic Drive in some
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
people to spread the word that if you
 
00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.079 align:start position:0%
take this you will see the universe for
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
what it is you will understand the
 
00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:43.559 align:start position:0%
universal Oneness and you will
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
understand we are all related we are all
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters and we are not just
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
related as people but but as as
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
everything we are essentially the
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
universe trying to to realize itself
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's The
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
Experience mass production began in in
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
in Labs you know street street Labs a
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
bad name right because the the purity of
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
the material was very very high and so
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
there were things called acid tests
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
where um if a if somebody chose to go
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know you take a small cup of the
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
Kool-Aid and and you have the experience
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
um it the peace generation the anti-war
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
movement was was really getting jined up
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
it was tied to the psychedelics and so
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
it was really I think an attempt at
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
Governor's um for a a law and order you
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
know can we just get back in line and go
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
back to uh pretending it's 1958 again I
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
think was a was a very large driver and
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
there was a huge
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of uh what psychedelics
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
are what they do and how they how they
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
work I I can look into it but I can't at
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
this point I can't guarantee that that's
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
readily available thank you in a
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
chairman um you know because I always
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
wonder you know I always follow the
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
money so you know usually something's
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
banned because somebody wants to make
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
money somewhere El it's like alcohol um
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
now the lieutenant said that uh that
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
testified said that his own children you
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
know didn't see any and has never taken
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
it that's good uh but said that it is in
 
00:52:20.799 --> 00:52:22.950 align:start position:0%
it that's good uh but said that it is in
their

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
schools uh how available is it in the
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
school you know is it equal to marijuana
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
which I heard is just rampant in
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
schools so I would tend to tend to agree
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
that marijuana uh cannabis products are
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
very readily available particularly at
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
the particularly at the high school
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
level it's my understanding from Reading
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
you know news reports and and following
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh what's going on the United States is
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
in a psychedelic
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
Renaissance um these these things are
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
are fairly easy to to obtain um a lot of
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
people have have used them uh there's
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
certainly people in this room right now
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
that that have used them uh to know no
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
ill effect and uh and and simply want
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
to stop the possibility of making felons
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
the last LSD rest I heard of in New
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there was a couple of kids in
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester there was a boy and a girl on
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
a date High School aged they chose to
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
hang out for whatever reason in a
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
cemetery they were in the car just
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
hanging out together having their
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
experience the police noticed a car in
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
the cemetery after dark they went they
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
investigated somehow they found a few
 
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
hits of blotter acid on on the young man
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
and uh he went to jail he's a felon for
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
life right and they weren't they weren't
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
doing it they picked a bad spot to to to
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
be because they felt they had to hide
 
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
right and and so those those lives are
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
ruined and and this bill is to try to to
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
try to fix
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
that um and that's why I that's why I
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
support this this this bill the the only
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I would offer to this bill
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
would be to add LSD and and siloc
 
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
mesculin uh to the list but but again
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a bite too far today and so
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good first step in the
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
in the right direction thank you
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
question um I'm sorry if you already
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
covered this but um what's your
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
perspective on uh changing the bill to
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
make the h21 do you think there the
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
drawbacks there because based on the
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
story you just shared do you think that
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
the drawbacks are greater than maybe
 
00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
some of the benefits as far as um the
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
pass the legislation thanks for taking
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's an
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
excellent question right and so the
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
question is you know what step in the
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
right direction can we
 
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.990 align:start position:0%
right direction can we
take

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
adults particularly when you get up into
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
your 30s 40s you know 50s like
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
me you you learn how to live within a
 
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
system that may not approve of what you
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
do and and you can take prudent action
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
to avoid trouble
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
young people are not as Savvy at doing
 
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
that right I mean we all know the joke
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the the drug deal in the hallway oh
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
look you know they're they're exchanging
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
pot I let's not kid ourselves we know
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
what that looks like they think they're
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
being discreet and they're not they're
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
actually drawing attention to themselves
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
directly help those
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
people it
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't probably 18 would be a a better
 
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
better age um I think the prosecution of
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
minors with psychedelics you know is is
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
probably a little lower um I'm not an
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
expert in that
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
but the bill probably would be better
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
with no no age specified but I think
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
that that would probably be um found to
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
be unpalatable because of the belief and
 
00:56:17.069 --> 00:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
I think it's a misconception I don't
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
believe there's any truth to it that if
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
you did that that all of a sudden you
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
know eight-year olds and 12y olds would
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
start taking psychedelic mushrooms
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
most people are very apprehensive about
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
taking these compounds particularly for
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
time because of the
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
lies lies that have been told about
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
these compounds for
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
decades when I was in high school when
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
they gave us our drug education
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
program they made it sound like if you
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
you took a psychedelic once you know you
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
you stood a good chance of ending up in
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
what used to be the New Hampshire state
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
hospital for the rest of your life right
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
that simply is not true I mean can you
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
find a case here or there where somebody
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
has an adverse reaction yes but that's
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
true with almost anything but the vast
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
majority of users that is not true and
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
most people I I believe begin to
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
experiment with these compounds um in
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
the high school years typically the
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
second half um and so that age group is
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
is selected out I I would prefer to pass
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
something that we can pass to allow the
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
data to be collected that making this
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
change does no harm right this bill will
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
do no harm and then once we see that we
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
can look at perhaps expanding uh depth
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
and breadth of the legislation if that
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
answers the
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
question follow
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
um it seems like you obviously have a
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
personal connection with the subject
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
matter um and a lot of your commentary
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
has been sort of um
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
ideological do you have any commentary
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah that you know
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's not my baileywick to be
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
quite Frank um I I think the fiscal
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
note's pretty clear it's expensive to
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
make somebody a
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
felon possessing psilocybin mushrooms
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
and to throw them into the state prison
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
for any period of time or or any other
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
place where they're they have to be
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
monitored or or they're incarcerated is
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
expensive and in my opinion there is
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely no value no value in that to
 
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
society or the state and so this this
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
bill I believe this bill is a harm
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
reduction bill for the General Public
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
public and I think it should be passed
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
question um uh I going recognize myself
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
for another question if if you don't
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
mind representative um with when I asked
 
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
this earlier with regard to the the the
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
contradiction between state and federal
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
laws even if we were to make this um
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
decriminalized in New Hampshire it would
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
still be a federally legal substance and
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
there a lot of ramifications for that
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
long term for young people um so if a
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
young person does s the cbin um he would
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
be automatically uh disqualified from a
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
lot of different careers in their future
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
anything um that required a security
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
clearance in the military he would never
 
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
get um he'd be disqualified from serving
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement where the polygraphs
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
administered um so there there's a lot
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
of long-term effects with breaking a
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
federal law even if it's not illegal
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
here what are your thoughts thoughts on
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
that that contradiction and the impact
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
that could have on young people that
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
they don't realize down the road they've
 
01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
just ruled out a whole whole set of
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
career field potentials that's an
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
excellent question and I agree with the
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
previous speaker I don't believe that
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
the feds have any interest in the
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
individual user or a small group users I
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't believe they have any interest in
 
01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
that at
 
01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
all if you are like the gentleman um up
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
north that was growing mushrooms for
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant use and happened to have a
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
back room that he had did not fully
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
disclose uh and was producing relatively
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
large amounts of psilocybin mushrooms I
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
think the feds uh become interested in
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
that there are at this point many
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
communities that have
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
decriminalized uh COC cybin mushrooms uh
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
specific to no will effect that I'm
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.549 align:start position:0%
 
asens

01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
asens
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
taken uh taken no notice other than to
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh put out press statements that they
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
they don't approve of it and it
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
um you know if you if I got caught if I
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
left here and I I got picked up by our
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
friends in the law enforcement and was
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
found to be in possession of say a
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
quarter of an ounce of psilocybin
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
mushrooms uh I doubt that I would be
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
brought up on federal charges I would be
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
brought up on state drug charges and I
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
would uh end up just north of here
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
um would be my would be my guess now if
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
I got pulled over and I had say you know
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
100 kilos of mushrooms in the back of a
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
van that that probably would get
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
escalated to a federal level I I guess
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
my question wasn't necessarily about the
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
prosecution as much as the impact for
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
example my own son he's 16 and I warn
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
him you know don't even experiment if
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
you intend because he wants to be a
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer intend on possibly working for
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
the federal government because you will
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
be given a polygraph um if you a job
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
where the security clearance and if you
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
admit to the use of for example a
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
psychelic you're probably going to be
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
automatically ruled out and that same
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
goes for law enforcement many things so
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
when we say okay
 
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
nobody not putting an age limit like 21
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
where people have a better chance of
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
understanding the impacts of their
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
decisions um that's what I was trying to
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
get your your feel for
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
that yeah I
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
so I want harm reduction and I want a
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
protect young people because they're the
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
ones that are most negatively impacted I
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we could get a bill
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
that that as an amendment at this
 
01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
time again because of the
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
way we talk about psychedelics in drug
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
programs I don't believe anybody takes a
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
psychedelic for the first time lightly
 
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's it is it it is it is a decision
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
that most people think about for a long
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
time before they make the decision to do
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
that and to be quite
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
Frank the legal status with LSD s
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
assignment plays virtually no role no
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
role in making that decision because
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
typically firsttime users are going to
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
get a dose from a friend and and so
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
their their legal risk at that point is
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
incredibly low right I take possession I
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
ingest and then I'm then I'm done well
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement certainly
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
has been more aggressive about um
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
internal possession charges for miners
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh and alcohol uh you would be much more
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
hard pressed that's that's an issue the
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:55.309 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
understand your concern I I just don't
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
see where this bill would negatively
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
impact that thank you um representative
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
true thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
question Bill deals with criminalization
 
01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh The Possession and the use of soloc
 
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.349 align:start position:0%
uh The Possession and the use of soloc
cyan

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
cyan
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
mushrooms my question
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
is you feel that this also applies to
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
liquid solosy which I assume might be a
 
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
liquid solosy which I assume might be a
manuf

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
should psilocybin
 
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.430 align:start position:0%
should psilocybin
chemical

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
chemical
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
so you feel this also applies to the
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
chemical itself of psilocybin which I
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
assume would be the liquid psilocybin or
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
is it just for the physical mushroom
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
that contains thank you for the question
 
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.630 align:start position:0%
that contains thank you for the question
so

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
psilocybin is the molecule that is
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
psychoactive within a mushroom there are
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
other compounds because micology is
 
01:04:58.319 --> 01:04:59.309 align:start position:0%
other compounds because micology is
quite

01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
complex that also play a role and
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
influence the impact of the psilocybin
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
on the human
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
body this bill under my reading goes
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
directly to naturally occurring
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
psilocybin within uh fungi within
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
mushrooms this bill does not go to um
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
synthetically produce
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
psilocybin which typically would be a
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
would be crystallized as a salt it's a
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's a large molecule the reason the the
 
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
speaker probably is referencing liquid
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
psilocybin is because it's generally
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
dissolved in a carrier um either
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
distilled water uh sometimes an alcohol
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
solution um to make dosing easier the
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
the amount the physical amount that's
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
required is incredibly small and so to
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
be able to dose
 
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
be able to dose
synthetic

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
synthetic
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
psilocybin reliably you have to dilute
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
it so that you can get that control this
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
bill I do not believe uh would cover
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
synthetic psilocybin nor do I believe
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
that uh liquid psilocybin synthetic
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
psilocybin is available um on the black
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
market to any any degree at all I I
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
believe that that is primarily being um
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
used in the studies that are are ongoing
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
at Cornell uh and
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
institutions uh where they're they're
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
probably choosing the the pure compound
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
as it's a little more controlled
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
although some of the studies are are
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
also using
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you to the
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee for uh for taking my testimony
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
and the excellent questions and uh
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.710 align:start position:0%

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank there being uh no further speakers
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
on the matter we're going to go ahead
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
and close the public hearing on the
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
spell and I'm going to open the public
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb1
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
1215 an act relative to the definition
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
drug and representative bazaro is
 
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
recognized introduc
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh Mr chairman uh for the
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
record uh representative Al Bal theau
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
Rockin him County District five which is
 
01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:34.630 align:start position:0%
Rockin him County District five which is
London

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
London
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
Derry hb1 1215 I've got a call a day or
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
two days before our um submitting bills
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
from I'm sure you all remember
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative L blankenbecker uh she
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
was the attorney for um um hired by the
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County uh John cof former
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
judge and County attorney but anyways
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
asked if myself uh or French Senator
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
French would submit this bill for them
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
because of the many issues they're
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
having in the court system in Manchester
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
tying up the courts on certain amount of
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's marijuana or what
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
it is um I sent an email to judge cough
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
attorney Coughlin there and asked him to
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
have somebody here because Lyn Blake and
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
Becka uh got uh deployed so she is right
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
right now uh not with the county as
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
she's somewhere in another undisclosed
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
location doing her military job so this
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill um I really can't answer to it uh
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
on the legislation because uh somebody
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
who's not a lawyer and I you will have
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
somebody stepping up here that will be
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of it uh and I'm
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
hoping that with the duty experts in
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
this committee feel free to make an
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
amendments as needed because there may
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
be a couple of areas on drugs that need
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
to be added in here as um I mean as I
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
was talking with the chairman on like um
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
the fix to make sure that it's not
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
covered in this bill and um like I said
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
there will be somebody stepping up here
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
to speak and I'm not sure if anyone here
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
is here behind me from Hillsboro County
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%

uh support of uh HB excuse me HD1
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
1215 um uh for a couple of reasons and
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
then with as uh representative balesar
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
referred to with one SU question for the
 
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
committee um that um I'll get to uh one
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm support in support of it for two
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
reasons one um the War on Drugs has not
 
01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:39.189 align:start position:0%
reasons one um the War on Drugs has not
been

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
successful it's been operating
 
01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
for 50 years almost 50 years at this
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
point at least and it has become the
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
black hole of government money be it
 
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
State money or federal money and and we
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
just keep pouring money into it and the
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
problem is no better solved now than it
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
was when the War on Drugs first started
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh so uh I think uh I think it's an
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
expensive effort that is misguided in
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
the long run uh in terms of dealing with
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
the essential problem which is uh a
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
mental health issue it's a drug
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
addiction issue and uh you know counties
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
are spending money municipalities are
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
spending money states are spending money
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government is spending money
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
and it's just not getting better you
 
01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
know the opioid crisis is the best
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
reflection of that in spite of all the
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
Draconian in some instances drug laws we
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
have in the in this state and in the
 
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
United States uh there was an opioid
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
crisis you know if the drug War on Drugs
 
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
was working we wouldn't have had the
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
um so you know it's it's it's a black
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
hole for money uh and uh so I think it's
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the War on Drugs is ineffective it's
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and it's uh in the end it's
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
proven to be misguided the money is
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
better allocated to uh uh drug treatment
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh substance abuse uh issues uh and not
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh the prosecution uh I think
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
other uh Witnesses who will testify to
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
how uh how much money this bill would
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
save if we're not Prosecuting these
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
smaller amounts at the felony level um
 
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
which is what this bill in part
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
accomplishes and it also says you know
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
if you if uh the police find the residue
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
of a drug uh uh on a in a container or
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
on a pipe or something like like that
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's ju basically it's just not worth
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
the money uh to uh prosecute that case
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
and I would point out that the the real
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
impetus behind this bill is a county
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
attorney the hills Ro County
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
attorney uh my guess I haven't talked
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
with uh County attorney kogan but my
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
guess is he would say and I will talk to
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
him but he would say we just got to stop
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
wasting our money on these kind of
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
prosecutions um so I would suggest uh
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
and I will draft something and submit it
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
to several members of the committee I
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
would suggest that uh there may well it
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
may well make sense to make an exception
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
for fentanyl I think amounts of fentanyl
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
under one gram can still have a
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
devastating effect and so uh I think I
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
think there's relatively simple
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
language that can be drafted to carve
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
out fentanyl of less than one gram uh in
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the residual amount
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
definition with that uh I'm more than
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
questions um I don't see any I'm going
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
to recognize myself for a question
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so this law it proposes to
 
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
change um The Possession of all
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
controlled substances over a
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
gram if I'm reading this right to a
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor
 
01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor
correct

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
so in other words if I were to be found
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
with a kilogram of cocaine would this
 
01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.629 align:start position:0%
with a kilogram of cocaine would this
not

01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
apply uh it would apply but if you're
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
found with a kilogram a kilo of cocaine
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
you would be prosecuted in the first
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
instance it's very very likely you would
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted by the US
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
attorney uh for a possession with intent
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
to sell at the federal level and even if
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
not which would be rare uh but even if
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
it wasn't prosecuted the federal level
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh you would be prosecuted with
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to sell you know
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
you can't make an argument that uh this
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
is uh that possession of a kilo of
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
cocaine is a simple possessory amount um
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
and you would without question be
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
prosecuted either in state or federal
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
court for possession with intent of sell
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
I would point out uh to the chair that
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh this committee is going to hear a
 
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh this afternoon HB
 
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.830 align:start position:0%
bill uh this afternoon HB
1232

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
1232
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
which overlaps with this bill it also
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
accomplishes reducing the Poss
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
possessory amount of a controlled drug
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
to a misdemeanor it has more more uh
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
Nuance or complication depending on
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
one's view uh has more Nuance or
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
complication in that it makes a second
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
possession of a small amount of a
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
controlled substance a felony at the
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
discretion of the judge so uh you know
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
and uh hb1
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
1232 um also deals with drug King it
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
abolishes mandatory sentencing for drug
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
kingpins on the theory I'm not going to
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
be here this afternoon so I'll just say
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
this now on the theory that drug p
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
Kingpin are virtually always prosecuted
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
at the federal level they're just never
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
prosecuted uh at uh at the state level
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
um so this is wasted
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
legislation uh uh that wasted bill that
 
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
not Bill wasted statute that's currently
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
in effect um it's not needed uh and uh
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh it can it's it's always handled in
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
the joint state federal task force it's
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
always handled at the federal level by
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
contrast uh the feds excuse the federal
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
government uh the federal government
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
rarely prosecut prosecutes possessory
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
amounts all right any any questions oh
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Lane thank I ask
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
you put your law professor hat on answer
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
this question so again doesn't the
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutor already have the discretion
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
to reduce a misdemeanor down to a
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
violation is one question and then the
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
second question is in the definition of
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor here because it doesn't
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
specify A or B where an a would have
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
jail time A B has no jail time fine only
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't this just do the same thing it's
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a B misdemeanor and it's
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
um again the prosecution has the choice
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
or the discretion to negotiate a lower a
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
lower fee or a lower sentence um two
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
answers I'm a law professor I gu two
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
answers um answer number one this uh
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
1215 specifically says a misdemeanor so
 
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give the prosecution just of
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
a uh it says however a person shall be
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor if the
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
amount is the the last old section of uh
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I I apologize I wasn't clear
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
I meant under current law it just says a
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor not a Class A misdemeanor
 
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
and that would be a by definition under
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
a penalty statute that would be a B
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor because it's not defined um
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
which has no jail time involved anyway
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I think it's noteworthy that uh the
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
county attorney for our largest county
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
wants this leg
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh he has dis discretion but what it
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
does is it CLS clogs up the system with
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
these small cases these small possession
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
cases and it involves uh a lot more work
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
for their office and I think as most on
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
this committee know the Hilo county
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
attorney's office and any other number
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
of County Attorney's Office are
 
01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with cases at this point uh
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
and uh that they can get rid of these at
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
the fr and uh in a circumstance where
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
they may well exercise that discretion
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
anyway uh is uh it's a positive thing
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
again uh understanding it's uh it's it's
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
a proposal effectively coming from the
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
hills Ro Atty attorney's office so yes
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is they have the discretion
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
but they just assume screen it out in a
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
fashion representative
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
Conley thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question can you
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
explain the significance of uh one gram
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
and why it's not seven grams or 43 grams
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
what is one gram and why is that the
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
number that was used in this bill one
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
gram captures uh uh very often it it
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
captures an amount that is uh has little
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
effect um uh number two uh one gram
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
captures a a possessor
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
a personal possession amount a personal
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
use amount it doesn't capture a drug
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
dealer of any sort even those lower tier
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
drug dealers who are you know selling
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana it doesn't uh it does it the
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
less than or one gr well less than one
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
gram captures an amount that is
 
01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.590 align:start position:0%
gram captures an amount that is
essentially

01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
possessive representative calling excuse
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
me personal possession thank you thank
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification so this is
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
essentially about personal use a
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
quantity that somebody might be uh
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
um is that um how is that typically
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
prosecuted are they are these plea deals
 
01:22:08.669 --> 01:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
is somebody going to jail are these
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
being just tossed out because they don't
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
have the time could you provide some
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
context on that please yeah
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
um particularly there's an overlap here
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
with felonies first um a a a case that
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh a circumstance or a practice of
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
the superior court that uh tends to F
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
funnels all felonies to the county
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
attorney level possession of cocaine uh
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
less than a gram uh or a gr grammar
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
above put aside the large amounts of
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
cocaine is uh is in the first instance
 
01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
prcu is a pony and Prosecuting Superior
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
Court so it's a tremendous burden on the
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
count attor offices uh and uh number one
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
number two you end up having a lot of
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
people 18 19
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
2021 acquiring felony convictions uh
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
when uh which will be their only
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
intersection with the criminal justice
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
system but it will have a profound
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
effect on their ability to get a student
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
loan their ability to get housing their
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
ability to get into schools um and uh it
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
it it too often because of the
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
overwhelming case load of County
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys in terms of drug cases this is
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
a felony just plead that the felony will
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
give you no a No Time sentence uh and
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's a uh it's a process that too often
 
01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.709 align:start position:0%
it's a uh it's a process that too often
results

01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
in young people who are otherwise going
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be unengaged in the criminal justice
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
system acquiring a felony conviction
 
01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.470 align:start position:0%
system acquiring a felony conviction
that

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
life representative Lang thank you sir
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
so again if I if I read the statue right
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
and again I'm gonna ask you for your
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation is this is going to apply
 
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
to all drugs drugs all control drugs and
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about drugs like fentanyl
 
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
which less than the gram has the
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
likelihood of killing you how does that
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
play into this legislation uh that's
 
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm referring to when I refer to an
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that will help act for some
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
member of the committee that makes an
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
f representative
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
TR thank you Mr chair thank you for

taking my
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm trying to sort out the
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
two different changes in in the bill uh
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
referring to the uh small amount less
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
than a gr I okay I understand what that
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
is uh you've got a marijuana pipe and
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
you've got some uh uh get what THC in
 
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.430 align:start position:0%
you've got some uh uh get what THC in
the

01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
bottom and we're not going to like
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
bother people we're not going to clog
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
the courts with that I don't understand
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
the second part however a person should
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor if
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of the controlled substance
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
is one gram or more
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
so personal possession amount of cocaine
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what that amount is but
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
depends on the um representative true is
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
there a question yes so
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
how if the how is that going to not clog
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
up the courts if it's still going to be
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be a Class A
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or personal possession of
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
cocaine it will uh it will the casys
 
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
will go not to Superior Court because
 
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a felony it'll go to to uh
 
01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:47.950 align:start position:0%
it's not a felony it'll go to to uh
District

01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
Court um and there's a lot more
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility the only good
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
testimony at this time the chair
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
brigh good morning once again uh my name
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
is Lieutenant billb uh with the New
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police overseeing the
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
narcotics and investigations unit um my
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
testimony is one of uh information only
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk in here about uh
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
more or less than one gram and uh as was
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
noted uh with the O category of opioid
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
drugs that's uh an extremely dangerous
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh dose um anything um for fentanyl
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
specifically um we look at a a gram
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
could potentially be 10 fatal doses um
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
of Fentanyl and if you get into um car
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
fentanyl that's basically theze size of
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
a uh half the size of a grain of salt um
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
for heroin that would be the size of a
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
sesame seed just to put put things into
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
perspective for um for opioids and how
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
that would be affected by the bill as it
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
you at this time the chair recognizes
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
rosin good morning thank you for um
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
recognizing Mr chairman members of the
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
committee so um I am one of the
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
directors of the state's public defender
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
program um as the chair in the the
 
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
committee know uh we represent the Lion
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
Share of the folks that um this bill
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
would would affect and I am um
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
testifying in support uh of the bill and
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make uh three points before
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
I hopefully take some questions uh first
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
the bill would reduce uh case loads and
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
workloads not only within our public
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
defender program but systemwide in terms
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the Criminal Justice System second it
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
would allow law enforcement to focus on
 
01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
drugs is a criminal Enterprise rather
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
than a public health issue and third it
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
would allow the state to focus on uh
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
treatment options and the delivery of
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
services for what is often a public
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
health issue rather than a criminal
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
matter so first in terms of the
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in case loads and we heard
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
from representative baldasaro he
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
reported information from the Hillsboro
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
County Attorney's Office about their
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
case loads and I think that that has
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
been publicized I remember reading an
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
article in the union leader where the BB
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
County attorney himself was talking
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
about the overwhelming case load that
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
his office has um we are no different at
 
01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire public defender um I
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
can I'm going to give you some numbers
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire Public Defender
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
cases because I think they're
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
interesting and instructive I think I
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
can safely say that this bill would not
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
only reduce case loads in the New
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender but it would
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh reduce case loads on contract
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys who take our overflow cases um
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
County attorneys as we've heard uh the
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
courts uh the police and the New
 
01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State lab I think would all
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
see the impact of uh of this bill so I
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
looked at um our numbers for 2019 which
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
was our last normal year our last full
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic year hard to believe um in
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
that year we opened up a total of
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
222 felonies that were possession of
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
fentanyl possession of
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
heroin possession of heroin or F drug
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
that I I think this committee knows has
 
01:29:53.440 --> 01:30:00.030 align:start position:0%
that I I think this committee knows has
become

01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
quite prevalent in this state so that
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
was 2200 felonies that we opened in
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
2019 that was 28% or over one quarter of
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
all of the felony cases that we opened
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
and I looked at 2021 uh the numbers in
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
2021 were lower because 2021 was our
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic year still and everything was
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
slower but was still the same percentage
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
27.8% of our case load so this is a
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent figure um that 28% of
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
our cases are simple possession of the
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
drugs that I've mentioned I also looked
 
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
at the numbers for the more serious drug
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
offenses and what I'm talking about
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
there is possession with intent to sell
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
for example the kilo of of cocaine
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
somebody with a kilo of cocaine would be
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
charged with possession with intent to
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
sell uh that cocaine and also sale of a
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
drug and sale of a drug would be treated
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
differently would not be touched by this
 
01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
bill it's a more serious criminal
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
Enterprise so in uh 2019 we opened a
 
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
total of
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
194 uh possession within tent cases
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with those drugs that I
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned and we opened a total of 220
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
sale cases involving the drugs that I
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned so about 414 total cases
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
during that year were possession within
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
10 cases and sale cases about that
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
Universe of drugs so if you break that
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
down looking at the numbers we handle um
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
10 times more simple possession cases
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
than we do possession with intent cases
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
we handle 10 times more uh simple
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
possession cases than we do sale cases
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh we handle five times more simple
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
possession cases than we do the combined
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
possession with intent and sale cases
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
and if you look at a a felony attorney
 
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire public defender
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
let's say that um that man or that woman
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
that f attorney has 30 felonies on their
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
case load which is probably a pretty
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable number for someone to have
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
eight or nine of those cases at all
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
times would be the simple possession
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
cases so more than a quarter of that
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
person's cases so to look at it another
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
way again just talking about these
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
simple possession cases we figure the
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
average felony from start to finish
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
takes about 15 hours of attorney time to
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
resolve so if you add all that up that
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
means that in 2019 we spent 33,000 um
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
and again as has been referred to these
 
01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:30.430 align:start position:0%
and again as has been referred to these
are

01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
quties that are either residue or they
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
involve what is typically a user
 
01:32:38.669 --> 01:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
quantity of of the drug and in terms of
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
how they are ultimately prosecuted in
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
response to one question they're taking
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
a long time to get through the system
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
and they are typically ultimately
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
prosecuted with a felony conviction with
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
little or no jail time and with little
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
or no treatment so you have to wonder
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
what all that time and effort is is
 
01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
really going into to keep this a
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
felony so under this bill House Bill
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
1215 if it's adopted um public defenders
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
contract attorneys um the county
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
attorney's office and the Superior Court
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
are never going to see cases that are
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
under a gram which is a lot of cases a
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
lot of cases are residue or under one
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
gram typically um it would take a little
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
bit of time and a little bit study to
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
determine exactly how many cases would
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
be filtered out but maybe 25 to 50% of
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
the cases would be a gram or less the
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
police would issue citations for these
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
offenses um probably the police would
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
not have to go to court in many of these
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
cases the lab which also has talked
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
about a significant backlog and testing
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
drugs would not have to test the drugs
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
in these cases where they do now so the
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
other Cas misdemeanor as
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.950 align:start position:0%
other Cas misdemeanor as
has

01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
it's been discussed by Professor sh they
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
resolve a lot more quickly typically an
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
attorney spends five instead of 15 hours
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
on a misdemeanor case from start to
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
finish they're just less complicated so
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
even if we get a thousand misdemeanors
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
per year that's 5,000 hours of attorney
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
time uh in our program as opposed to
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
33,000 hours of attorney time that we're
 
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
spending now now I assume though I don't
 
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
know um that um somebody looked at
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
Oregon when they proposed this
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislation because um Oregon has uh
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation in place that is very
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
similar to this if not identical to this
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
legislation um according to an article
 
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
by the Pew Foundation uh before Oregon
 
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
adopted this measure there were 6,700
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
arrests for simple possession Statewide
 
01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
and about 4,000 convictions for simple
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
possession afterward there were 1800
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
arrests and
 
01:34:56.669 --> 01:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
364 uh convictions so there was a
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
significant reduction in the workload on
 
01:35:02.109 --> 01:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
everybody involved in the criminal
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
justice system from the police all the
 
01:35:11.709 --> 01:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
stuff and see if that really happens
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
here um the legislature all of you are
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
well aware of the backlog in the
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system that in part
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
has been visited Upon Us by the pandemic
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
making cases much much harder to resolve
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
for everybody if we had something like
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
this even for a year to revisit it in a
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
year it would be worthwhile it would
 
01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact in terms of
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
case load and
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
workload um second Point um drug crime
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
the Enterprise of drug uh criminal
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
activity um we are well familiar at this
 
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
point with the concept of addiction
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
being a medical cont concept being
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder being every bit
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
um as much of a a medical issue as
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
alcoholism or other things that we maybe
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
more familiar with before we even heard
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
of of fentel um if this bill is enacted
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
you are not sending a message that these
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
drugs are okay by any stretch you are
 
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
distinguishing between people who have
 
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
an addiction who have a user quantity of
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
the drug who have a medical issue and
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
people who are engaging in the
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise of criminal activity for
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
example the person who's got uh the kilo
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
of cocaine the person who has drugs
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
packaged for sale or who is selling the
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
drugs so if this bill goes into effect
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
we still have a lot of laws state and
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
federal to combat the Enterprise of drug
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
activity we have the crime of possession
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
with intent to sell that I'd be glad to
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
talk about if people have any questions
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
we have the crime of sale we have the
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
crime of uh drug sale with death
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
resulting which obviously this would not
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
be affected by we have conspiracy laws
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
um that also apply if um it's a gram
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
even as small as a gram of fentanyl
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
there is still the possibility that that
 
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
drug is packaged for sale or that the
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
police have other intelligence that this
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
person who maybe only has a gram is
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
actually a dealer or is actually
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
engaging in a conspiracy so even if it's
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
a relatively small amount a gram or a
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
bit over a gram a person can still be
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
charged with sale of possession with a
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
10 but the Practical reality is that
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about a very low
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
quantity of a drug you generally have
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who is using it because they're
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the grips of an addiction also the
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
police obviously can still make an
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
arrest of a person if they are driving
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
either under the influence of one of
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
these drugs or if they are in active
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from one of these drugs the
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
law has recognized
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
that um again looking at Oregon based on
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
the articles that I've read Oregon has
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
not noted so far even though the
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is new they have not noted
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
so far a substantial increase in crime
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
drug rated crime or people just deciding
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
well now that this has been penalty's
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
been taken down why don't I just go out
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
and try some fentanyl they're not
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
discovering that that is is happening
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
and that's typically not the way that
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
someone just decides oh I'm just going
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
to go use some fental these are
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
typically people using the drug who are
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
sick and who need who need help and need
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
treatment so there is a decent chance
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
and while it would be more study there
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
is a decent chance this can be done
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
without a substantial increase in crime
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
or threat to Public Safety um and then
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
finally the focus on uh treatment in
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
Oregon um just as here a very
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
substantial substance use to sort our
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
population in that state just as we have
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
here and as here uh in Oregon they found
 
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
it very difficult to deliver effective
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
treatment the criminal justice system
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
just not was was just not the place to
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
deliver treatment for this this system
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
isn't doing it either I can tell you um
 
01:38:55.709 --> 01:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
there is a drug court here but it's only
 
01:38:57.589 --> 01:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
a very small sliver of the people that
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
enter the criminal justice system who
 
01:39:01.790 --> 01:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
are eligible for drug court um most
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
other people are being recycled in the
 
01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
system and are not being helped they're
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
being they're getting feling time
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
they're getting suspended time and
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
probation it's taking longer but they're
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
not getting help and this would allow U
 
01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
the introduction of more funds into
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
resources for people who are afflicted
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
with um sub s order so I would um speak
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill I'd be glad to
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
Roy uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question what impact do
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
you think that if through this were to
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
pass would there be on the existing
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
incarcerated population who are in
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for something that would
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
then no longer be um worthy of
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration do you see a a mass
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
movement of motions to have those cases
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
dismissed uh what do you see the impact
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
of that potentially being well there's a
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
couple questions there represented Roy
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
first of all I guess would be the the r
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
potential retroactive impact of this
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill and and as as I'm sure you know
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
most bills are not retroactive they're
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're perspective so the the
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislature would have control over that
 
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
there may be some people who might try
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
to make arguments that it applies IR
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
retroactively but those are generally
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
not successful so if that's a concern
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
that there would be a flood of people
 
01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
coming in and saying well now it should
 
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor we experienced some of
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
this when the legislature would uh
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
changed the penalties for sexual assault
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
to a misdemeanor in some cases and
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
people were not successful at uh getting
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
retroactive application of that because
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it was the intent of the
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislature in terms of present numbers
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of people who are
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
held pre-trial there are still a number
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
of people who are sentenced due to uh
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
possession related crimes simple
 
01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
possession related crimes I do believe
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
that it would reduce the burden on the
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
county population the state prison there
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
are so many people up there who need the
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
focus program at the state prison the
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
waiting list is much much longer than
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
they can um than they can um afford it
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
would allow services to be delivered if
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
not as many people
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
to State Prison because of a simple
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
possession case if there were other
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
options in the community which as
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful a state as we are which we do
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
you we are we're running way behind
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
hello again just want to quickly speak
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill I support harm
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
reduction uh people are not always
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
addicts when they get arrested for
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
possession of whatever substance we're
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
talking about it may simply be someone
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
who is able to use the drug responsibly
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
as many of us do with alcohol um and yet
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
they're being saddled with with felony
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
convictions and their lives are being
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
ruined um so that needs to change and
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
this bill does a good job of moving that
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
in the right direction my only quibbles
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
with it is that uh I would like to see
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
the amount raised as far as what is
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
considered a residual a residual
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
substance I don't think that would re
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
really be a big deal um because I don't
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
I really don't want to see people hit
 
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
with a Class A misdemeanor either um
 
01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
just for a small possession so it would
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
be nice to see uh either the misdemeanor
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
reduced to just misdemeanor that way it
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
could be charged as a Class B if
 
01:42:56.669 --> 01:42:56.679 align:start position:0%
necessary and uh raise the uh the amount
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
for residual amount that's all I have
 
01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.830 align:start position:0%
for residual amount that's all I have

01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman I am here
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
presenting for the committee's
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
consideration House Bill 1361
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
establishing a penalty for any person
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
who transports control drugs into New
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the intent to
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
distribute um as we are all aware the
 
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
vast majority if not all of the
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
controlled substances that are
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
contributing to our opioid problems and
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
other problems do not originate within
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
the borders of the State of New
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this alone um caus me to do
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
some research on how we could possibly
 
01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
stem the tide of drugs coming into New
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and discourage the importation
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
of drugs so I looked to other states um
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
and I found that such uh conservative
 
01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
Bastion as California have a similar
 
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
Drug law that makes it a felony to
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
import drugs into the state of
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
California um Texas there there were
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
roughly I think over a dozen that had
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
laws similar to this that made the
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
importation of drugs into the state a
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct crime that was
 
01:50:57.199 --> 01:51:00.109 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct crime that was
more

01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
severe in introducing this law I believe
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
that it will
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
discourage um people from driving across
 
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
the border with distributable amounts of
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
drugs it makes their vehicle subject to
 
01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
forfeiture that's going to make um
 
01:51:17.069 --> 01:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
people that are letting other people use
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
their car or having them drive them in
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
their car
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
are um think twice about coming to the
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
state and bringing drugs into the state
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple bill um and uh that's
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
really it I I hope that you'll support
 
01:51:41.709 --> 01:51:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
recognized thanks for taking my question
 
01:51:51.629 --> 01:51:51.639 align:start position:0%
um I saw in the bill that you want to
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
carve out
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
um 2 ounces or less of cannabis or any
 
01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis not exceeding the amount
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
permitted in RCA
 
01:52:07.069 --> 01:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
126x that seems to be 2 ounces and I I
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
Googled it and I guess the limit in
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
Maine is two and a half and I I guess um
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if is there a question
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes um I'm curious if
 
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
you know more than I do because I'm
 
01:52:26.109 --> 01:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
concerned that someone might go to Maine
 
01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
purchase something legally cross the
 
01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
border not realizing that they're facing
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
a felony and I want to know if that's
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
been taken into consideration I only
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
Googled it quickly um I I most certainly
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
probably do not know more than you but I
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
can tell you um I based this what was
 
01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
legal in the Hampshire I didn't consider
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
what others because if someone it's my
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that two o is the legal
 
01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
limit in Hampshire so if somebody went
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
across the border and bought two and a
 
01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
half ounces they'd be in violation of
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire law as it was so I
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
didn't really consider what is legal in
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
other states just what it would be
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
illegal to possess in New Hampshire and
 
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
with the intent to distribute obviously
 
01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
we' be exceeding that legal limit so I
 
01:53:11.229 --> 01:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
didn't really consider what what may may
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
or may not have but it may be worthy of
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
looking into it
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
further thank
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.270 align:start position:0%
further thank
you

01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
just an observation considering
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Roy as a member of the
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee we could have this healthy
 
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
discussion in an executive
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
session but representative Newman I'll
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
question quick question so what you what
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
you were just discussing in the last
 
01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.069 align:start position:0%
you were just discussing in the last
paragraph

01:53:42.069 --> 01:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
says p with an intent with an intent to
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh to sell or distri I guess it says
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
distribute somebody body that did have 3
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
ounces or two and a half ounces that
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
came in and it was not packaged that way
 
01:53:55.950 --> 01:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
then they
 
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
would they wouldn't be penalized like it
 
01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.510 align:start position:0%
would they wouldn't be penalized like it
that

01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
corre no I believe that there's a a
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
specific um I don't know if it's in
 
01:54:07.709 --> 01:54:07.719 align:start position:0%
statute or if it's in case law where
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
they've described what and what is not
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute in other words
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
several things may may make something uh
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
in intent in other words individually
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
packaged to resale uh simply the amount
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
itself especially with marijuana when
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
you start talking about the difference
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
between two and two and a half ounces I
 
01:54:28.589 --> 01:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
don't think would qualify for the uh
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute uh threshold I was
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that the state police would
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
have stuck around we could have asked
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
that question but they're they're not
 
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
here um but it's a good question but I
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a separate standard
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
for what qualifies for intent to
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
distribute versus personal use um and
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
especially with regards to cannabis and
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
I specific specifically put cannabis in
 
01:54:54.069 --> 01:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
here because not only is it um been
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
decriminalized but it's also legal for
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
medicinal purposes and I want to avoid
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
anyone who who's you know going to get
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
it for medicinal purposes being charged
 
01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
with importation so I'd be open to any
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
and all uh amendments that could protect
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
people that are legally possessing it
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
for their medicinal
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you thank you
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative Roy if I may ask
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
since we have some cannabis bills coming
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned specifically hb5 1598 which
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
are a co-sponsor of the bill with
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
me would allow for a 4 ounce possession
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
limit of canidates would it be any
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
interest in perhaps expressly excluding
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis from this this proposed bill I
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
I would not be opposed to uh to to
 
01:55:49.629 --> 01:55:49.639 align:start position:0%
excluding cannabis altoe from the bill
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis um really isn't our main
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
problem as far as as compared to opiates
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
and um specifically Fentanyl and things
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
of this nature um so with the ever
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
shifting SS of the cannabis laws I I
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment represent represent him true
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so what is the
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
present law for uh what is the present
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
distribute I don't have the statute in
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
front of me um but I know that it it
 
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
there are certain amounts and there's
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
certain case law that discusses um how
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
the how the pack the product is packaged
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature um and it
 
01:56:46.109 --> 01:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
touches on several different statutes so
 
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be a lengthy
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
however I will will save the committee
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
um some time now and work I will
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
distribute to the entire committee um at
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
some point today the current statutes um
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to intent to distribut so
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:25.229 align:start position:0%
 
Roy

01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
this time we will adjourn the the public
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:58:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
1361

01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
next hearing is not noticed till 11:15
 
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
so we have some downtime representative
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
pantus it's great
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
person yeah we're we're not we're not it
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
we're just sitting here there's nothing
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
open my microphone just on soone can
 
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:44.709 align:start position:0%
open my microphone just on soone can
hear

01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
me so we have 58 bills 57 it keeps
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
changing if there is an amendment to any
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
bill that anyone wants to do that we've
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
already heard I would always recommend
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
that remember get on that right away
 
01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we'll be making
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
special appearances here just to exec
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
bills if we can get them
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
exec as you know if we have downtime
 
01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:09.639 align:start position:0%
like right now we have downtime but it's
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
three bills all three with a potential
 
01:59:12.199 --> 01:59:13.430 align:start position:0%
three bills all three with a potential
Amendment

01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
reference

01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
you don't have to raise your hand we're
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
not in any formal meeting you don't need
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
to be recognized by me oh okay it's a
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
free country all right
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh if you could just clarify because I
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want to waste time which we could
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
12:15 which is the one that the county
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
the attorney wants to bring it is
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
increasing from a
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
class it's a misdemeanor to a class A
 
02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:00.679 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so it is increasing the
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
correct I thought it was making it was
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
redefining what a residual amount was
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
and making a residual amount a
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
violation that's correct no one has to
 
02:00:18.189 --> 02:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
raise their hand we not in any form
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
correct I just don't want to step John
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
but anything
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
above um 1 oce or one gram right now is
 
02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.669 align:start position:0%
above um 1 oce or one gram right now is
a

02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and I think the Judge can go
 
02:00:35.069 --> 02:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
either way where this specifies class
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
A if I may so again one of the reason
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
questions I was going to ask around that
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
discussion was UN you know the unusable
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
amount to conversation and being a a
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's a be misdemeanor which
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
should be held in District Court it
 
02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't even have an option to go into
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
Superior Court if you're charged with
 
02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
just residual amount be misdemeanor so
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even apply to the county
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
attorney because a B misdemeanor is
 
02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
heard in District Court um it's only a
 
02:01:01.629 --> 02:01:01.639 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you have a potential a jail
 
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
time you can appeal and ask to go to um
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and have the case heard
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court um for those that
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
don't know I was a police prosecutor for
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
seven eight years so I I dealt with the
 
02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
district court levels and probable cause
 
02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
hearings in the district court to go to
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
felony court so um but the the big issue
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
is I mean the big part of that bill
 
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
isn't the definition of residual amount
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
the big big part of that bill is over
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
one gram being reduced to a a
 
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor because you're talking about
 
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
an ounce of coke is now going to be a
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you're talking about six
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
grams of fentanyl more than enough to
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
kill multiple people could potentially
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
be defined as personal use and be a a
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I I think we run into a
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
problem when we use that one generic
 
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
under under one gram for all drugs
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're scooping a whole lot of felonies
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
that probably should still be felonies
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
and making them all a misdemeanors so I
 
02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
I I think that's part of the problem
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
with this bill it definitely needs an
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
amendment to clean it up and when you're
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
talk and using at that one gram
 
02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
definition for every drug out to every
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
controlled substance there's some
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
concern that we are perhaps running a
 
02:02:15.310 --> 02:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
course to the right to no act I do not I
 
02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
and I was considering I could ask my
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
Democratic friends to leave the room but
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
that he asked if if do we need to have a
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
notice our discussion I don't I mean
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
well you depending on your notice you're
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
always most most all of them are open to
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
work sessions and exec sessions at any
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
time so you could always open a work
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
session and have a discussion on it at
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
this time I will open a the chair will
 
02:02:44.669 --> 02:02:44.679 align:start position:0%
open a work session on HB uh
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
2115 representative
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
Lang Lang I appreciate uh
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out um
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully that we can open that
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
retroactive about five minutes
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
ago so so again that that on that bill
 
02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
John that you're lowering the felony
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
level to an a misdemeanor on on the on
 
02:03:06.990 --> 02:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
things that are currently drugs and then
 
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh so but again on the case of a
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
residual amount under one gram that is
 
02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
already a district court so the argument
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
that it's residual amounts are clogging
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
up Superior Court is on its face wrong
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
because it's by definition in statute
 
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
that first sentence says un misdemeanor
 
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
and if you go our penalty section which
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
I had to look up a couple nights ago
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
anything that's not defined as an A or a
 
02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
b and just says a misdemeanor doesn't
 
02:03:35.550 --> 02:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
have the capital A in front of it is
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
automatically assumed to be a B
 
02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor well I guess I I understand
 
02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
the if it if it's not defined the when
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
they prosecute it it's their discretion
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
to make it an A or a B if it's an a my
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
understand they have the option to file
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
it in circuit court if they want to they
 
02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
could go straight to Superior Court
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's so some of the I'm not sure what
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing in Hillsboro County if
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
they're going straight to Superior Court
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
they probably shouldn't be but they can
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
so one option benefit of having that is
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
that if it's an a a good deal to work
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
out is to reduce it to a b that's really
 
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
because then you don't you're not going
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
to serve any jail time so well so that's
 
02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
an option it's it's always an option if
 
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
you charge it if it's as an if if it's
 
02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
in the ha where it says misdemeanor you
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
start with an if I was Prosecuting I
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
would start with an a because the plea
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
is well Lou a jail time this is what
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
we'll offer you but this makes it a
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
violation so that it reduces all that to
 
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
the residual amounts because the
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
residual amount under current law it
 
02:04:44.830 --> 02:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
says it's an unusual an unusable amount
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
on on a syringe or inside a syringe or
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the the needle of the syringe which
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
which an unusable amount I get that but
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's where the whole issue with one
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
gram came into play was what would make
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
is there any drugs that can be under a
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
under one gram but still be a usable
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
amount in it was fentanyl so so when I
 
02:05:06.189 --> 02:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
was speaking the the buzz I said that's
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
the only issue really I see if you
 
02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
support this policy you got to at least
 
02:05:13.069 --> 02:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
emphasize that I was you shouldn't be
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
able to overdose on a residual amount so
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
if you possibly can overdose on the drug
 
02:05:21.310 --> 02:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
if it's under one gram it really
 
02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't fall into this if if it's
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
because a residual amount I mean if you
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
had a a lot of addicts they'll put
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
their drugs inside of you know the
 
02:05:33.069 --> 02:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
cellin of a pack of cigarettes well
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a residual mount in
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
there you can be charged I mean that's
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
not on a needle but I it's not really a
 
02:05:40.750 --> 02:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
usable amount so really the goal is what
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
do we want to do with those type of
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
situations I'm surprised the police are
 
02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
spending their time Prosecuting those
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
but that's that's that's their
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
disgression and so the other issue Mr
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
Jim if I may is that
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
the an element of the element of the
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
crime is you have to prove it's a
 
02:05:59.470 --> 02:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
controlled drug so it's a violation a B
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor an a misdemeanor doesn't
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
solve the lab problem right they still
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
have to prove it's a control drug which
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
means it still has to go out to be
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
tested um if you're going to go forward
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
with it so again the lab argument
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't play by reducing the penalties
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the amount in the lab
 
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
other than you might get a plea deal
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
early before you submit it to the lab
 
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh other than that but so again
 
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
I some of the arguments around the
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
reductions and and it's it'll save the
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
backlog in the labs not true if I charge
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
a violation level offence for an
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
unusable amount and it send I send a
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
syringe or I send a plastic baggie or I
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
send the the spoon they cook their
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
heroin in um and it's an unusable amount
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
that will still be there I've been uh
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
notified by the clerk that we are only
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
noticed today for a public Hearing in
 
02:06:49.709 --> 02:06:49.719 align:start position:0%
the um potential for an executive
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
session and it's not noticed for a
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
possession on a work session therefore I
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
would have to now close the work session
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
or actually you know what I'm I'm not
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to admit that it was a
 
02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
gonna hopefully they have bad memories
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
but uh we'll we'll probably schedule a
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
work session on
 
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
this the proper
 
02:07:19.229 --> 02:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
way hope you guys all
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:39.629 --> 02:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
doors I will say you all my
 
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
co-conspirators though we're all going
 
02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
co-conspirators though we're all going
down

02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
together

02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
the issue is if we are not in a caucus
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
and we're all talking about it it is a
 
02:07:59.709 --> 02:07:59.719 align:start position:0%
right to no request because it has to be
 
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
a public
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
hearing I mean I feel that the doors are
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
open but I didn't write that that's law
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
in the books I mean the doors are
 
02:08:07.229 --> 02:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
unlocked we're not like saying oh no
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't come in but legally speaking uh we
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:37.470 align:start position:0%

02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think representative pantelakis is
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
here you're soliciting us to commit
 
02:08:49.069 --> 02:08:49.079 align:start position:0%
a no intent though I don't know the
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
answer to that but we want to air on the
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.950 --> 02:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
caution because he's hiding in the
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:15.639 align:start position:0%
know yeah
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
agreed so we're not we're not opening
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%

you we're not in we're just sitting here
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's no hearing
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%

02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%

representative Sylvia to introduce HB
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
1296 morning Mr chairman and committee
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
members uh for the record I am
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mike
 
02:17:52.830 --> 02:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
Sylvia representing belnap 6 town of
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
Belmont uh I'm here to introduce HB
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
1296 a bill which will restore the
 
02:18:02.429 --> 02:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
historically significant presumption of
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
innocence to the people of New Hampshire
 
02:18:04.399 --> 02:18:06.070 align:start position:0%
innocence to the people of New Hampshire
and

02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
Beyond this bill strikes two sentences
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
from RSA 318b colon 17b Roman 1 C which
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
has flipped the burden of proof from the
 
02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
state onto the
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
defendant in the first case there is
 
02:18:26.349 --> 02:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
established a presumption that property
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
found in
 
02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
proximity to a controlled substance is
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
forfeitable beyond turning the
 
02:18:36.629 --> 02:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence on its head it
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
also allows an assumption that the
 
02:18:42.990 --> 02:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
controlled substance is illegally
 
02:18:46.349 --> 02:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
possessed while one could say a seizure
 
02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
of a legally prescribed drug would be
 
02:18:48.399 --> 02:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
of a legally prescribed drug would be
quickly

02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
overturned the fact is that in small
 
02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
overturned the fact is that in small
forter

02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
forter
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
cases uh the cost of an attorney would
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
quickly exceed the value of the property
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
seized in the second sentence the
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
language being struck shifts the burden
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
of proof from the state being required
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
to prove its case to instead Force the
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
defendant to prove his property has been
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
lawfully acquired and
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
held in the long history of Justice in
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
America it has been the duty of the
 
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
state to prove that a crime has been
 
02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
committed and it is assumed that the
 
02:19:33.030 --> 02:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
defendant is innocent unless the state
 
02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:34.750 align:start position:0%
defendant is innocent unless the state
proves

02:19:34.750 --> 02:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
proves
 
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise while it is in fact a burden
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
for the prosecution to prove that the
 
02:19:43.629 --> 02:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
law has been violated it is a burden
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
which has stood for centuries in America
 
02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
and rightly so and with that I would uh
 
02:19:52.349 --> 02:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
ask that you uh recommend all to pass on
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative testman you
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
recognized thank
 
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you for Tak my question why
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
did you focus on what appears to be the
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
case of possession of PRS are
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
is this true in any other kind of
 
02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
case I think this is probably unique
 
02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
within our statutes that the presumption
 
02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
has been uh flipped on its head where
 
02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
the uh defendant has to prove that he is
 
02:20:37.389 --> 02:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
innocent um I I don't know of any other
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
place in the law that uh such An
 
02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:43.750 align:start position:0%
place in the law that uh such An
Occurrence

02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
happens if I may inquire of a question
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
involving drug
 
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
trafficking wouldn't a large sum of
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
money be considered potentially evidence
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
of drug
 
02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
trafficking and I I guess my point is I
 
02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
understand the forfeiture of you know
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
person's property without being found
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
guilty of a crime yet but if if the
 
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
personal property or whether it's money
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
or what whatnot is evidence of the crime
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
isn't that necessary to for the state to
 
02:21:16.750 --> 02:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
prosecute the case because if you're
 
02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
found not guilty I presume you get your
 
02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:20.349 align:start position:0%
found not guilty I presume you get your
money

02:21:20.349 --> 02:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
back so indeed uh I I believe it is the
 
02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
duty of the state to prove that money
 
02:21:30.990 --> 02:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
and drugs are connected in some fashion
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
to just assume it that's fine but the
 
02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
state should be uh carry the burden to
 
02:21:43.349 --> 02:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
case if ask for a followup if a person
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
is charged charged with
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
a drug trafficking and they're found not
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
guilty wouldn't they their property or
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
money be returned to
 
02:22:01.469 --> 02:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
them yes uh it would be but what what
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
this line does is turn the presumption
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
onto the defendant so instead of the
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
state having to prove its
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
case the defendant has to prove that he
 
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
was innocent or that his property was
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
held and please corre correct me if I'm
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
wrong I just because I I always read the
 
02:22:27.309 --> 02:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
law that if you are arrested you can
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
actually be convicted but still actually
 
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
get you the money back if you can rebut
 
02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
the presumption that that money was not
 
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
used in the commission of a
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
crime I'm not going to argue with an
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
attorney because I know you're right but
 
02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
in the way you said it but the the
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
presumption due to these two lines
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
becomes assumed and the defendant has
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
to uh make a case that his property was
 
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
legally held in all other aspects of law
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
it is the state that has to
 
02:23:06.190 --> 02:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
prove uh with clear and convincing
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that that is that the the crime
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Lang thank you thank
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
question um so I I guess I I I'm not
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
sure of of your answer in in this in
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
what you said so if is do you think
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
after the state's proven the burden of
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
guilt in a drug um distribution charge
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
intent to sell charge that they then
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
have to and and you're convicted in
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
court do you think it's then the state's
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility to then again go back and
 
02:23:48.269 --> 02:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
have to re litigate that to see if you
 
02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
get your money back or do you think the
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
presumption of guilt the guilt that was
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
done in court proven in court is enough
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
to flip the argument make the defendant
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
prove that the money is not drug
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
related as I understand it and once
 
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
again I'm not an attorney what these two
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
lines do
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
is force the defendant to prove that he
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
is innocent this is contrary
 
02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
to long-standing law for centuries in
 
02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
country can I have a followup for that I
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
think I think there's an answer right
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
here you may follow up thank you so if
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
we left that sentence in there left that
 
02:24:31.630 --> 02:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
whole sentence in there and just add it
 
02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
after the controlled substance lying
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
upon a guilty
 
02:24:37.389 --> 02:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
verdict would that clean up the statute
 
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
to a way that you would be comfortable
 
02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
that shows that if you're guilty then if
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're found guilty in court of of of
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
the drug crime then you're going to lose
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
your your money but if you're you have
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
the right to AB but the state and try to
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
back so once again um and I guess I
 
02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:00.870 align:start position:0%
back so once again um and I guess I
can't

02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
really change my answer to communicate
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm trying to say these these
 
02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
words in this particular statute say
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
presumed to be
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
forfeitable and
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
then uh the claimant shall bear the
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
burden of rebutting
 
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
this presumption these flip normal law
 
02:25:23.269 --> 02:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
on its head it
 
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
makes the assumption that the person is
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
guilty or the property is illegally held
 
02:25:33.790 --> 02:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh I do have uh an attorney from uh The
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice who may be able to
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh put this into better words than I
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
Newman

02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I have some confusion over this
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
also um the sentence the sentence that
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
you and uh and simply uh are are turning
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
defendant go ahead with the
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead follow we just pointed
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
ATK thank you um I'm going to recognize
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
myself for a quick question um I like to
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
when I look at statutes like this I'd
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
like to actually put a a real world um
 
02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
scenario to it if I could so let's
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
assume the police execute a search
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
warrant they come into a house they find
 
02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
um 50 Grands of
 
02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
heroin prepackaged for sale and they
 
02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:45.790 align:start position:0%
heroin prepackaged for sale and they
find

02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
find
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
$15,000 in the in the house at the same
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
time it's not your intention that they
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
should not be able to seize that money
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
at that point is it you are correct that
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
the seizure is
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely valid and um giving myself a
 
02:27:04.349 --> 02:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
followup your intent is that if they are
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
found not guilty the money should
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
automatically be returned to them they
 
02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
should not have to go again and prove
 
02:27:13.550 --> 02:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
that that money was theirs
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
legally I think the the what I'm trying
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
get at is
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution should take the evidence
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
which has been collected by law
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement and prove that indeed the
 
02:27:32.349 --> 02:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
money and the drugs are connected
 
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
without presuming that the defendant is
 
02:27:39.870 --> 02:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
guilty it's always been innocent until
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
proven guilty and these lines flip that
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
on its head so I just I'm looking to
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate that presumption so that we
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
get back
 
02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
to the presumption of
 
02:27:56.590 --> 02:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
innocence thank
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
Conley thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
you representative what is the standard
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
that is used to determine in either case
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
is it a Beyond A Reasonable Doubt is it
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
a preponderance as to whether or not in
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
I think you understand the question yeah
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
so uh in Criminal trials it's uh clear
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence to find guilt in
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
forfeitures it's preponderance of the
 
02:28:27.389 --> 02:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
evidence so it's a lower standard and it
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
also once again is flipping the burden
 
02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
onto the defendant or the property if
 
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes uh
 
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:57.349 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes uh

02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
solve other
 
02:31:16.110 --> 02:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
crimes specifically towards some of the
 
02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
Chang es listed in the statute relying
 
02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
on the word knowingly which remains and
 
02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
removing the word proximity or
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
presumed while I realize the burden to
 
02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
shift uh the burden of proof to the
 
02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:35.870 align:start position:0%
shift uh the burden of proof to the
state

02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
however drug
 
02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
traffickers are smart they're clever and
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
they are constantly adapting to the ways
 
02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
that we enforce the
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
laws my fear
 
02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
in removing words like proximity or
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
presumed is that with a simple one or
 
02:31:54.389 --> 02:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
two levels of
 
02:31:56.190 --> 02:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
insulation it
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
allows them to retain their money and
 
02:32:03.070 --> 02:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to not forfeit
 
02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
it I think the
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
focus should never be to help the
 
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
Distributors of poison protect their
 
02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:13.070 align:start position:0%
Distributors of poison protect their
profits

02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
profits
 
02:32:15.630 --> 02:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
however allow law enforcement to use
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
Endeavors I'd like to give you one
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
example uh that we have recently seen in
 
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
which drug trafficking organizations are
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
utilizing pill presses to make uh drugs
 
02:32:33.870 --> 02:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
like opioids and amphetamines look like
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
legitimate prescription
 
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
drugs so to use an example that was uh
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier instead of finding 50
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
grams of an opiod or fentanyl
 
02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh we find a cache of pills which to the
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
untrained eye and even on a simple
 
02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
search of drugs.com would look like a
 
02:32:59.150 --> 02:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
prescription drug
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
however that person doesn't obtain a
 
02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
prescription they don't have a
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
prescription and a stack of money right
 
02:33:07.990 --> 02:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
next to it or even in the other room for
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
that matter if we're talking about
 
02:33:14.269 --> 02:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
proximity I would like you to find this
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
bill and expedient to legislate
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:22.750 align:start position:0%
 
fact

02:33:22.750 --> 02:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
fact
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement in general in
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
regards to forfeiture already carries a
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
high standard of meeting a certain Nexus
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
of connecting money drugs and other
 
02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
property used in drug
 
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking be happy to take any
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
questions that you have at this
 
02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
time I representative Roy
 
02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for taking my
 
02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
question so with the scenario you just
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
gave pill press the the ingredients to
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
make the
 
02:34:02.349 --> 02:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
pills drugs in the other room in a
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
safe in in making in getting there in
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
the first place would you not have
 
02:34:09.150 --> 02:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
already applied for and obtained a
 
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
search warrant and perhaps done a
 
02:34:13.309 --> 02:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
controlled buy out of there several
 
02:34:16.590 --> 02:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
times would the the money from your
 
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
control buy where you mark the serial
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
numbers co-mingled with that stash of
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
drugs found in the safe not imply that
 
02:34:28.429 --> 02:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
the entire amount of drugs were used as
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
or were fruit of a crime as it were as
 
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
it stands right now if we can locate
 
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
co-mingled funds then we would in effect
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
Conley thank you Mr chair chairman thank
 
02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:49.640 align:start position:0%
you sir did I just hear correctly that
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
you would seize potentially illegal
 
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
funds as well as funds that may have
 
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
been uh profits from a legitimate job if
 
02:35:05.790 --> 02:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.990 --> 02:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
correct you recognize for a followup
 
02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is a question I
 
02:35:12.269 --> 02:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
intended to ask but it's along the same
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
lines if you're confident in your case
 
02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
and you're confident that somebody is in
 
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
fact Distributing these poisons what
 
02:35:23.309 --> 02:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
would be the harm in a hearing to prove
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
that before one's property is
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
seized so those hearings typically
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
already take place uh depending on what
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
level of of forfeiture is going on the I
 
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
think the ask to shift the burden of
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
proof is from a law enforcement
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
perspective when that case is complete
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
and it is for fored to the County
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys for prosecution we feel that
 
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
we have met the Nexus to connect that
 
02:35:57.790 --> 02:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
money and those crimes together I
 
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
think what I would don't want to see is
 
02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
by a defendant simply saying nothing
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
or giving a any reason uh I have
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
recently received an inheritance and
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's how I received this money there's
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
going to be some type of paper trail
 
02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
there that if those monies were obtained
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
legally that they would be returned
 
02:36:28.910 --> 02:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
however currently if they cannot show if
 
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
the defendant cannot show that the money
 
02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
was obtained
 
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
legally then it is presumed that that
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.309 --> 02:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
forfeitable thank
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy uh thank you for
 
02:36:47.550 --> 02:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
one more question um um on the search
 
02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
warrant it specifically would say what
 
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
you you shall seize it does it does it
 
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
say you may seize the fruits of a crime
 
02:36:58.510 --> 02:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
or does it say you shall seize so a uh
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
search warrant particularly in drug
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
investigations usually comes with uh an
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
addendum that drug
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
investig as I've said I've been involved
 
02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:12.309 align:start position:0%
investig as I've said I've been involved
in

02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
Narcotics investigations for a long time
 
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
and what we have found in search
 
02:37:19.710 --> 02:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
warrants when we're receiving them back
 
02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
is that uh certain language will be
 
02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
struck if it is not relevant by the
 
02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
judge before returning that search
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
warrant of course if we enter our
 
02:37:31.150 --> 02:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
property legally on the authority of the
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
search warrant and for example find a
 
02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
gun that we did not know was there but
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
we believe was also used as part of this
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
crime we would stop the search amend the
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
search warrant and once it was signed
 
02:37:47.389 --> 02:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
signed off then we would collect that as
 
02:37:47.399 --> 02:37:48.830 align:start position:0%
signed off then we would collect that as
evidence

02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:37:53.070 --> 02:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
so in regards to specific monies we are
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
always if we have controlled buys into
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
the location money would be something
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
that we would look
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
for representative Ro recognize for
 
02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
followup I guess what I'm I'm asking is
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
do you have the discretion once you have
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
a search warrant a search warrant is
 
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
kind of like an order um from the court
 
02:38:13.269 --> 02:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
to go conduct a search and seizure do
 
02:38:15.870 --> 02:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
you have the discretion to to find drugs
 
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
then see money and say well I'm I'm not
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to take the money does the search
 
02:38:21.269 --> 02:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
war and not direct you to confiscate
 
02:38:25.269 --> 02:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
crime so I've always been a doer and uh
 
02:38:31.309 --> 02:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
this isn't really my realm of expertise
 
02:38:33.269 --> 02:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of you but uh I'd like
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
to give you a situation and and that I
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
think better explains um we enter an
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
apartment on a search warrant where a
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
couple lives the target of the
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
investigation is the male that lives
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
there uh and we have nothing in the
 
02:38:50.349 --> 02:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
investigation that would show that the
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
female is in any way
 
02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:54.469 align:start position:0%
female is in any way
connected

02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
connected
 
02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
the female has a purse on
 
02:38:57.960 --> 02:38:59.990 align:start position:0%
the female has a purse on
her

02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
her
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
has money in it that she claims to be
 
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
from a legitimate job and if we've done
 
02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
our due diligence we know she works at
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
that job we would not arbitrarily sees
 
02:39:14.110 --> 02:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
her money but now that being
 
02:39:16.830 --> 02:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
said if among the search she had
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
co-mingled funds then it would suggest
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
to us that she was more involved than we
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
were led to
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
believe and in that case we would seize
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
the money because of the coinkle funds I
 
02:39:32.349 --> 02:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
question if I may may ask a question
 
02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
please in a in a particularly a drug
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
case where someone is arrested and
 
02:39:43.389 --> 02:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
suppos that there was uh money seized
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
what happens to that money if the cour
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
were to find that defendant not
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
guilty the money would be
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
returned and
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
we've so when we seize money uh that
 
02:39:59.309 --> 02:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
money is is held in a separate account
 
02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
and the forfeiture process itself goes
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
through the Attorney General's office
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
there is as I understand a a separate
 
02:40:11.070 --> 02:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
RSA that allows County attorneys to to
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
have money forfeited as part of a plea
 
02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.429 --> 02:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
experience thank
 
02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:40:25.510 --> 02:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
Muse yes thank you for taking my
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
question um one of the things I'm
 
02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
curious about is the potential impact of
 
02:40:33.349 --> 02:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill uh on police
 
02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
budgets especially in larger cities uh
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
and something I'm not quite sure of is
 
02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
what percentage of an operating budget
 
02:40:45.630 --> 02:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
or other uh parts of the budget that are
 
02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
used to fund uh uh uh either equipment
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
or other salaries or other critical
 
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
processes uh would actually uh go away
 
02:40:59.110 --> 02:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.830 --> 02:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
bill so I I'll will speak from the
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
Nashville Police Department's
 
02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
perspective uh my
 
02:41:10.830 --> 02:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
division other than officers or
 
02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
detective salaries um or gas is
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
100% funded through forfeiture
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
so the elimination of funds would
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
obviously bring with it a certain
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
detriment to the our abilities to
 
02:41:30.190 --> 02:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
enforce narcotics violations I have
 
02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
about uh at any time 15 to 20 officers
 
02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
or detectives working for me and in
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
nashu give our take but it costs roughly
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a year to to run our division
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
um last year was a little bit of
 
02:41:51.790 --> 02:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
a different it was quite more expensive
 
02:41:54.990 --> 02:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
because we needed to do some things um
 
02:41:57.389 --> 02:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
but I think and if you could bear with
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.030 --> 02:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
moment I think it's important to note
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
that the forer money
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
itself is not only used for drug
 
02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
itself is not only used for drug
investigations

02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
02:42:15.790 --> 02:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
um it's it's used for equipment it's
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
used for computers it's used for things
 
02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh that and really I have quite a a
 
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
number of things that uh that that money
 
02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
is used for and so I think that the
 
02:42:32.670 --> 02:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
Knight I'll just project um how much how
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
much of your budget is from
 
02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:50.830 align:start position:0%
much of your budget is from
forfeiture

02:42:50.830 --> 02:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:53.469 --> 02:42:53.479 align:start position:0%
money the the police department's budget
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
in general yes
 
02:42:59.309 --> 02:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
so forfeiture is held
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it can be used for law enforcement
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
purposes but it cannot be used to to
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
maintain a budget the the annual budget
 
02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
of the police department that's done
 
02:43:11.389 --> 02:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:14.510 --> 02:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
Nashua you recognize for a followup I'm
 
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'll take another stab at this
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
um do you know how much police funds you
 
02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
get roughly about if it changes every
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
year from last year how much you
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
specifically receive for your department
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
based off of forfeit your
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
money so on the types of Investigations
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:42.990 --> 02:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
compl completed uh and from year to year
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
that that number fluctuates
 
02:43:51.389 --> 02:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:58.750 --> 02:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you for taking my question
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I uh was just curious if you can't
 
02:44:05.309 --> 02:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
account like anticipate the
 
02:44:09.070 --> 02:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
amount how do you plan the use of it and
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
how is it factored into you know setting
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
the budget I guess it's just um like if
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
I was setting my budget and I knew I
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
might get some money but not sure how
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
much I don't think I could make plans
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
for how to use it so how does that work
 
02:44:28.110 --> 02:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
and how does that fold into the idea
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
that that the result of passing this
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislation would be a budget
 
02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
cut thank you so I guess to answer your
 
02:44:39.389 --> 02:44:39.399 align:start position:0%
question I I wouldn't I wouldn't
 
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily say it's a budget cut uh
 
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
because I view the budget as something
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
that the city issues but our operating
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
expenses come from Fort fure within my
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
division the Narcotics Division
 
02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:53.630 align:start position:0%
division the Narcotics Division
specifically

02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
and in every year that I've been there
 
02:44:59.070 --> 02:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
we have been able to maintain
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
um maintain our
 
02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
numbers that we continue to
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
operate I think like anything else if
 
02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh a tree fell on my house I would have
 
02:45:14.309 --> 02:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
to find the money from somewhere and
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
maybe I wouldn't go on vacation that
 
02:45:18.550 --> 02:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
year I I guess that would be an example
 
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
so on Lower years we are paying more
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
attention to how much money we are
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
spending for drug investigations or
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
money that we give out to for their
 
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
um memberships to the you know their
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
tools

02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
tools
 
02:45:48.349 --> 02:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
answering my question I'm looking at
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
this paragraph paragraph C is only
 
02:45:58.670 --> 02:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
pertaining to uh currency coins
 
02:46:01.630 --> 02:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
Securities and it basically talks about
 
02:46:04.110 --> 02:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
two different kinds any that
 
02:46:09.070 --> 02:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
are uh used intended to use for rec
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
recruitment manufacturer compounding
 
02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
processing etc etc and the next has it
 
02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
says all monies coins currencies Neal
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
instruments and securities found in
 
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
proximity now couldn't we make the
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
argument that any Securities found in
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
proximity were part of the
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and does it is it is that
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:41.230 --> 02:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
necessary I think that that sentence is
 
02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessary because of the word
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
proximity and and in parts of my
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
original when I originally started
 
02:46:52.389 --> 02:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
relying on the
 
02:46:54.590 --> 02:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
knowingly and removing the word
 
02:46:59.630 --> 02:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
proximity I I worry that we are allowing
 
02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:00.830 align:start position:0%
proximity I I worry that we are allowing
potential

02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
defendants uh avenues that onsite they
 
02:47:08.429 --> 02:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
can say that those are legitimate funds
 
02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
and even if they are found in proximity
 
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
to the drugs and it takes a tool away
 
02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement
 
02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
whereas if down the road those funds are
 
02:47:21.750 --> 02:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
in fact proved to be legitimate they get
 
02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
returned but if that defendant does not
 
02:47:26.349 --> 02:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
have an explanation for where that
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
funding came from there is no paper
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
trail or we've done our due diligence
 
02:47:35.070 --> 02:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
proving comingled funds money money
 
02:47:38.590 --> 02:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
used during the investigation we show
 
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
that based on the preponderance of the
 
02:47:42.950 --> 02:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that it was in fact drug
 
02:47:46.190 --> 02:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
related and these things I think
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
are at times very easy to show someone
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
with no job no source of income no means
 
02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
of of obtaining any money and yet they
 
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.429 --> 02:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
it representative board you recognize
 
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
for a followup thank you so um it's it's
 
02:48:13.590 --> 02:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
unclear that it's necessary but we'll
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
grant you that look at the last
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
sentences CL of the property will bear
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
you it appears to me that if this
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
sentence is not there then they claim it
 
02:48:40.990 --> 02:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
back in that
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph and what's the question to
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
that sir I I'm I'm asking if
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
not so I think the the the sticking
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
point on the bill seems to be the the
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
burden of proof and where where shall
 
02:49:01.279 --> 02:49:03.070 align:start position:0%
burden of proof and where where shall
that

02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
lie and from my standpoint and and
 
02:49:10.510 --> 02:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
standpoint I think that in order for us
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
to seize the money we've already had to
 
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
show quite the Nexus to a drug
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
investigation so before we would even
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
seize it we we know it exists therefore
 
02:49:26.269 --> 02:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
we are making that representation that
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
that this money is drug related it is
 
02:49:31.229 --> 02:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
seized and if that defendant wants to
 
02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
show that it is not drug proceeds then
 
02:49:39.229 --> 02:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:50.110 align:start position:0%
 
Newman

02:49:50.110 --> 02:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
let me repeat what I said because my mic
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
was not on this is in reference to your
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
last sentence about where where you
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's been an investigation and there
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
is an ex exis between whatever the
 
02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
situation is and
 
02:50:07.389 --> 02:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:50:07.399 --> 02:50:09.110 align:start position:0%
and the
forfeiture

02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
and but but then the offend the
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
defendant in a case where he's been uted
 
02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
by the state has to prove that the state
 
02:50:20.110 --> 02:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
is wrong and like this previous
 
02:50:22.269 --> 02:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
testimony said representative Newman is
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
there a
 
02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
question one more sence previous I'm
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the testimony testimony
 
02:50:30.269 --> 02:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
previously said
 
02:50:33.830 --> 02:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
that that that this is the only place
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that they see does is does
 
02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
the I don't believe that the defendant
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
should have to prove it and do You'
 
02:50:44.309 --> 02:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
agree with that I guess that's the best
 
02:50:44.319 --> 02:50:47.790 align:start position:0%
agree with that I guess that's the best
way

02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
well being in opposition of the pill the
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
bill I do believe that the defendant
 
02:50:52.750 --> 02:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
should have to prove it because I
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
believe law
 
02:50:57.710 --> 02:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement by seizing the money they
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
feel they've met their burden of showing
 
02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
that there is a Nexus and that the the
 
02:51:04.030 --> 02:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
proceeds were illegally
 
02:51:08.990 --> 02:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you for your
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and for taking our
 
02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:22.269 align:start position:0%
testimony and for taking our
questions

02:51:22.269 --> 02:51:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:23.950 --> 02:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
this time the chair is
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
recognizing Dennis and do I apolog I
 
02:51:30.750 --> 02:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
can't read the last name but Dennis from
 
02:51:34.030 --> 02:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield my name is Dennis Corgan
 
02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm representing myself I'm a
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire and um I've
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
worked on asset for forfeiture
 
02:51:44.910 --> 02:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislation for six or seven years uh
 
02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
this this legislation has um been in
 
02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
place since I think
 
02:51:55.229 --> 02:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
2011 and um it's um required some
 
02:51:57.309 --> 02:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
modifications as time's gone on and this
 
02:52:02.590 --> 02:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
is what this bill is is um is meant to
 
02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
do let me just say that I think there's
 
02:52:11.150 --> 02:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
a uh potential confusion in how these um
 
02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
cases arise it it's not always the case
 
02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a a warrant that's issued
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
or um a person who's found guilty uh at
 
02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
all often um there's really two separate
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
tracks that the investigation proceeds
 
02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
along one to prove that a person is
 
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
innocent or guilty and secondarily to
 
02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
prove that the property involved is
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
innocent to guilty this could be money
 
02:52:45.229 --> 02:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
it could
 
02:52:49.550 --> 02:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
be houses computers cars and these are
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
um often seized um and
 
02:52:58.349 --> 02:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
then later on the um the prosecutor will
 
02:53:01.510 --> 02:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
will show that they are uh or not that
 
02:53:06.190 --> 02:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
so the property can be a judged to be
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
guilty in independent of whether anyone
 
02:53:20.710 --> 02:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
is is found guilty of a
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
crime um one other point I'd just like
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
to make quickly is that uh we've been
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
hearing about how if a mistake is made
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
and the money has been forfeited
 
02:53:39.750 --> 02:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
incorrectly that the claimant can um can
 
02:53:42.190 --> 02:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
get the money back if if it's if it's
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
his the problem with that argument is
 
02:53:49.030 --> 02:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
that many many of these forfeitures of
 
02:53:51.790 --> 02:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
money in particular are for relatively
 
02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:52.750 align:start position:0%
money in particular are for relatively
small

02:53:52.750 --> 02:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:53:57.269 --> 02:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
amounts uh on the order of $1,000 and
 
02:54:02.429 --> 02:54:02.439 align:start position:0%
when the uh claimants consider the
 
02:54:06.510 --> 02:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
advisability of seeking to to get that
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
money back they've got to recognize that
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to have legal uh costs to
 
02:54:16.429 --> 02:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
to take into account to make it
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
questionable as to whether it's
 
02:54:20.910 --> 02:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile on a net basis for them to
 
02:54:23.389 --> 02:54:23.399 align:start position:0%
apply for that money
 
02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
back those are the two main uh comments
 
02:54:29.229 --> 02:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make at this point thank
 
02:54:32.469 --> 02:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
you if I could ask a question
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
please so it was it your testimony that
 
02:54:38.110 --> 02:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances where a
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
person defendant goes to trial is found
 
02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
not guilty but they don't have their
 
02:54:46.030 --> 02:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
money that was se's Return to them I'm
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
more thinking of the situation of a
 
02:54:52.269 --> 02:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
roadside stop where there is no um
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
warrant issued where the where money is
 
02:54:58.750 --> 02:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
seized and that's the end of the um of
 
02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:03.630 align:start position:0%
seized and that's the end of the um of
the

02:55:03.630 --> 02:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
process and if I may ask you follow so
 
02:55:07.710 --> 02:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about circumstance where
 
02:55:09.710 --> 02:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
the money was seized but the person was
 
02:55:11.550 --> 02:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
never formally charged with the correct
 
02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:13.190 align:start position:0%
never formally charged with the correct
correct

02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
right and if I me ask this one other
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
followup would there
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
be do you have any opinion on the idea
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
if there was any language added in a
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
potential amendment that if the if an
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
individual is found not guilty and not
 
02:55:33.870 --> 02:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
prosecuted that any money sees would be
 
02:55:35.790 --> 02:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
returned I'm not sure if I understand
 
02:55:37.389 --> 02:55:37.399 align:start position:0%
the question sorry what I was asking is
 
02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
if a per if if there was language added
 
02:55:42.030 --> 02:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
to the to the law that if a person is
 
02:55:43.950 --> 02:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
found not guilty or not ever charged
 
02:55:46.670 --> 02:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
with any crime any money seeds would be
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
returned I think that'd be a great
 
02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement absolutely
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you representative
 
02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:54.950 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you representative

Knight thank you chair thanks for taking
 
02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
my question um I have one in a
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
followup in your years of expertise how
 
02:56:09.870 --> 02:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
often do you uh estimate that
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
roadside um confiscation of money
 
02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:15.590 align:start position:0%
roadside um confiscation of money
happens

02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
happens
 
02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to know um certainly in
 
02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:20.110 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to know um certainly in
other

02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions we see this happening
 
02:56:28.349 --> 02:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
regularly but I can't give you numbers
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
or evidence about the particulars of New
 
02:56:31.439 --> 02:56:34.070 align:start position:0%
or evidence about the particulars of New
Hampshire

02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:56:38.830 --> 02:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
situations and chair can I ask a
 
02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:45.510 --> 02:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
recognize would you suggest the use of
 
02:56:48.229 --> 02:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
body warn cameras on police officers
 
02:56:52.750 --> 02:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
would crack down on activities such as
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah I think that would be a a
 
02:56:55.200 --> 02:57:03.110 align:start position:0%
that yeah I think that would be a a
reasonable

02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
your are you saying that police officer
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
stopped somebody on the side of the road
 
02:57:19.630 --> 02:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
and they take their money that it's they
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
they don't give it back is that what
 
02:57:21.439 --> 02:57:23.110 align:start position:0%
they don't give it back is that what
you're

02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:57:26.030 --> 02:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
saying well yes they that is what I'm
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying because they need to make an
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
application to to get the money back and
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
I'm saying if it's a small amount often
 
02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's not an economic uh idea to to work
 
02:57:40.510 --> 02:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
that way the claimant may decide to just
 
02:57:43.349 --> 02:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
let go of any claim on on that money
 
02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
because they are not going to net back
 
02:57:48.110 --> 02:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
very much after they've paid a lawyer to
 
02:57:50.150 --> 02:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
to help them in
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
02:57:55.630 --> 02:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
02:58:06.510 --> 02:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:17.190 --> 02:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
D thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
02:58:21.229 --> 02:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Maguire and I'm from
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
Epsom I was a state representative when
 
02:58:30.229 --> 02:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
we started um reforming this area of New
 
02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law maybe eight years ago or
 
02:58:36.630 --> 02:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
so and um I think first of all there's
 
02:58:39.710 --> 02:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
been a number of questions about um
 
02:58:42.790 --> 02:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
amounts of money and and so on the next
 
02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill you're going to hear is about
 
02:58:48.229 --> 02:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
reporting and so the people that will
 
02:58:50.830 --> 02:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
testify on that have the current set of
 
02:58:53.349 --> 02:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
reports and so they can answer questions
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
about how much does nasua uh forfeit and
 
02:58:58.910 --> 02:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
and so on things like that so so I would
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
suggest on the next bill you ask Reas
 
02:59:04.349 --> 02:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
those questions this particular bill is
 
02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
is fairly simple and it's it's just
 
02:59:08.469 --> 02:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
about these two removing these two
 
02:59:11.309 --> 02:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
sentences from New Hampshire law and
 
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with the way we've
 
02:59:16.269 --> 02:59:16.279 align:start position:0%
been improving New Hampshire law on
 
02:59:19.469 --> 02:59:19.479 align:start position:0%
forfeiture over the years in general
 
02:59:22.229 --> 02:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
what we've done is switch it from a
 
02:59:24.070 --> 02:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
system where there is what's called
 
02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:25.110 align:start position:0%
system where there is what's called
civil

02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
civil
 
02:59:27.710 --> 02:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
forfeiture um which just means that
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
there's effectively a a case against
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
forfeited property that's a civil case
 
02:59:36.950 --> 02:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't require um it has a lower
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
burden of proof um it only requires uh
 
02:59:45.349 --> 02:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence not not um
 
02:59:49.670 --> 02:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
um proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt um
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it it because it's only a civil case
 
02:59:56.190 --> 02:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
then um Indigent defendants are not
 
02:59:59.349 --> 02:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
granted an attorney uh to to help defend
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
themselves and so on and and our and
 
03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
what we've done over the years is switch
 
03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
over to criminal uh forfeiture which
 
03:00:09.150 --> 03:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
means number one if property is going to
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
be forfeited under New Hampshire law
 
03:00:15.030 --> 03:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
then um you must have a criminal
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
conviction of the person for an
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
underlying crime first and then
 
03:00:23.950 --> 03:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of of property used um in
 
03:00:26.510 --> 03:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
those cases can be forfeited right so
 
03:00:30.190 --> 03:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
you can't simply forfeit money without
 
03:00:33.150 --> 03:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
also having a criminal conviction so
 
03:00:38.429 --> 03:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill simply says um it
 
03:00:41.349 --> 03:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
goes along with that by saying if you're
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
going to Forfeit something you you have
 
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
to prove um like in a criminal case that
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
that this thing was um used for the
 
03:00:54.429 --> 03:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
crime right that's what the the words
 
03:00:57.150 --> 03:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
traceable there too means in the in the
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
previous sentence so whereas current law
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
the things that are being crossed out
 
03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
here is sort of the opposite it's kind
 
03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
of like guilty until proven innocent
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
right it says that the presumption is
 
03:01:14.389 --> 03:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
you prove to me that that this uh prop
 
03:01:17.070 --> 03:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
was not used for this for this crime
 
03:01:20.990 --> 03:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
right I mean I I have in my pocket here
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:01:25.910 --> 03:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
$200 um if if this was seized how do I
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
prove that I didn't get this from
 
03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
selling drugs right I mean I I know that
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
I took it out of the ATM but you know
 
03:01:36.790 --> 03:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
that could have been other money right I
 
03:01:39.309 --> 03:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
mean how do you prove it so so really
 
03:01:40.830 --> 03:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's the burden of proof should be on
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor to prove that this prop
 
03:01:46.750 --> 03:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
this car was used to sell drugs this
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
this uh money came as the result of
 
03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
drugs and so on that's that's the normal
 
03:01:53.630 --> 03:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
sort of thing right so so um in general
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been doing with New
 
03:01:56.790 --> 03:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is we're saying if you're
 
03:01:58.670 --> 03:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
going to be punished by having your
 
03:01:58.680 --> 03:01:59.750 align:start position:0%
going to be punished by having your
property

03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:02:02.110 --> 03:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
taken um it the burden of proof should
 
03:02:04.349 --> 03:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
be on the prosecutor to prove that you
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
committed the
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
chair representative Burt thank you
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
03:02:16.750 --> 03:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:02:19.950 --> 03:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
testimony why in your opinion would the
 
03:02:23.910 --> 03:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
police be so against this when it really
 
03:02:26.830 --> 03:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do is you know if
 
03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
I have cash which I do occasionally and
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
I get it seized
 
03:02:35.150 --> 03:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
um how do I prove where that cash came
 
03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
from and I don't do drugs well yes thank
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative just
 
03:02:45.150 --> 03:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
in general the current system allows uh
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
police even under New Hampshire law I
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
mean both the thing is there's
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
forfeiture under federal law and under
 
03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law and that's the subject
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
of another bill that's over in judiciary
 
03:03:00.309 --> 03:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
at the moment but um but the in general
 
03:03:02.429 --> 03:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
the there are incentives built into the
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
law um for for forfeiture to take place
 
03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
because the results of forfeiture are
 
03:03:12.830 --> 03:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
then um a significant part of them are
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
given to police departments and they're
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to spend that money um sort of
 
03:03:20.830 --> 03:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
off Budget on things that they decide
 
03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
that they want to spend on that have not
 
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily gone through the budget
 
03:03:30.750 --> 03:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
incentives thank you uh I'm going to
 
03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
recognize myself for a question um so
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
when we lay out a crime in the
 
03:03:41.630 --> 03:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
legislature we we have to or at least we
 
03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
should put the the elements of that
 
03:03:46.870 --> 03:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
crime um for the police to
 
03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
prove so in in kind of culling this
 
03:03:52.590 --> 03:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
money away from the the crime of the of
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
the possession with intent and saying
 
03:03:57.429 --> 03:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
okay now police you've proved that I
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
sell drugs now you have to prove the
 
03:04:02.349 --> 03:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
money you found was also um related to
 
03:04:05.630 --> 03:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
those drug sales um how would the police
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
go about doing that if and unless they
 
03:04:09.710 --> 03:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
happen to be lucky enough to have some
 
03:04:11.110 --> 03:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
co-mingled funds in there from a
 
03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
controlled buy how could law enforcement
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
proved that that money was in fact a
 
03:04:18.190 --> 03:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
fruit of the crime and it should be
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
subject to Forfeit yes thank you for the
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
question representative um my
 
03:04:26.229 --> 03:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is they can uh do
 
03:04:28.110 --> 03:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
Discovery right like in any criminal
 
03:04:33.070 --> 03:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
trial you can you can go and um get
 
03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:35.030 align:start position:0%
trial you can you can go and um get
people's

03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
people's
 
03:04:40.110 --> 03:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
um um wage uh Records right you can you
 
03:04:43.389 --> 03:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
can um you can uh if they run a business
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
business get the business records things
 
03:04:48.429 --> 03:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
like that and they can they can show
 
03:04:50.910 --> 03:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
that through those records that there's
 
03:04:54.910 --> 03:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
more money here than than should be
 
03:04:59.389 --> 03:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
there from um from legitimate means
 
03:05:01.429 --> 03:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
right so I mean obviously the easiest
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
way is if um they're recording drug buys
 
03:05:07.190 --> 03:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
they did drug buys all that sort of
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
stuff but even absent that um through
 
03:05:14.070 --> 03:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
normal criminal procedures you can and
 
03:05:16.510 --> 03:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
um you can investigate right and you can
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
you can get records and and show things
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
that way and I'm going to just followup
 
03:05:24.790 --> 03:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
and what would the threshold be I mean
 
03:05:26.990 --> 03:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the to to convict someone of the
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
drug dealing crime has to be Beyond A
 
03:05:30.750 --> 03:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt what would the
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
threshold be to prove that the drugs
 
03:05:34.910 --> 03:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
were in fact related to the to the to
 
03:05:37.550 --> 03:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
the yeah this about Cas yeah the cash
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
were was related to the underlying
 
03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
offense same thing so the police would
 
03:05:44.710 --> 03:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
have to prove Beyond reasonable doubt
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
that that money that they seized at the
 
03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
same time as They seized the drugs was
 
03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
in fact ill gotten through the drug
 
03:05:54.550 --> 03:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
trade I think that's true thank you any
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
new I'll get used to the m in a minute
 
03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
here my understanding as I read this and
 
03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
I want to sit but I'd like you to let me
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
know if I'm correct or not it says that
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
these monies that are connected to a
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
phel felonius violation of of this
 
03:06:35.830 --> 03:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
chapter so does that raise the bar of
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's required to
 
03:06:44.950 --> 03:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
above, is that I think that's would sure
 
03:06:49.550 --> 03:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
though I'm I'm sorry but I don't
 
03:06:53.429 --> 03:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
see see in
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
line it's the current law not the part
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's signed out current law oh I see I
 
03:06:59.790 --> 03:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
heard saying control drug and fonus
 
03:07:01.469 --> 03:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
violation of this chapter and all
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
proceeds yeah so thank you for the
 
03:07:06.269 --> 03:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
question representative but I I think
 
03:07:09.389 --> 03:07:09.399 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get into more detail I
 
03:07:12.389 --> 03:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
myself am not an attorney and so I I
 
03:07:14.229 --> 03:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
don't think I can answer answer that um
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
I see the word any monies at the top of
 
03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
this sentence so I think that's any
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
amount and and one other thing that I do
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
know is sometimes amounts that are
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
seized and you'll hear that next with
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
the reporting section are small
 
03:07:36.229 --> 03:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.870 --> 03:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
you no further questions uh thank you
 
03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you Mr
 
03:07:53.070 --> 03:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
McGrath Mr chairman members of the
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
03:08:00.910 --> 03:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of this very very
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
modest piece of legislation uh my name
 
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
is Lee McGrath I'm the senior
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislative Council for a public
 
03:08:10.229 --> 03:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
interest law firm called The Institute
 
03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
for for justice uh I have it is a joy to
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
be back here in conquered and talking
 
03:08:20.349 --> 03:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
about simplifying New Hampshire's uh
 
03:08:23.550 --> 03:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
processes what I'd like to do today is
 
03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:25.070 align:start position:0%
processes what I'd like to do today is
to

03:08:25.070 --> 03:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:28.389 --> 03:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
demystify some of the some of the
 
03:08:30.990 --> 03:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
Dynamics that are in play here and show
 
03:08:34.990 --> 03:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
just how simple and modest this change
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh change
 
03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
is to a legislator's question earlier
 
03:08:43.150 --> 03:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
I'll just jump to the numbers
 
03:08:46.229 --> 03:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
approximately 300 Only
 
03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year is forfeited new in New
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and goes into the drug
 
03:08:53.550 --> 03:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
forfeiture fund so we are talking about
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
a very small amount of money relative to
 
03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
the large budgets that cities like
 
03:09:03.550 --> 03:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
nashille and other New Hampshire cities
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
have for the important work of of law
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
enforcement

03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
but what the best way to think about
 
03:09:16.990 --> 03:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is to think about process and
 
03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
think about what it doesn't do what this
 
03:09:24.750 --> 03:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill does not do is change at all
 
03:09:27.790 --> 03:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
seizures seizure is the work of police
 
03:09:30.349 --> 03:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
officers and sheriffs and
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
detectives it is the taking of property
 
03:09:38.229 --> 03:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
seizure is the possession of property
 
03:09:41.070 --> 03:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
you need law enforcement needs to meet a
 
03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
very modest gold of goal but still a
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
standard of probable cause as the
 
03:09:48.990 --> 03:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
chairman as the chairman
 
03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
knows nothing in this bill deals with
 
03:09:55.229 --> 03:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
seizure doesn't change anything about
 
03:09:57.229 --> 03:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
probable cause doesn't change the work
 
03:10:01.389 --> 03:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
of police officers and sheriffs and
 
03:10:05.550 --> 03:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
detectives the next step is Criminal
 
03:10:09.309 --> 03:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
conviction nothing in this bill changes
 
03:10:12.070 --> 03:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
what happens in Criminal Court as it
 
03:10:16.190 --> 03:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
relates to to convicting a person of a
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
crime the third
 
03:10:22.269 --> 03:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
step is civil
 
03:10:26.630 --> 03:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
forfeiture and in this step this bill
 
03:10:29.229 --> 03:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
changes something
 
03:10:30.950 --> 03:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
modestly it
 
03:10:34.950 --> 03:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
changes who has the burden to prove to
 
03:10:38.950 --> 03:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
provide evidence that currency and
 
03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
instruments are related to the fruit of
 
03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
crime are the fruit fruit of crime it is
 
03:10:46.750 --> 03:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
a legitimate function of the State of
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to confiscate the fruit of
 
03:10:53.469 --> 03:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
crime in a world in which a suspect has
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
been convicted the next question is who
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
proves who has the who has the 51%
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
obligation of preponderance of the
 
03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
evidence to prove that in fact that
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
currency was the fruit of
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
crime in this narrow narrow narrow
 
03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:14.990 align:start position:0%
crime in this narrow narrow narrow
narrow

03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
question this bill changes from 49 to 51
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
to 51 to 49 it changes the burden of
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
proof from the property owner who has
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
been convicted already from the property
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
owner to the the prose prosecutor to
 
03:11:39.710 --> 03:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
prove in fact that that money was the
 
03:11:43.990 --> 03:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
fruit of of the crime
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
now how does that happen today to to
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
make it even simpler Mr chairman and I'm
 
03:11:52.030 --> 03:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
sure you your experience you you know
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
this exactly how does this happen in
 
03:11:58.790 --> 03:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
today's world the property owner must
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
produce he must produce the bank
 
03:12:03.870 --> 03:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
statements the pay
 
03:12:06.750 --> 03:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
stubs evidence that there was a
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate source of that $600 or that
 
03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:13.870 align:start position:0%
legitimate source of that $600 or that
$2,000

03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
$2,000
 
03:12:17.309 --> 03:12:17.319 align:start position:0%
in a in tomorrow's World in which you
 
03:12:22.750 --> 03:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
pass that the prosecutor has to file
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
Discovery and and get those same
 
03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
documents from the property owner
 
03:12:35.030 --> 03:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
because the prosecutor needs those
 
03:12:38.110 --> 03:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
documents needs criminal Discovery to
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
carry the new post Sylvia burden of of
 
03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
of Pro proof so in reality it's this
 
03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
this is a very you can see I hope this
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
is a very modest bill as to who does the
 
03:12:58.389 --> 03:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
work F initially in today's law the
 
03:13:01.349 --> 03:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
property owner provides the work
 
03:13:05.110 --> 03:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
initially post enactment this bill
 
03:13:08.110 --> 03:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
requires criminal
 
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
Discovery as the first
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
step in many you Mr chairman members I
 
03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
hope that's helpful and I'm happy to
 
03:13:21.630 --> 03:13:21.640 align:start position:0%
answer your questions as to the modesty
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
of this bill and how it is principally
 
03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
driven by the author's conviction of
 
03:13:33.870 --> 03:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
Burden that in our country the burden
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's on the pro whether it's on
 
03:13:38.150 --> 03:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
the defendant or on the property in
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
Civil Court the burden should be on the
 
03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:46.469 align:start position:0%
Civil Court the burden should be on the
government

03:13:46.469 --> 03:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.479 --> 03:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:13:47.590 --> 03:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:13:50.110 --> 03:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
Bert thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh Mr graph for coming up here it's
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
always a pleasure seeing you
 
03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
U I tried to look it up I can't find it
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
on Google there's a case that
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
was you know I just don't know when it
 
03:14:06.510 --> 03:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
was it could be four or five years ago
 
03:14:09.510 --> 03:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
it could be 10 years ago as time
 
03:14:12.150 --> 03:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
flies a gentleman I believe came out of
 
03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:13.590 align:start position:0%
flies a gentleman I believe came out of
Maine

03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
entered New Hampshire he had like
 
03:14:19.469 --> 03:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
$110,000 if I remember the case right
 
03:14:21.269 --> 03:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden the police pull him
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
over see the cash and They seized
 
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
it I occasionally will travel with some
 
03:14:33.309 --> 03:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
cash what would I have to do if I got
 
03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
stopped and the police saw the cash and
 
03:14:39.750 --> 03:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
seized it and said you know I don't know
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
what they would say would they have to
 
03:14:44.070 --> 03:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
say that it's drugs or or or how would I
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
ever prove where that cash came from uh
 
03:14:49.910 --> 03:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative bird this is
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
a good question because it highlights
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between what this bill
 
03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't change and what it does
 
03:15:00.229 --> 03:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
change every the hypothetical or the
 
03:15:02.870 --> 03:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
example that you that you gave is no
 
03:15:04.870 --> 03:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
different under this bill than current
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
law the police can seize that 10,000
 
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
they can seize your
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
cash in today
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow because they must have probable
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
cause a modest standard they must they
 
03:15:23.550 --> 03:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
must see that there's some residual
 
03:15:25.550 --> 03:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
drugs in the car they must there must be
 
03:15:26.950 --> 03:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
a smell of
 
03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
marijana they must have a dog that
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
triggers something that is all un
 
03:15:36.750 --> 03:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
unchanged you go to trial in New
 
03:15:38.510 --> 03:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you go to Criminal Court in
 
03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you get convicted then
 
03:15:46.110 --> 03:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
the f phase three is what happens to
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
that cash in civil court so in civil
 
03:15:54.229 --> 03:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
court this is where today you have the
 
03:15:57.150 --> 03:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
burden of showing receipts and Bank
 
03:16:00.750 --> 03:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
deposits and pay stubs and things like
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
like like that in a post syvia world the
 
03:16:10.750 --> 03:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has to initiate a criminal
 
03:16:14.189 --> 03:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
Discovery now that Discovery can re can
 
03:16:17.070 --> 03:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
include in uh interrogatories it can
 
03:16:19.189 --> 03:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
questions it can include requests for
 
03:16:22.429 --> 03:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
Doc and if you don't produce
 
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
that you have you have made the work the
 
03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
burden of the prosecutor heck of a lot
 
03:16:31.030 --> 03:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
easier he can walk into court and he can
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
say Mr Mr berd has no evidence to show
 
03:16:37.189 --> 03:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
that this was a legitimate source of
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
money and besides that we've just
 
03:16:41.710 --> 03:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
convicted him in criminal court for this
 
03:16:45.670 --> 03:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
crime of possession with the intent to
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:52.750 --> 03:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
03:16:58.590 --> 03:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
Newman have my mic
 
03:17:01.790 --> 03:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
on um I'm GL to just repeat a question
 
03:17:03.910 --> 03:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
that I had earlier for another witness
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
that I hope I'll say
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
better how does the amount CES relate to
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
the the term
 
03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
colonious Val violation as it's stated
 
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
law where it says that it must be a
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
colonious violation of this
 
03:17:31.389 --> 03:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
chapter so we're not Mr chairman
 
03:17:34.269 --> 03:17:34.279 align:start position:0%
representative Newman once again this
 
03:17:36.189 --> 03:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
seizure all the police officer all the
 
03:17:42.670 --> 03:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
def detective needs is probable probable
 
03:17:47.110 --> 03:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
cause what this has to do with is
 
03:17:51.229 --> 03:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
forfeiture after a conviction so in new
 
03:17:51.239 --> 03:17:53.349 align:start position:0%
forfeiture after a conviction so in new
New

03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the money must be
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
tied to a a conviction in a
 
03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
felony and this chapter is referring to
 
03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
a felony conviction should that
 
03:18:09.950 --> 03:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
conviction happen then this we go back
 
03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
into civil court
 
03:18:16.229 --> 03:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
and the question becomes becomes who's
 
03:18:17.590 --> 03:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
got who's got to show who's got to
 
03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
first is that helpful just follow yes um
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
that is helpful and this is the current
 
03:18:32.110 --> 03:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
law says
 
03:18:35.910 --> 03:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
that my concern is how does that relate
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
to does it make a difference between a a
 
03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
small amount like $600 or up to, doll
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
and amounts above that is there a
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
problem with that that this doesn't
 
03:18:49.550 --> 03:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
cover because of the way the current law
 
03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:50.269 align:start position:0%
cover because of the way the current law
is

03:18:50.269 --> 03:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:18:52.830 --> 03:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
written Mr chairman representative
 
03:18:56.189 --> 03:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
Newman in principle in principle this
 
03:19:01.189 --> 03:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
law treats 600 six $600 the same as it
 
03:19:01.199 --> 03:19:04.189 align:start position:0%
law treats 600 six $600 the same as it
treats

03:19:04.189 --> 03:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
600,000 dollars so there's no change in
 
03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
that now I overheard Mr Corgan talk a
 
03:19:13.070 --> 03:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
little bit about the burdens of what
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
happens when when you the the economics
 
03:19:22.030 --> 03:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
of engaging in all this process so for
 
03:19:24.590 --> 03:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
example we know that it we don't have
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
this number for New Hampshire but we
 
03:19:29.070 --> 03:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
know in Connecticut that the median
 
03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is
 
03:19:36.269 --> 03:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
$665 we know in Maine it's
 
03:19:38.910 --> 03:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
$1,700 we know in my state of Minnesota
 
03:19:38.920 --> 03:19:40.670 align:start position:0%
$1,700 we know in my state of Minnesota
it's

03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:19:44.110 --> 03:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
$57 in Nationwide it's
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
$1,300 is the median forfeit and so Mr
 
03:19:52.590 --> 03:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
corgan's testimony is not about burden
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
shifting his testimony was more about
 
03:20:00.750 --> 03:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
the pragmatic effects of all of this
 
03:20:00.760 --> 03:20:02.110 align:start position:0%
the pragmatic effects of all of this
civil

03:20:02.110 --> 03:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
civil
 
03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
litigation on relatively small amounts
 
03:20:08.750 --> 03:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
of for for
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture thank you very
 
03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:13.750 align:start position:0%
forfeiture thank you very
much

03:20:13.750 --> 03:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:20:15.429 --> 03:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
if I may I'm going to indulge myself
 
03:20:18.070 --> 03:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
with a question
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so we know when we we leave vagaries
 
03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
in the law we what we open ourselves to
 
03:20:27.710 --> 03:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
is judicial um judicial writing of a law
 
03:20:31.469 --> 03:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
if you can so by taking this
 
03:20:35.870 --> 03:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
away how I understand the burden would
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
um preponderance of the evidence
 
03:20:41.429 --> 03:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
51% H how would the state then prove for
 
03:20:43.590 --> 03:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
example that a large amount of money
 
03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
that was seized in conjunction with a
 
03:20:47.550 --> 03:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
drug forfeiture I mean a drug seizure
 
03:20:49.750 --> 03:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
case was actually uh the fruit of a
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
crime barwing um what I brought up
 
03:20:55.150 --> 03:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
earlier some some Co mingled marked
 
03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
money or something like that how would
 
03:21:00.150 --> 03:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
they meet their their burden Mr chairman
 
03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and let me
 
03:21:04.950 --> 03:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
just preference it by one small observ
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
observation that remember that the that
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
the median amount of currency for it is
 
03:21:12.479 --> 03:21:13.910 align:start position:0%
the median amount of currency for it is
is

03:21:13.910 --> 03:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:21:17.630 --> 03:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
$1,300 so now let's move to your
 
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetical the very the a common
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
concern which is a large not the 1,300
 
03:21:29.229 --> 03:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
but the 130 thou thou
 
03:21:32.990 --> 03:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
th000 the prosecutor will first have to
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
convict that person in Criminal Court he
 
03:21:39.189 --> 03:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
will do a heck of a lot of work to
 
03:21:45.070 --> 03:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:45.080 --> 03:21:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
conviction

03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
03:21:52.429 --> 03:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
then what EV did the property did the
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
convicted person produce any evidence
 
03:21:58.189 --> 03:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
that in fact there was a legitimate
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
source of this money in addition to the
 
03:22:04.269 --> 03:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
type of drug control buys that you spoke
 
03:22:07.189 --> 03:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
of and numbered bills and things things
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
like like that so in essence showing the
 
03:22:16.550 --> 03:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:18.910 --> 03:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
chairman after
 
03:22:22.030 --> 03:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
receiving Discovery the discovery qu
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
request the property owner really does
 
03:22:26.910 --> 03:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
in effect have
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
to prove a legitimate source of this
 
03:22:34.510 --> 03:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
money through the
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
discovery Pro
 
03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
process so a defendant could not simply
 
03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:42.269 align:start position:0%
process so a defendant could not simply
say

03:22:42.269 --> 03:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:22:44.590 --> 03:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
the burden's now on you state I'm not
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
answering um it's my money and that's
 
03:22:48.910 --> 03:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
all I have to say about it correct Mr
 
03:22:52.830 --> 03:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
chairman a good prosecutor would say uh
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh would ask uh show us your W2 do you
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:23:00.189 --> 03:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
W2 I'd like to introduce it into I I'm
 
03:23:02.670 --> 03:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
sure uh your defense attorney would like
 
03:23:05.189 --> 03:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
to introduce it into e EV evidence your
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
honor there's no evidence
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
here and and since we've shifted that
 
03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
burden away
 
03:23:16.349 --> 03:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
we would no longer in other words he
 
03:23:18.590 --> 03:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to just clam up and say
 
03:23:20.710 --> 03:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying anything you prove it
 
03:23:22.710 --> 03:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
now Mr
 
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
chairman all right let me take you into
 
03:23:30.830 --> 03:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
the weeds let's go okay we're in Civil
 
03:23:33.950 --> 03:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
Court taking the fifth amendment in
 
03:23:36.030 --> 03:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
civil court is different from taking the
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
fifth amendment in Criminal Court in
 
03:23:43.469 --> 03:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
France in Civil Court the tri a fact can
 
03:23:48.630 --> 03:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
infer something negative so if the if
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
the def property owner after being
 
03:23:52.269 --> 03:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
convicted in Criminal Court finds
 
03:23:55.189 --> 03:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
himself on trial in civil court and he
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
refuses to answer or even takes the
 
03:24:03.070 --> 03:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
marital privilege refuses to a answer
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
him I apologize for the weeds Mr
 
03:24:10.680 --> 03:24:12.269 align:start position:0%
him I apologize for the weeds Mr
chairman

03:24:12.269 --> 03:24:12.279 align:start position:0%

questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:24:18.269 --> 03:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I could just sure if you
 
03:24:22.189 --> 03:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
would indulge me for just just um 11
 
03:24:25.510 --> 03:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
seconds more uh my search of State
 
03:24:27.790 --> 03:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
statues reveals that New Hampshire is
 
03:24:31.469 --> 03:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
one of six other states that currently
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
has this burden on the pro property o on
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
the property owner in this in civil
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
litigation it is you are in a a minority
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
minority of
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
States dly noted thank you oh what we
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
have one more last minute question
 
03:24:50.950 --> 03:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative true thank you Mr chair
 
03:24:53.189 --> 03:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for than you my question and I
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
think I just like I I don't understand
 
03:24:58.510 --> 03:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
this is my first term in the criminal
 
03:25:02.670 --> 03:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
justice right now the burden of proof is
 
03:25:06.630 --> 03:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
on the person it
 
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
is this law will change it so that the
 
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has Discovery I'm not sure
 
03:25:15.030 --> 03:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
what Discovery is but the prosecutor
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
will now ask in Civil Court the person
 
03:25:21.429 --> 03:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
to prove his innocence and if the person
 
03:25:23.830 --> 03:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't I mean so the guy still has to
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman representative
 
03:25:32.550 --> 03:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
true despite a lack of experience in the
 
03:25:34.870 --> 03:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
criminal in this this committee you've
 
03:25:38.349 --> 03:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
nailed it th this is exactly if it ever
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
did get to
 
03:25:40.479 --> 03:25:42.710 align:start position:0%
did get to
trial

03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
trial
 
03:25:46.110 --> 03:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor would would would uh
 
03:25:48.910 --> 03:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
would examine the pro property owner the
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
person who has been convicted and he
 
03:25:55.229 --> 03:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
would say I I sent you criminal
 
03:25:58.630 --> 03:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
Discovery you have failed to respond to
 
03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
my criminal Discovery you have produced
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
no records to show that that this money
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
is uh is
 
03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate uh what evidence do you do
 
03:26:13.229 --> 03:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
now he never open ask an open-ended
 
03:26:15.790 --> 03:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
question like this but in for for today
 
03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh what evidence do you do you have to
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
show that this is a legitimate these are
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate SP so in effect at
 
03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
trial the burden is very different is is
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
very much the same as it is
 
03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
you represent thanks for taking one more
 
03:26:43.269 --> 03:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
more question I'm sorry if you already
 
03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
covered this but so what I'm starting to
 
03:26:48.189 --> 03:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
understand is that if you want to
 
03:26:48.199 --> 03:26:50.510 align:start position:0%
understand is that if you want to
demonstrate

03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
03:26:53.950 --> 03:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
um if you if you want to demonstrate
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the funds are not related to the
 
03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.830 --> 03:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
convicted but the funds are related to a
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
different crime maybe gambling or
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
something like that would you then have
 
03:27:10.920 --> 03:27:13.309 align:start position:0%
something like that would you then have
to

03:27:13.309 --> 03:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:27:16.030 --> 03:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
is that sort of like a fifth amendment
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
issue where you're being asked
 
03:27:22.110 --> 03:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
to uh where you're being asked to
 
03:27:23.830 --> 03:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
provide information that incriminates
 
03:27:27.150 --> 03:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
yourself in order to cooperate uh I
 
03:27:28.790 --> 03:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
think I I don't know that I'm phrasing
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
it correctly but I think you know what
 
03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
kind what I'm asking thank Mr chairman
 
03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bing you have posed
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
intriguing Hy hypothet hypothetical
 
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
so police sees probable cause Criminal
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
Court the person is Con convicted of
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
drugs with a with the intent to a felony
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
level drug drug crime we're now back in
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
in civil
 
03:28:01.550 --> 03:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
court and it would be wise if the person
 
03:28:03.910 --> 03:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
the the convicted person wants to try to
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
get back his his M money to show a
 
03:28:10.750 --> 03:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate source for that money and not
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
to show
 
03:28:16.510 --> 03:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
a source that is il IL
 
03:28:20.910 --> 03:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
illegal and and if the uh if the
 
03:28:23.469 --> 03:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
prosecutor would uh if if the prosecutor
 
03:28:25.349 --> 03:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
would say didn't this money come from
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
illegal gambling the colonel defense
 
03:28:30.670 --> 03:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer would object to that question
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
because it is not relevant to the qu to
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of were the proceeds
 
03:28:39.710 --> 03:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
associated with the drug crime for which
 
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
the person was con convicted now the
 
03:28:47.550 --> 03:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:49.630 --> 03:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
03:28:51.870 --> 03:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
L uh thank you sir for taking my
 
03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair just a
 
03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
simple question do you think that the UN
 
03:28:59.349 --> 03:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
a conviction of an underlying crime has
 
03:29:01.990 --> 03:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
any bearing on where burden of proof
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
would lie in other words I guess in a
 
03:29:06.269 --> 03:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
hypothetical conviction of a you know my
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
my mind a conviction of a drug crime the
 
03:29:11.630 --> 03:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
underlining intent to sell um
 
03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
would put the burden of proof on the
 
03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
defendant to say this is legal we've
 
03:29:17.550 --> 03:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
already proved by Beyond a reasonable
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
doubt that you were engaged in uh in
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
drug trafficking um and on a no charge
 
03:29:26.469 --> 03:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
or innocent verdict the burden appr
 
03:29:28.110 --> 03:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
proof should shift over to the state to
 
03:29:29.950 --> 03:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
prove why they should somehow keep this
 
03:29:29.960 --> 03:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
prove why they should somehow keep this
money

03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:29:34.670 --> 03:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
anyway Mr chair chairman Representative
 
03:29:38.670 --> 03:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
no I I I stand with representative
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh Sylvia that the state
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
should always have the burden of proof
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
it should have the burden of proof in
 
03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:47.150 align:start position:0%
it should have the burden of proof in
the

03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution it should have the
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
burden of proof in the Civil prosecution
 
03:29:56.349 --> 03:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
now to your The Twist at the end of your
 
03:29:59.309 --> 03:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
your question in New
 
03:30:03.790 --> 03:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the criminal conviction is a
 
03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
prerequisite to the Civil for for
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
forfeiture it's an expensive
 
03:30:13.469 --> 03:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
prerequisite because it requires going
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
into civil civil court it could be
 
03:30:19.189 --> 03:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
handled all to get at the same process
 
03:30:21.630 --> 03:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
as Maine now does
 
03:30:21.640 --> 03:30:23.189 align:start position:0%
as Maine now does
but

03:30:23.189 --> 03:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
but in New
 
03:30:30.309 --> 03:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the a person must be convicted
 
03:30:33.630 --> 03:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
in Criminal Court should he be
 
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
acquitted to Chairman ais's question
 
03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
earlier the money automatically returns
 
03:30:43.830 --> 03:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:43.840 --> 03:30:47.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:30:47.309 --> 03:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:50.110 --> 03:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
cther thank you for taking my question
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so what you just said that if a
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
person is found not guilty they
 
03:30:57.830 --> 03:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
automatically get the money Mr chairman
 
03:31:00.189 --> 03:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
representative gandler yes get it back
 
03:31:02.830 --> 03:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
because it is not the fruit of a crime
 
03:31:05.950 --> 03:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
for which the person has been
 
03:31:10.349 --> 03:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
convicted the legitimacy of this is to
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
confiscate the fruit of crime it is
 
03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
legitimate for New Hampshire to
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
confiscate the crime should not
 
03:31:21.790 --> 03:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
pay if a person is acquitted there's no
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
crime all this all the property should
 
03:31:24.319 --> 03:31:25.830 align:start position:0%
crime all this all the property should
be

03:31:25.830 --> 03:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:31:31.830 --> 03:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
returned follow up okay so found not
 
03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
guilty um do they still have to go into
 
03:31:34.399 --> 03:31:35.590 align:start position:0%
guilty um do they still have to go into
silver

03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
silver
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
Court in order to get that
 
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
money Mr chairman rep representative
 
03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
this is a very important
 
03:31:47.710 --> 03:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
question in that there is the
 
03:31:49.550 --> 03:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
possibility there there are not enough
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
cases in New Hampshire to see if this is
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
a problem it is a problem in other
 
03:31:57.510 --> 03:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
states in my state of Minnesota it is a
 
03:31:57.520 --> 03:31:59.950 align:start position:0%
states in my state of Minnesota it is a
94%

03:31:59.950 --> 03:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
94%
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
problem the problem in
 
03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
Minnesota is that I can be acquitted in
 
03:32:07.600 --> 03:32:08.830 align:start position:0%
Minnesota is that I can be acquitted in
criminal

03:32:08.830 --> 03:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
03:32:11.950 --> 03:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
court but if I don't engage in this
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
third trunch this civil litigation if I
 
03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
don't answer the Civil complaint if I
 
03:32:20.429 --> 03:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
don't show up in civil Civil Court I may
 
03:32:23.349 --> 03:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
have defaulted in civil
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
court and so the benefit of a conviction
 
03:32:30.990 --> 03:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
prerequisite does not acue to
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
motans because so many of them just walk
 
03:32:36.229 --> 03:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
away from their property and don't
 
03:32:39.389 --> 03:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
engage in civil civil
 
03:32:43.269 --> 03:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
court we just don't know enough about
 
03:32:46.750 --> 03:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
how this process is playing out in part
 
03:32:49.030 --> 03:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
to I think it was representative Bin's
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
question in part one of the reasons we
 
03:32:51.120 --> 03:32:52.309 align:start position:0%
question in part one of the reasons we
don't

03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
know is because this is such a
 
03:33:01.750 --> 03:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
small dollar the small issues that it is
 
03:33:04.150 --> 03:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
irrational for every party to litigate
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
all the way through to civil court and
 
03:33:07.600 --> 03:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
all the way through to civil court and
civil

03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
civil
 
03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:12.309 align:start position:0%
civil
forfeiture

03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
representative Newman did you have a
 
03:33:15.439 --> 03:33:17.389 align:start position:0%
representative Newman did you have a
question

03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna go ahead one last question
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
for myself um where you've seen this law
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
changed um similarly to this have you
 
03:33:29.710 --> 03:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
seen any um Federal implications in
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
other words I I I foresee IRS
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
involvement in unclaimed taxes from um
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
money that was
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
returned Mi M Mr chairman
 
03:33:45.389 --> 03:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh I have not seen any change in the way
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
government uh the the federal government
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
engages in its
 
03:34:00.910 --> 03:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
work on forfeiture I think the next bill
 
03:34:03.550 --> 03:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
is no that was in
 
03:34:06.150 --> 03:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
judiciary there is another bill that
 
03:34:09.710 --> 03:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia has has advanced
 
03:34:13.710 --> 03:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
that deals with with the issue of New
 
03:34:13.720 --> 03:34:15.630 align:start position:0%
that deals with with the issue of New
Hampshire's

03:34:15.630 --> 03:34:15.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
03:34:20.670 --> 03:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction versus Federal Drug jur
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and the connections between
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
the the the the two uh the treasury
 
03:34:30.550 --> 03:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
Department is involved in some federal
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
forfeitures mostly it is the
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
DEA and the department US Department of
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%

members outside what representative
 
03:34:48.750 --> 03:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
Sylvia's other Bill does that draws
 
03:34:51.349 --> 03:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
protects New Hampshire's sovereignty
 
03:34:55.189 --> 03:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
more as it relates to interact
 
03:34:58.110 --> 03:34:58.120 align:start position:0%

03:34:59.389 --> 03:34:59.399 align:start position:0%

03:35:06.910 --> 03:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
Conley there is a representative com I
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
got a little confused there uh thank you
 
03:35:28.030 --> 03:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee for
 
03:35:29.469 --> 03:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
holding this hearing today just for the
 
03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ross Connelly I'm the
 
03:35:33.389 --> 03:35:33.399 align:start position:0%
deputy state director for Americans for
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and I'm here to voice our
 
03:35:39.269 --> 03:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
support for HB 1296 I'll try to be brief
 
03:35:42.870 --> 03:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
just uh attorney m grath covered a large
 
03:35:45.150 --> 03:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
amount of your questions so just want to
 
03:35:47.070 --> 03:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
give our top line of of why we support
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
this bill it simply corrects uh language
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
in our drug forfeiture statutes to
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
ensure the burden of proof is on the
 
03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
state and not the defendant uh
 
03:35:59.229 --> 03:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
foundational principle in our legal
 
03:36:01.469 --> 03:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
system is innocent until proven guilty
 
03:36:03.510 --> 03:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
the state should have to prove the guilt
 
03:36:06.030 --> 03:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
of the defendant uh as the law currently
 
03:36:07.870 --> 03:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
stands an individual who is suspected of
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
a drug level felony drug level crime uh
 
03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
would have to prove to the state that
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
those assets were uh were innocent of
 
03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
that that crime and and we believe it
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
should be the other way around the state
 
03:36:22.750 --> 03:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
should have to prove the guilt of those
 
03:36:25.950 --> 03:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
those assets um and just to be really
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
clear because there was a lot of
 
03:36:29.550 --> 03:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
questions about this from previous
 
03:36:32.110 --> 03:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
speakers this this bill does not change
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
the way policing is done in New
 
03:36:36.030 --> 03:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whatsoever police can go and
 
03:36:38.910 --> 03:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
seize seize assets at their discretion
 
03:36:41.790 --> 03:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
using profitable cause uh this has to
 
03:36:43.469 --> 03:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
deal with putting the burden on the
 
03:36:46.269 --> 03:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
prosecutors or County attorneys uh in
 
03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
order to Forfeit that property uh to the
 
03:36:51.910 --> 03:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
state's possession uh so this small
 
03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
change as attorney McGrath
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned is is is just a small
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
correction to make sure that we're
 
03:36:59.990 --> 03:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
protecting property rights in due
 
03:37:02.590 --> 03:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
process uh and and for these reasons we
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
encourag the committee to to move this
 
03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass and I'd be happy to
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
take any
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I appreciate that
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
you refer to it as a small
 
03:37:22.269 --> 03:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
correction um and I'm curious if you
 
03:37:24.189 --> 03:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
have any commentary
 
03:37:26.670 --> 03:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
on I mean you look young so maybe you
 
03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
weren't there when they uh set this up
 
03:37:32.269 --> 03:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
in the first place but um would you
 
03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
happen to know anything about the
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
reasoning that went into establishing
 
03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
the law as is um because a small
 
03:37:42.670 --> 03:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
correction but years
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
later makes me
 
03:37:47.309 --> 03:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
wonder what the thinking was at the time
 
03:37:49.150 --> 03:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
and why things went on for so long
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
without any any changes thank you thank
 
03:37:55.630 --> 03:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative uh I
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
I am young and maybe not as young as you
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
think but I I uh I I was not there when
 
03:38:06.990 --> 03:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
this was originally done but I I can uh
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
imagine that this would uh decrease
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
workload for for obvious reasons if the
 
03:38:14.790 --> 03:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
burden of proof is on the defendant the
 
03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
the the burden of all the work is on the
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
defendant uh so it it would obviously uh
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
make things easier on on county
 
03:38:24.269 --> 03:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
attorney's offices but that's just
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
speculation uh we can just say that the
 
03:38:30.670 --> 03:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
the impact of of this bill is is a real
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
distrust in in the criminal justice
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
system the the Civil civil asset
 
03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
forfeiture in general and asset
 
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
forfeiture uh are are one of the
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
if you ask you know look at polls ugab
 
03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
has done polls on this that that show
 
03:38:49.150 --> 03:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
that an enormous majority of the country
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
disagrees with civil asset forfeiture
 
03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
and and and this ties in with that where
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh the state must have to prove the
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
guilt of of an asset just as they have
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:08.750 --> 03:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
defendant representative Klein Knight
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chair
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
um I asked this of the previous one of
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
the previous Witnesses um do you think
 
03:39:20.670 --> 03:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
that the use of body cams would solve
 
03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:22.030 align:start position:0%
that the use of body cams would solve
this

03:39:22.030 --> 03:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
issue thank you for the question
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't know if it
 
03:39:27.710 --> 03:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
would solve this issue I I think this
 
03:39:29.269 --> 03:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
bill would probably go a long way
 
03:39:31.870 --> 03:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
towards towards correcting uh this this
 
03:39:35.870 --> 03:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
issue uh we did at AFP we supported the
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
the uh bill from last year the leak
 
03:39:40.389 --> 03:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
commission that that did give funding
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
towards body warn cameras we we think
 
03:39:45.389 --> 03:39:45.399 align:start position:0%
that's an important tool to to hold law
 
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement accountable uh but but we
 
03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
think this this little correction of a
 
03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
couple sentences in the law would go a
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
long way towards shifting that burden
 
03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
issue there being no further questions
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:40:06.030 --> 03:40:06.040 align:start position:0%

Representatives thank you I'm Bill
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
Wright I'm the sheriff of belnap County
 
03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
I've been a law enforcement officer here
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire for over
 
03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:24.510 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire for over
24

03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
24
 
03:40:28.349 --> 03:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
years uh I'm in my first term as Sheriff
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
previous to this uh I was the bellnap
 
03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
County drug task force Commander I ran a
 
03:40:36.429 --> 03:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
a regional drug task force uh throughout
 
03:40:39.030 --> 03:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
Bap County I'm going to keep this short
 
03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
because I know that uh the Lieutenant
 
03:40:42.189 --> 03:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
from NASA had covered a lot of the
 
03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
points but there's a few things that I
 
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
heard during testimony here that I think
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh you need to hear it from somebody
 
03:40:50.469 --> 03:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
who's done a regional task force and has
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
been uh boots on the ground when it
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
comes to uh drug trade first and
 
03:40:58.189 --> 03:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
foremost the funds that we're seizing
 
03:41:00.510 --> 03:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
from these people they're actually drug
 
03:41:02.469 --> 03:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
dealers they're people who are actually
 
03:41:05.229 --> 03:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
dealing drugs these are not uh you know
 
03:41:07.269 --> 03:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
there was questions about somebody
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
coming across the the Border in Maine uh
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
to Hampshire and and money being seized
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
well sorry but there's got to be a Nexus
 
03:41:16.950 --> 03:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the drug trade that is part of that
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that comes in with uh it has to be
 
03:41:21.630 --> 03:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
combined facts and circumstances that
 
03:41:24.750 --> 03:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
lead us to believe that so uh the next
 
03:41:26.550 --> 03:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
thing is uh when it comes to search
 
03:41:28.510 --> 03:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
warrants I don't want you to be misled
 
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
that every seizure is based on a search
 
03:41:33.070 --> 03:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
warrant because that is not true we
 
03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
seize money uh when it comes to drug uh
 
03:41:38.750 --> 03:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
sales distribution
 
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
trafficking um
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
in in any other form of of drug sales
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
related uh investigations by uh contexts
 
03:41:51.469 --> 03:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
that we have uh consent searches um car
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
stops that uh that are that we see
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
things in plain view again it's based on
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
the facts and circumstances that lead us
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
to believe that these uh proceeds are
 
03:42:04.990 --> 03:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
connected to drug sales distribution uh
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing trafficking so on and so
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
forth as listed in the
 
03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:11.070 align:start position:0%
forth as listed in the
law

03:42:11.070 --> 03:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof as it relates to um
 
03:42:16.590 --> 03:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
any of these cases whether it be a civil
 
03:42:19.110 --> 03:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
forfeiture or conviction on a criminal
 
03:42:21.870 --> 03:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
case is the burden of the state so
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
whether it's preponderance of evidence
 
03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
or Beyond Reasonable Doubt the burden is
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
is based on the state so we do have to
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
prove and there are processes in place
 
03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
now on open source which Google or
 
03:42:36.870 --> 03:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
whatever platform that you use you can
 
03:42:38.750 --> 03:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
look up the the New Hampshire AG's drug
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
task uh the New Hampshire
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
AG's uh drug forfeiture and asset uh
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
processes so there are processes that we
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
are required to do as law enforcement in
 
03:42:52.830 --> 03:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
order to seize funds or property as it
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
relates to drug uh related
 
03:42:59.149 --> 03:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
offenses the burden of proof again
 
03:43:00.870 --> 03:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence as it relates
 
03:43:03.389 --> 03:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
to a civil case or civil
 
03:43:05.590 --> 03:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
forfeitures there is a process there if
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
I sees money based on a drug
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
investigation and I believe that it has
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
to do with with these uh types of cases
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
where it's drug sales drug
 
03:43:19.149 --> 03:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing I in return uh have to do
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
a process so I have to give a s-day
 
03:43:23.149 --> 03:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
letter to the to the uh defendant and
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
let them know that this is my
 
03:43:27.349 --> 03:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
intent the burden is on them to file
 
03:43:28.830 --> 03:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
then the paperwork to say that they want
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
to contest that and that's where we
 
03:43:33.269 --> 03:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
start the process for a hearing for a
 
03:43:36.590 --> 03:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
show s uh show of funds
 
03:43:38.670 --> 03:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
sources then the burden is on them to
 
03:43:40.950 --> 03:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
bring in a pay upub or whatever they
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
want to say is that's their money and
 
03:43:45.750 --> 03:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
again in today's technology world uh
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
that a few things that um that also were
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
stated We There was talk about
 
03:43:59.429 --> 03:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
convictions and process and all that
 
03:44:02.349 --> 03:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
there are times where we seize funds
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
from a person we seize drugs from people
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
and we know it's in relations to a a
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
drug sales case not all cases are before
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
the courts and some of those reasons are
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
because maybe somebody became a
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative source for a larger uh
 
03:44:18.750 --> 03:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
investigation that's for the betterment
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
of the community and they never get
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
charged or convicted of the original
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
offense that we were uh targeting them
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
for but the proceeds that were uh taken
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
from them during these investigations
 
03:44:32.830 --> 03:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes substantial in bnap County
 
03:44:35.790 --> 03:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
we've had several cases over $10,000 in
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
cash for people who have not had a job
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
in several years so that money is then
 
03:44:44.910 --> 03:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
we go through the Civil process and that
 
03:44:46.910 --> 03:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
money is forfeited to the
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
state which depending on um well on at
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
our state here 45% goes to the local uh
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
entity that did the investigation 45% to
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and 10% to
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
so that money is is divided
 
03:45:09.309 --> 03:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
up the burden of proof would be on that
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
that person to come in and show the
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
source of funds and that's a very small
 
03:45:15.229 --> 03:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
burden because I already had to show the
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
burden of why we were taking it in the
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
first place and we do that through
 
03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
reports and and through testimony when
 
03:45:24.790 --> 03:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:28.710 --> 03:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
process striking out this language um if
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
you have a drug dealer that has their
 
03:45:33.070 --> 03:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
drugs located in one location and then
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
the proceeds are uh in an out building
 
03:45:37.149 --> 03:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
or or perhaps hidden somewhere else
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
within the house that could be a problem
 
03:45:43.269 --> 03:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh for us to be able to connect it to
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
because now it's saying it's not with
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
the drugs it's not drug money well that
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
we find is untrue and and based on uh
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
training and experience we can tell you
 
03:45:53.229 --> 03:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
that it's hidden all over the place
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get there the drugs are in
 
03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
the safe and the money is just strewn
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
all over uh the house um I have several
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
photographs on my phone if you really
 
03:46:04.269 --> 03:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
want to see them so again when we start
 
03:46:06.189 --> 03:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
looking at the Civil forfeiture part of
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
it we don't just take money and then
 
03:46:09.469 --> 03:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
they don't get it back unless they prove
 
03:46:09.479 --> 03:46:10.189 align:start position:0%
they don't get it back unless they prove
it

03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:46:12.550 --> 03:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's there are processes in place and
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
and it's up to them to do this and I
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
don't know where the numbers come up um
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
for uh there was a gentleman that
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
testified earlier about uh $300,000 in
 
03:46:23.870 --> 03:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire what have you
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know where those uh
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
seizures I don't know where that uh
 
03:46:29.309 --> 03:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
Source comes up with where police
 
03:46:31.510 --> 03:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
operate based on evidence uh where
 
03:46:33.630 --> 03:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
evidence and facts type people so I
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't know where that comes from but if
 
03:46:38.670 --> 03:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's if it's such insignificant money as
 
03:46:40.110 --> 03:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
stated previously
 
03:46:41.469 --> 03:46:41.479 align:start position:0%
then why is it a problem with the way
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing it and the
 
03:46:44.070 --> 03:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
processes that we've been following with
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire AG's uh
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.389 --> 03:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
Bert thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my uh question could you
 
03:46:59.680 --> 03:47:02.590 align:start position:0%
for taking my uh question could you
explain

03:47:02.590 --> 03:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
explain
 
03:47:02.600 --> 03:47:04.910 align:start position:0%
explain
why

03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:47:09.309 --> 03:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
AFP Mr graph's group in 45 other states
 
03:47:12.510 --> 03:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
are are wrong for bringing this bill
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
forward I cannot tell you why they're
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
wrong I can tell you why it works here
 
03:47:19.030 --> 03:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so we we you cannot
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
compare uh even police you cannot
 
03:47:22.910 --> 03:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
compare how we police here in our state
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
to any other state so we're very unique
 
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
to what we do and uh we do give money
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
back I don't know what other states do I
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't I don't police in other states and
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
um I I honestly can't can't answer that
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
followup follow up thank you Mr Mr
 
03:47:42.189 --> 03:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you again for taking
 
03:47:42.199 --> 03:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you again for taking
my

03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.550 --> 03:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
followup if my understanding is correct
 
03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
that you all you do go through a
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
process to keep that
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
money so if that's the
 
03:48:00.910 --> 03:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
case why would this bill hurt that
 
03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
process that's already in place well as
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
stated previously during testimony uh
 
03:48:07.510 --> 03:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
why don't the police just go and and ask
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
for the W2s or why don't the police ask
 
03:48:12.269 --> 03:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
for you know um bank statements and all
 
03:48:14.670 --> 03:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
that so if a person can simply say no we
 
03:48:16.149 --> 03:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
do not want to infringe on their right
 
03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
to to say no the problem is is that when
 
03:48:21.149 --> 03:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
you start looking at getting a search
 
03:48:23.349 --> 03:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
warrant uh you're building that based on
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
probable cause to say that that specific
 
03:48:28.149 --> 03:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
dollar bill that we found in this stack
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
of money that was found during a drug
 
03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
raid was in fact uh money that was used
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
during a drug transaction for for this
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
specific thing I don't think that we
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
could we could go with a search warrant
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
and actually physically say that that
 
03:48:45.870 --> 03:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
specific $1 bill was specifically used
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
to purchase or manufacture or traffic
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
drugs within that but as a totality that
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
money was used in totality to do that
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
type of activity so a search warrant is
 
03:48:58.479 --> 03:49:00.830 align:start position:0%
type of activity so a search warrant is
very

03:49:00.830 --> 03:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.389 --> 03:49:03.399 align:start position:0%
specific thank
 
03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you chair uh thank you
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
officer for taking my question um has uh
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
this process at all have have has
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
anything significantly changed in the
 
03:49:23.710 --> 03:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
last 20 years um from doing drug
 
03:49:27.710 --> 03:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
forfeitures yes so um so a lot of County
 
03:49:29.189 --> 03:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys no longer want to go through
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
the criminal process as to um utilizing
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
the seizure money that we seize during a
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
during a vent and use that as part of uh
 
03:49:41.870 --> 03:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
negotiated plea agreement um because
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's been questioned as to whether or
 
03:49:48.349 --> 03:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
not that could have been a uh a a payout
 
03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
or payoff uh to either reduce um a
 
03:49:54.189 --> 03:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
charge or or it just gives the
 
03:49:56.670 --> 03:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
impression that it's it's not there so
 
03:50:00.670 --> 03:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
so as it relates to that we are not uh
 
03:50:02.110 --> 03:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
going that route because there is a
 
03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
separate process for the Civil civil
 
03:50:04.120 --> 03:50:05.990 align:start position:0%
separate process for the Civil civil
portion

03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
portion
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
followup yes just one okay thank well
 
03:50:11.790 --> 03:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
with that being said and you said to go
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
online and look at the uh attorney
 
03:50:17.070 --> 03:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
general's asset forfeiture materials
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
2007 yes that's the one that's online
 
03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's the practice that we still
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
do so between that time there there
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
there had to have been enough
 
03:50:33.750 --> 03:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to challenge our
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
processes between then and
 
03:50:39.469 --> 03:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
now representative years that that
 
03:50:40.830 --> 03:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
question would be more appropriate to
 
03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
the attorney general I think who manages
 
03:50:46.030 --> 03:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
that page and not the sheriff um any any
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
sheriff thank you for your time thank
 
03:50:51.239 --> 03:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
sheriff thank you for your time thank
you

03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:58.149 --> 03:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:00.510 --> 03:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
right okay there being no further
 
03:51:02.149 --> 03:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
Witnesses I'm going to go ahead and
 
03:51:04.469 --> 03:51:04.479 align:start position:0%

03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay at this time we now open the public
 
03:51:43.990 --> 03:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:46.510 --> 03:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
1493 I apologize to the representative

from uh The Institute for justice uh
 
03:52:21.269 --> 03:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
taken from
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
their uh report in
 
03:52:27.269 --> 03:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
Minnesota which shows a sample of the
 
03:52:30.510 --> 03:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
sort of uh data they collect related to
 
03:52:30.520 --> 03:52:34.910 align:start position:0%
sort of uh data they collect related to
this

03:52:34.910 --> 03:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
bill um so I'm uh pleased to introduce
 
03:52:40.349 --> 03:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
today HP
 
03:52:43.550 --> 03:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
1493 a bill which will clarify reporting
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
duties of the Department of Justice as
 
03:52:47.830 --> 03:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
it relates to seizures and
 
03:52:50.149 --> 03:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
forfeitures over the years the
 
03:52:52.349 --> 03:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has sought to assure that
 
03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
our citizens are protected from unjust
 
03:52:54.399 --> 03:52:55.590 align:start position:0%
our citizens are protected from unjust
property

03:52:55.590 --> 03:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
deprivation one of the keys to
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
understanding whether or not there might
 
03:53:02.670 --> 03:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
be a problem was found to be a lack of
 
03:53:05.510 --> 03:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
reporting data which is collected by the
 
03:53:07.710 --> 03:53:07.720 align:start position:0%
department and made available in a
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
report will serve as a useful metric in
 
03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
assuring our citizens of being being
 
03:53:13.279 --> 03:53:14.590 align:start position:0%
assuring our citizens of being being
treated

03:53:14.590 --> 03:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
treated
 
03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
fairly in
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
2018 SB 498 was passed by the
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and signed by the governor
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the reporting which was
 
03:53:28.189 --> 03:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
required has not been
 
03:53:31.030 --> 03:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
provided this bill seeks to address
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
possible barriers in providing much
 
03:53:36.790 --> 03:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
needed data with minimal burden on the
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
department as it stands now there there
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
are two reporting
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
requirements this bill consolidates
 
03:53:47.950 --> 03:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
reporting under RSA 617 col12 and
 
03:53:54.429 --> 03:53:54.439 align:start position:0%
repeals the report under RSA 318b colon
 
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
17f I hope this bill will be accepted as
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
an important measure bringing
 
03:54:00.790 --> 03:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
transparency to seizure and forfeiture
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
data i' be happy to answer any questions
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
me

03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:11.040 --> 03:54:13.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:54:13.469 --> 03:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:15.630 --> 03:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
pantelakis thank you for taking my
 
03:54:18.269 --> 03:54:18.279 align:start position:0%
question but I would like to know what
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
the comparison is of from Minnesota to
 
03:54:23.159 --> 03:54:24.429 align:start position:0%
the comparison is of from Minnesota to
New

03:54:24.429 --> 03:54:24.439 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is a great question uh so
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
for years under
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
318b the reporting requirement was
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
related to the drug a asset forfeiture
 
03:54:43.269 --> 03:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
fund and that was an annual or biannual
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
report uh which really just listed the
 
03:54:51.790 --> 03:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh amount of the fund its balance and
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
how much was uh put out in Grants it was
 
03:54:56.189 --> 03:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
minimal um and didn't provide any
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
information on specific
 
03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
forfeitures um if one requested from the
 
03:55:09.429 --> 03:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
Department you could get a report that
 
03:55:13.389 --> 03:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
um listed uh forfeitures after they were
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
all complete so going through the
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
process and going through court and and
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
finally made official and that would
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
list uh perhaps cars or money that were
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
uh forfeited and what department would
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
03:55:32.990 --> 03:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
for received that uh forfeiture fund so
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
the the information that we were getting
 
03:55:39.189 --> 03:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
was very minimal and doesn't really help
 
03:55:44.510 --> 03:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
us um see what kind of uh issues U might
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
be things that need to be addressed in
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
in understanding uh the the scope of the
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
the forfeitures and
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
seizures second
 
03:55:59.469 --> 03:55:59.479 align:start position:0%
question could you tell me if the there
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
was funding to the AG's office to do
 
03:56:02.960 --> 03:56:04.670 align:start position:0%
was funding to the AG's office to do
this

03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
reporting so the the data is
 
03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh assembled uh already as I understand
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
it so the the information is available
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of putting together
 
03:56:16.479 --> 03:56:17.269 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of putting together
the

03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:56:20.830 --> 03:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
report and uh I'm I'm sure Mr mcgraph
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
would be uh able to provide the
 
03:56:26.070 --> 03:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
information related to some of the other
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
states and what kind of process they go
 
03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
through and and have some better ideas
 
03:56:33.550 --> 03:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
of of what's involved but uh most of
 
03:56:35.070 --> 03:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
this information is available it's just
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
a matter of assembling
 
03:56:41.149 --> 03:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
it the reason I asked that question is
 
03:56:44.950 --> 03:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we often tell the AG's office of
 
03:56:48.189 --> 03:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
any Department in this New Hampshire
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
that we want things done but we don't
 
03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
give them the funding for it so I was
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
wondering if this if you knew if this
 
03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
was specially
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
funded it is not specially funded and we
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
did not get a fiscal note on this bill
 
03:57:05.910 --> 03:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
so um I don't I don't know if if that is
 
03:57:08.189 --> 03:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
problem I suppose the AG's office would
 
03:57:10.910 --> 03:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
drop by and let us know about that if if
 
03:57:12.750 --> 03:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
that is an issue that they're concerned
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative see no
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
further hands
 
03:57:22.159 --> 03:57:34.309 align:start position:0%
further hands
raised

03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
you is it repres uh the next witness
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:46.950 --> 03:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
Mr for the record my name is Dennis
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
Corgan I'm a resident of New Hampshire
 
03:57:52.110 --> 03:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
and I've uh worked with some of the
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um in the room here today for
 
03:57:58.030 --> 03:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
several years on asset forfeiture bills
 
03:58:01.149 --> 03:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
and and legislation and one of the key
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
things that uh has guided us is the need
 
03:58:11.309 --> 03:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
toess says good quality information
 
03:58:13.110 --> 03:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
03:58:17.950 --> 03:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
the particular seizures and and
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
um uh properties forfeited in order to
 
03:58:23.800 --> 03:58:25.469 align:start position:0%
um uh properties forfeited in order to
promulgate

03:58:25.469 --> 03:58:25.479 align:start position:0%
promulgate
 
03:58:25.479 --> 03:58:27.229 align:start position:0%
promulgate
um

03:58:27.229 --> 03:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
better uh approaches to to the
 
03:58:36.870 --> 03:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
legislation it's really a a key
 
03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
that if if uh legislator are
 
03:58:44.229 --> 03:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh don't have that information in front
 
03:58:47.349 --> 03:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
of them it may be difficult to see the
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
importance of the um of any reforms that
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
are that are
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
proposed in this uh Bill 1493 it seems
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
to me I'm not a lawyer but it seems to
 
03:59:02.110 --> 03:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
me that there are really three separate
 
03:59:04.510 --> 03:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
changes that are being proposed here the
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
one is to strike the last sentence of
 
03:59:11.910 --> 03:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
318 b 17 C Roman numeral
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
2 um and to replace it with a a new
 
03:59:16.080 --> 03:59:17.389 align:start position:0%
2 um and to replace it with a a new
section

03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
three uh it seems to me that
 
03:59:23.309 --> 03:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
there's as a Layman not a lot of
 
03:59:25.030 --> 03:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
difference between those two I'm not
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
going to talk about that change
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
similarly um to change the word shall to
 
03:59:34.429 --> 03:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
May um is perhaps a term of art for the
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
lawyers to talk about I really only want
 
03:59:38.229 --> 03:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
to concentrate in my testimony today
 
03:59:41.550 --> 03:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
about the very last element which is the
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
changing of the words from the to each
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
and from summary data to data and what
 
03:59:53.670 --> 03:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
guides these changes proposed changes is
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
the concept
 
03:59:59.790 --> 03:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
that it's desirable um for the public to
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
have access
 
04:00:02.040 --> 04:00:04.349 align:start position:0%
have access
to

04:00:04.349 --> 04:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh case level data so that for instance
 
04:00:11.070 --> 04:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
since the average can be computed as to
 
04:00:14.110 --> 04:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
what is the amount of uh of
 
04:00:19.110 --> 04:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
um it's um it's possible that the uh uh
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
data that's being presented to us now
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general does show the
 
04:00:34.189 --> 04:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
data in non summarized form that is
 
04:00:36.990 --> 04:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
particularly helpful there's um an
 
04:00:39.070 --> 04:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
argument that could be made that
 
04:00:43.710 --> 04:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh not every element in the uh prescri
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh which prescribes the form
 
04:00:50.670 --> 04:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
of the report is available in particular
 
04:00:53.070 --> 04:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
the approximate value and
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
disposition is is perhaps properly
 
04:00:59.149 --> 04:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
reported I'm not sure the type is shown
 
04:01:03.070 --> 04:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's a cash or automobile or or
 
04:01:06.510 --> 04:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
these sorts of things and these um
 
04:01:09.389 --> 04:01:09.399 align:start position:0%
details are available reporting and in
 
04:01:09.399 --> 04:01:12.070 align:start position:0%

hearing today once again for the record
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Ross Connelly I'm the deputy
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%

hb1
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
1493 uh this bill is is quite simple and
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
and modest it it it provides more trans
 
04:02:40.590 --> 04:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
transparency in the use and procurement
 
04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
of forfeitures in New Hampshire uh
 
04:02:45.309 --> 04:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
currently we have a report that uh gets
 
04:02:47.349 --> 04:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
sent to the governor executive counsel
 
04:02:50.670 --> 04:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee uh it's quite
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
unclear it's it's
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
confusing uh and it doesn't provide the
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
amount of detail that would better
 
04:02:58.590 --> 04:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
inform legislators and government
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
officials into making uh decisions uh
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
about forfeiture in New
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we often get ranked here in
 
04:03:09.630 --> 04:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as first in Freedom uh one
 
04:03:12.030 --> 04:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
of the areas that we certainly are not
 
04:03:14.189 --> 04:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
first in is is government
 
04:03:16.510 --> 04:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
transparency and and we view that this
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
bill will will certainly help to uh to
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
give more transparency and to forfeiture
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings answer a lot of these
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
questions that we've been hearing over
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
the past two bills uh and the other bill
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
in in uh Judiciary and and uh having
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
more you know un unleashing that veil of
 
04:03:38.910 --> 04:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
government and having more
 
04:03:41.229 --> 04:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
uh information to the public so that
 
04:03:42.990 --> 04:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
they can be better informed is always a
 
04:03:44.910 --> 04:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
good idea it builds trust with the the
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
public and we believe just these these
 
04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
few changes to the current statute will
 
04:03:54.030 --> 04:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
provide a a better look at at what uh is
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
happening with forfeiture in New
 
04:03:55.880 --> 04:03:58.630 align:start position:0%
happening with forfeiture in New
Hampshire

04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:04:02.149 --> 04:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh I'll be brief and just leave time to
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions since attorney
 
04:04:06.590 --> 04:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
McGrath behind me uh has a lot more of
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
the individual detail of what currently
 
04:04:10.830 --> 04:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
in the report and what changes this
 
04:04:13.870 --> 04:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
would would make but it the real message
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
is that this provides more transparency
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
and will better inform uh both the
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislature and the public in decision M
 
04:04:23.630 --> 04:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
making in the future and it should not
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
take up an enormous amount more time
 
04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
since they already have to create a
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
summary of the existing data uh in
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
current law so it would probably save
 
04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
them time if anything in the Attorney
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
04:04:40.830 --> 04:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative pakis thank you Mr
 
04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
chairman did you say that there was a
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
report that went to the governor the
 
04:04:45.560 --> 04:04:46.790 align:start position:0%
report that went to the governor the
executive

04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
Council yes so the current uh statute uh
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at at at the bill language
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it uh the Attorney General shall
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
report 60 days after the close of each
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to the governor and councel
 
04:05:02.590 --> 04:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
and to the fiscal Committee of the
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
general court a detailed accounting of
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
the grants provided law enforcement
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
agencies yada yada y they they they have
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
to provide this report to the
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
legislature governor and and executive
 
04:05:15.750 --> 04:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
counsel we just believe that the detail
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
in that report is not uh clear and and
 
04:05:22.990 --> 04:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh can be confusing to read and not
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
detailed in a way that actually gives a
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
look of what is being done correctly and
 
04:05:31.030 --> 04:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
and what might be uh be areas of
 
04:05:33.870 --> 04:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
Correction in in for forfeiture
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%

individualized line by line forfeitures
 
04:06:32.830 --> 04:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
for every type of asset that has been
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
seized so all
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
8,000 forfeitures in in Minnesota are
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
reported on a line by line line property
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
by property basis and she and she has
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%

allocation for the running of her office
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
when this when that reporting
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
requirement was implemented in 2009
 
04:07:01.030 --> 04:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
there was no incremental funding going
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
to her her office she absorbed the the
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
costs of of that in her in her budget
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
I was just asking the comparison of the
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire's very small
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.269 --> 04:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
is Mr uh Mr chairman this is not once
 
04:07:26.990 --> 04:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
again if you if you would indulge me
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a burdensome requirement and
 
04:07:33.070 --> 04:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
if I may I'd be happy to distribute I
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
have three copies of I have copies of
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
the last three reports and
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General is reporting on a
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
line by line ba
 
04:07:45.359 --> 04:07:47.309 align:start position:0%
line by line ba
basis

04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
basis
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh you may pass them around line by line
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
line basis but what this piece of
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
legislation would do would would would
 
04:08:01.469 --> 04:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
add an element to this
 
04:08:05.109 --> 04:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
reporting it would add the element of
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
the type of property and the type and
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
the value of that type of
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
property far so you can see that here in
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
the Minnesota
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
report the
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
the a 1995 Chevrolet Lumina was sold for
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:38.109 --> 04:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
one so this what this build does is
 
04:08:41.229 --> 04:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
change New Hampshire's reporting from a
 
04:08:44.189 --> 04:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
cash flow system and you will see in the
 
04:08:47.149 --> 04:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
in the in the reports that that when
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
this bill was modified in the Senate a
 
04:08:51.269 --> 04:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
few years ago from representative
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
Maguire's origin uh an original Bill and
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
turned into a a reporting bill in the in
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
the sen
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
Senate it
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
was ambiguous to the the type of element
 
04:09:11.309 --> 04:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
to be reported and the and the Attorney
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
General reasonably reasonably has
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
interpreted the statute to be a cash
 
04:09:19.710 --> 04:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
flow statement how much money seized how
 
04:09:21.950 --> 04:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
much money forfeited how much money
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
allocated along the the state's 45 by 45
 
04:09:26.080 --> 04:09:26.790 align:start position:0%
allocated along the the state's 45 by 45
by

04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:09:29.950 --> 04:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
10 for
 
04:09:33.550 --> 04:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
formula the incremental the small change
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be to convert to add an element
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
about property
 
04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
why this is why this is worthy of your
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
consideration it is worthy of your
 
04:09:46.590 --> 04:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
consideration because in states that
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
have a that report on a property basis
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
you can see just how modest the
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is in
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
currency so in Connecticut once again Mr
 
04:10:01.149 --> 04:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
CH Mr chairman the median currency
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
$665 in Maine it is $1,000
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.429 --> 04:10:18.439 align:start position:0%
$57 and Nationwide it is
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
1,300 do
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
dollars that information is vital to
 
04:10:26.910 --> 04:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
this committee and other legislators
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
because it shapes the discussions that
 
04:10:34.670 --> 04:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
were raised earlier about the cost of
 
04:10:37.469 --> 04:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
litigation in a civil system where you
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a public defender where the
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
Indigent don't have a public defender
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
secondly it
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
raises questions about law
 
04:10:49.040 --> 04:10:51.309 align:start position:0%
raises questions about law
enforcement's

04:10:51.309 --> 04:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement's
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
prioritizing there is certainly reasons
 
04:10:54.119 --> 04:10:57.710 align:start position:0%
prioritizing there is certainly reasons
to

04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
prioritize large criminal activ activity
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
that is not in dispute
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:11:09.189 align:start position:0%
that is not in dispute
here

04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:11:09.199 --> 04:11:10.590 align:start position:0%
here
Connecticut's

04:11:10.590 --> 04:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's
 
04:11:13.590 --> 04:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
665 knowing that state legislators in
 
04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
Connecticut may come to a
 
04:11:15.439 --> 04:11:17.149 align:start position:0%
Connecticut may come to a
different

04:11:17.149 --> 04:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion Mr chairman just one other
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
point to this to this mod modesty
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia resisted the
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
requests of a certain public interest
 
04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer to adopt 30 reporting elements
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
like the kind that Arizona Colorado
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
Maryland Minnesota uh uh
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
and New Jersey have adopted and so once
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
again not 30 requirements but just a
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
couple of tweaks to the reporting bill
 
04:11:50.910 --> 04:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
is the Sylvia style and I'm happy to
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
04:11:52.399 --> 04:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
about

04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you if and if I just may ask
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
a question under Roman numeral 4 it
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
adopt would a change of language from sh
 
04:12:04.870 --> 04:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
to May when in regards to ad adopting
 
04:12:07.389 --> 04:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
rules uh what is the rationale for Chang
 
04:12:12.030 --> 04:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
in that to may as opposed shall M Mr
 
04:12:13.149 --> 04:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
chairman the
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
ration is that the Attorney General may
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
not have to adopt
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
rules to to uh to meet the
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
legislature's requirements he just may
 
04:12:25.630 --> 04:12:25.640 align:start position:0%
have to just put out an Excel
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet with some instructions so
 
04:12:30.550 --> 04:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
going through the ru making Authority
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
necessary representative Pratt you Andre
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
yes I just have a quick question all day
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
we've been hear about the small amount
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
of money that's involved in these but in
 
04:12:46.149 --> 04:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
my area I'm familiar with two houses
 
04:12:48.510 --> 04:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
that were taken for drug forfeiture yes
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
sir and uh they were loaded with money
 
04:12:52.750 --> 04:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
loaded with jewels and uh diamonds and
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
they dig the backyard up and B even more
 
04:12:58.590 --> 04:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
in vehicles and motorcycles so it would
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
seem like one of those a year would
 
04:13:03.109 --> 04:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
bring this number up from $200 to $300
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
to a higher number than this and hours
 
04:13:10.269 --> 04:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead M uh Mr chairman representative
 
04:13:14.189 --> 04:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
yes there there there are the
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
anecdotal large SE seiz
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
um but the median
 
04:13:29.950 --> 04:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
seizure the median forfeiture the median
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
now remember not average me median the
 
04:13:35.469 --> 04:13:35.479 align:start position:0%
median uh forfeiture in new New
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 7,000
 
04:13:43.469 --> 04:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
th000 so so absolutely law enforcement
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
crime shouldn't pay it's legitimate for
 
04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
the state to confiscate the fruit of of
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
of crime and there will be some out
 
04:13:53.790 --> 04:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
large out
 
04:13:59.229 --> 04:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative representative clein KN
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um I have the same qu
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
similar question to chairman abis on
 
04:14:09.080 --> 04:14:10.229 align:start position:0%
similar question to chairman abis on
line

04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
14 uh changing shell to May doesn't this
 
04:14:16.910 --> 04:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
make the whole entire Bill
 
04:14:19.510 --> 04:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
irrelevant Mr chairman uh representative
 
04:14:22.189 --> 04:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I hope not I don't
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
think so I think it's just a question of
 
04:14:27.870 --> 04:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire's formal
 
04:14:29.790 --> 04:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
administrative law as it relates to
 
04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
promulgating rules is necessary for the
 
04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to meet the obligations
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
the renewed red and renewed obligations
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
that you're putting on on him and and uh
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
and so there therefore he may he may not
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
have to go through the extended
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
administrative process of rule
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
promation it does not lessen it does not
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
reduce his obligation to meet your new
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
in your data
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:16.109 align:start position:0%

criminal justice committee two terms
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
about a decade ago and always enjoyed
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
the discussions here it's good to be
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
back um I've long been a an advocate for
 
04:45:52.590 --> 04:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
fair sentencing and a transparent
 
04:45:54.430 --> 04:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system oh by the way
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
sorry Mark Warden representing
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester w 8 hillsb 15 and uh said I'm
 
04:46:04.030 --> 04:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
a advocate of Criminal Justice System
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
that respects our cultural norms while
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
also protecting individual
 
04:46:12.270 --> 04:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
liberty this proposed legislation 1232
 
04:46:14.350 --> 04:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
is similar to what this committee heard
 
04:46:19.150 --> 04:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
last year that was HB 615 in 2021 that
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
bill passed the committee and the full
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
house before dying in the
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
Senate this particular bill has been
 
04:46:26.910 --> 04:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
stripped down it's much
 
04:46:30.590 --> 04:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
simpler and right there in the um
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bill it's correct this
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
bill reduces the penalties and removes
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
proves mandatory minimum sentences for
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
certain first offense drug offenses and
 
04:46:42.990 --> 04:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
then on the method methodology SE
 
04:46:45.150 --> 04:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
methodology section it says the judicial
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
Council States this bill would reduce
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
firsttime possession Transportation or
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
use of certain controlled drugs from a
 
04:46:55.830 --> 04:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
class B felony to an unclassified
 
04:46:58.350 --> 04:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor subsequent violations
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
meaning not your first time could be
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
sentenced as either Class B felonies or
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
an unclassified misdemeanor at the
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
discretion of the
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and then I can go through the
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
sections real quick if you'd like
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
section one reduces the penalty on
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:19.958 --> 04:47:21.548 align:start position:0%
 
misdemeanor

04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
if if an offender has been convicted
 
04:47:25.628 --> 04:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
previously then the penalty is reduced
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
from Felony a to a felony b or missed
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
meanor they' still give them that
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
discretion section two the first
 
04:47:36.590 --> 04:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph removes the requirement for
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.920 --> 04:47:42.990 align:start position:0%
 
sentences

04:47:42.990 --> 04:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.990 --> 04:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
of this is regarding selling in area
 
04:47:48.990 --> 04:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
school the second paragraph relates to
 
04:47:51.430 --> 04:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
drug Enterprise leaders and removes a
 
04:47:54.030 --> 04:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
25-year mandatory minimum sentence
 
04:47:56.670 --> 04:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
leaving the sentence up to the
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
court then section three is super simple
 
04:47:59.680 --> 04:48:01.310 align:start position:0%
court then section three is super simple
it

04:48:01.310 --> 04:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
repeals um penalty for schedule five
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
controlled drugs and Accord according to
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
the dea.gov website schedule 5 drugs are
 
04:48:12.990 --> 04:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
defined as drugs with lower potential
 
04:48:15.548 --> 04:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
for abuse than schedule four and consist
 
04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
of preparations containing limited
 
04:48:21.150 --> 04:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
quantities of certain narcotics schedule
 
04:48:22.590 --> 04:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
five drugs are generally used for
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
anti-diarrheal antitussive and analgesic
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
purposes some examples are cough
 
04:48:30.070 --> 04:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
preparations with less than 200
 
04:48:32.190 --> 04:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
milligrams of Codine per thousand
 
04:48:35.788 --> 04:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
milliliters such as such as robus and AC
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
Lomotil motofen and LCA so the main goal
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
here is to reduce penalties for
 
04:48:42.990 --> 04:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
firsttime offenders with a goal of
 
04:48:45.548 --> 04:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
reducing the backlog and the Clogg
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system and the courts
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
and keeping PTY uh keeping pil people
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
who are guilty of victimless crimes from
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
potentially having their livelihood
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
ruined and opportunities denied because
 
04:48:59.230 --> 04:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
conviction this topic was brought to my
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
attention by an assistant count attorney
 
04:49:06.510 --> 04:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
in HBO County who said she was tired of
 
04:49:09.868 --> 04:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
seeing so many people's lives ruined she
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
thought that her office should have more
 
04:49:14.350 --> 04:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
discretion in prosecution she was
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in changing the
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
law to allow for possession of personal
 
04:49:20.910 --> 04:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
use levels of fenel and heroin and as
 
04:49:22.590 --> 04:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
bad as those things can be as bad as
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
those um substances can be they are P
 
04:49:27.310 --> 04:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
pervasive and running these people
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
through the criminal justice system
 
04:49:31.708 --> 04:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
often exacerbates the problem she wanted
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
the option of putting them into a
 
04:49:34.110 --> 04:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
treatment program inste instead of
 
04:49:35.548 --> 04:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
throwing the book at them but she felt
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
they they lack lacked much discretion in
 
04:49:40.430 --> 04:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
the the prosecutor's office she said
 
04:49:42.430 --> 04:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
they're just overwhelmed with so many
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
cases and while this spells in exactly
 
04:49:46.590 --> 04:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
what she's looking for it is tangential
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
and was the impetus for this proposed
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.750 --> 04:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
today with that I'm I'll be happy to
 
04:49:57.150 --> 04:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
answer questions best I can and I don't
 
04:49:58.510 --> 04:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody else justf or not
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%

did through

the definitions and that's sort of my
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the definitions in the

04:50:53.310 --> 04:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
Senate was the issues with the Senate
 
04:50:56.510 --> 04:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
addressed or is it we not supposed to
 
04:50:59.830 --> 04:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
refer to the um the the other
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
body I thought that was just on the
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
house floor it's it I believe it applies
 
04:51:07.708 --> 04:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
applies in the committee room as well
 
04:51:10.548 --> 04:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
really just I've only been here 12 years
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
I guess thank you for question I I
 
04:51:13.628 --> 04:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
really don't know the answer I'm not
 
04:51:15.390 --> 04:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
sure what happened in the the other
 
04:51:18.030 --> 04:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
place all right it wasn't my bill last
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
year I wasn't following it very closely
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:34.948 align:start position:0%

see see no hands raised I want to thank
 
04:51:40.350 --> 04:51:40.360 align:start position:0%

04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
Conley thought I had been promoted I

I'm with you um thank you Mr chair
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the last
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
time today my name is Ross Connelly I'm
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
the deputy state director for Americans
 
04:52:04.310 --> 04:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
for Prosperity here to voice our support
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
for hb1
 
04:52:08.510 --> 04:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
1232 as uh representative Warden
 
04:52:11.670 --> 04:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is a bill very closely
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
that uh similar to HB 615 which passed
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
this committee last year and and uh
 
04:52:20.350 --> 04:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice vote out of the house
 
04:52:23.708 --> 04:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
it does simplify the language where last
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
year's Bill addressed a lot of mandatory
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
maximums a lot of fines reduction of
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
fines across the criminal code this bill
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
tries to find some consensus for that
 
04:52:38.788 --> 04:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
other body um that uh where where we're
 
04:52:41.590 --> 04:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
focusing specifically on those firsttime
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
drug offenses uh we view the the current
 
04:52:49.390 --> 04:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
situation where we're we're we've kind
 
04:52:52.190 --> 04:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
of reverted back unfortunately the drug
 
04:52:54.030 --> 04:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
dependence is a pretty personal problem
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
for for many Granite Staters uh almost
 
04:52:59.070 --> 04:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
everyone has a connection to somebody
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
that has had an issue especially in in
 
04:53:04.868 --> 04:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
my generation uh with with dependence on
 
04:53:07.230 --> 04:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
drugs and over the past couple years
 
04:53:09.788 --> 04:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
we've unfortunately gone back on on that
 
04:53:12.270 --> 04:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're hitting very high uh
 
04:53:15.310 --> 04:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
overdose rates once again and uh
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the current trajectory is not
 
04:53:22.750 --> 04:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh working and and taking a new approach
 
04:53:25.948 --> 04:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
is what we believe is needed where we we
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh take firsttime drug possession
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
especially uh as a misdemeanor and and
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
try to direct those uh those addicts
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
towards getting the help they need and
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that help is not in prison it is in
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh treatment facilities so that they uh
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
especially 90-day treatment facilities
 
04:53:48.270 --> 04:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
which will help them uh get out of the
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
cycle of dependence on drugs sending
 
04:53:53.110 --> 04:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
them to prison only creates a cycle
 
04:53:55.470 --> 04:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
where uh the the famous George Jung
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
quote that he went to prison with a a
 
04:53:59.910 --> 04:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
bachelor's in marijuana he graduated
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
with a a master's in cocaine I I think
 
04:54:05.910 --> 04:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
that the solution is not in prison the
 
04:54:08.548 --> 04:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
solution is in uh treatment and getting
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
the these folks the the help they need
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
and we believe this bill does just that
 
04:54:16.990 --> 04:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
um just to answer some of the the
 
04:54:20.190 --> 04:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
previous in terms
 
04:54:25.230 --> 04:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
of uh section five uh that does apply to
 
04:54:28.270 --> 04:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
drug dealers however that just removes a
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum of of
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh that that's included currently so it
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
gives more discretion to the judge to
 
04:54:40.510 --> 04:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
make a a sentencing decision uh based on
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
on the level of crime uh we don't
 
04:54:45.070 --> 04:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
believe that one size fits all is is the
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
best approach towards uh addressing the
 
04:54:50.430 --> 04:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
criminal code so allowing that judge
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
more discretion o over that uh we
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
believe is appropriate uh and with that
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
questions r pres
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
Bert thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:55:12.030 --> 04:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we just received opposition
 
04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
paper to this
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to read just one line of
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
it and I disagree with it because I
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't think you can force anybody to do
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
anything um and I was just wondering
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
what AFP or you personally feel about
 
04:55:29.230 --> 04:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
this is it says minimum mandatory
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
sentencing so they're opposed to this
 
04:55:34.548 --> 04:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
bill minimum mandatory sentencing allow
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
slash forces people convicted to get
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
treatment I don't think you can force
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
people to get treatment can you is there
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
a question that was the question can you
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:55:50.830 --> 04:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
Representative no I I don't believe uh
 
04:55:53.390 --> 04:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
and the data does not suggest that that
 
04:55:55.948 --> 04:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
forcing individuals into treatment is is
 
04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
the best Avenue uh especially through
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
through punitive means where where
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're imprisoning them uh that that's
 
04:56:06.190 --> 04:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
not exactly the best incentive towards
 
04:56:08.430 --> 04:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh Rehabilitation and and taking the
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
approach of uh getting them the help
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
they need uh especially again especially
 
04:56:16.708 --> 04:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
for those firsttime
 
04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
run-ins uh is is the best opportunity to
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
get them out of that cycle uh so having
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
a mandatory minimum in putting every
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
single person in the same box without
 
04:56:31.150 --> 04:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
any discretion to to the level of crime
 
04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
or uh the extenuating C
 
04:56:37.708 --> 04:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh is not helping
 
04:56:40.628 --> 04:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
obviously and and uh taking this this
 
04:56:43.628 --> 04:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
different tact will help to to correct
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:56:54.670 --> 04:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
true thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question so would you say that
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
this basically is just removing the
 
04:57:02.510 --> 04:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentencing doesn't necessarily
 
04:57:04.990 --> 04:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
stop the CL of the courts with
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
cases thank you for the question
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh it would help with the
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
backlog to to representative warden's
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
point for that first section so uh
 
04:57:18.830 --> 04:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
currently there's an enormous backlog
 
04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
especially in Hillsboro County and
 
04:57:24.548 --> 04:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County for these offenses and
 
04:57:28.590 --> 04:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
and uh to the representative's point U
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
of of the Deputy County
 
04:57:33.310 --> 04:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
attorney she she stated that she she
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
sees the same people cycle in and out
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
and and they're not getting the actual
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
help they need and uh they they get sent
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
to prison they go to prison they come
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
back they relapse they and it's that
 
04:57:48.270 --> 04:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
constant cycle uh and they often turn to
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
selling as well to to help their habit
 
04:57:56.190 --> 04:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
um the that first section will
 
04:57:58.830 --> 04:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely help with the backlog uh
 
04:58:01.470 --> 04:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
because if it's not a felony be offense
 
04:58:04.190 --> 04:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
then you're it's not the same degree of
 
04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
of case load that the county attorney's
 
04:58:09.150 --> 04:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
office will have to carry uh and it will
 
04:58:12.510 --> 04:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
will direct them towards actual means of
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
help uh and uh so in terms of that that
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
second section with the mandatory
 
04:58:20.190 --> 04:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
minimum that won't necessarily help with
 
04:58:22.590 --> 04:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
backlog but it will help with with
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion and not uh you know
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
putting people who may not be deserving
 
04:58:31.110 --> 04:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
of a 25-year sentence or maybe they're
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
de deserving of much more uh that that
 
04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
will be the discretion of the
 
04:58:42.590 --> 04:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
you thank thank you for your testimony
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.040 --> 04:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
much

04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:18.590 --> 04:59:18.600 align:start position:0%

Newman was the original
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
statement was that was there before that
 
05:04:36.628 --> 05:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
should not have been excluded that the
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
Attorney General was at the original
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
statement and then you they added that
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
last line was important a little bit
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
better correct section three prior to
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
that last sentence is all identical to
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
the original Bill we just rewrote
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
section three and added that last
 
05:04:55.030 --> 05:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%

Balden sorry um just for clarification
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:03.670 align:start position:0%
Balden sorry um just for clarification
so

05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:07.030 --> 05:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the strike through
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the the the part of the bill before
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
the before where this would be inserted
 
05:05:14.350 --> 05:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
it Still Remains a strike through is
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
that right and the
 
05:05:19.390 --> 05:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
um basically is this just
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
changing the Roman 3 in the bill and
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
everything else in the bill is the same
 
05:05:26.910 --> 05:05:26.920 align:start position:0%

identical the only difference is on
 
05:05:35.948 --> 05:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
section three we're basically striking
 
05:05:37.390 --> 05:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
all of section three and replacing it
 
05:05:38.510 --> 05:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
with the new section three in the
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
amendment and the amendment the only
 
05:05:42.030 --> 05:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
difference between the what was in the
 
05:05:43.788 --> 05:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
original bill and the new one is that
 
05:05:59.910 --> 05:05:59.920 align:start position:0%

cther

05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:49.948 --> 05:09:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
note representative
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
today there was a spreadsheet of the
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
costs uh in
 
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
2020 uh of property seized this was Happ
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
to be by in Minnesota but
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
I I haven't seen anything as far as New
 
05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in in respect to a fiscal note
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
I don't believe if there's any money
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
received through forfeiture that the
 
05:10:26.910 --> 05:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
money is just thrown into a pile it is a
 
05:10:28.590 --> 05:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
I can imagine that it's accounted for
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
and entered into a system what's being
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
reported is the total amount of money
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
not an item detailed itemization so I I
 
05:10:38.948 --> 05:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
could imagine that the data entries are
 
05:10:41.470 --> 05:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
already being done what would have to be
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
part of the report would be a more
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
detailed it would be the details of
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
those data entries which is already in
 
05:10:51.430 --> 05:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
the system now whether the the software
 
05:10:54.510 --> 05:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
can do that or not I can speak to
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
that representative l so the reporting
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
requirement is already there this just
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
changes some of the mo this modifies the
 
05:11:03.150 --> 05:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
way it's done so they already the
 
05:11:04.708 --> 05:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
Attorney General already has to report
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
on the asset forfeiture fund including
 
05:11:08.150 --> 05:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
what's taken the detailed accounting of
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
what's taken this adds a an expenditure
 
05:11:12.150 --> 05:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
I think that I'm not sure is there
 
05:11:15.390 --> 05:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
before but um I again the report is
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
already required this changes a little
 
05:11:18.750 --> 05:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
bit of the format and how it's done as
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
all and the inclusion model
 
05:11:22.830 --> 05:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gther what I was
 
05:11:24.510 --> 05:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
explaining was they're already entering
 
05:11:27.548 --> 05:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
the data individually every time money
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
is received so it would be in the system
 
05:11:32.910 --> 05:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
it just what's going to be part of the

05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:15:15.070 --> 05:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
committee for your consideration I
 
05:15:19.150 --> 05:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
present um HB 1360 relative to penalties
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
for controll drug
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
violations similar to the bill we just
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
previously heard um in this
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill I tried to um address the issue of
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
making felons out of um firsttime
 
05:15:37.110 --> 05:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
offenders um for simple drug
 
05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
possession uh the difference being that
 
05:15:44.070 --> 05:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
um we changed it to a misdemeanor but we
 
05:15:47.390 --> 05:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
also kept some fine um the previous as a
 
05:15:51.510 --> 05:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
law is now is $25,000 up to and anyone
 
05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
who has no any knowledge of the court
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
system or the criminal justice system
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
realizes that those type of fine amount
 
05:16:02.470 --> 05:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
set up defendants to fail um no one can
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
afford $25,000 most people I know that
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
have jobs and are doing well cannot just
 
05:16:07.760 --> 05:16:08.948 align:start position:0%
have jobs and are doing well cannot just
afford

05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
afford
 
05:16:10.750 --> 05:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
$225,000 and the people that are
 
05:16:12.310 --> 05:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
involved in these type of offenses
 
05:16:14.430 --> 05:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
generally aren't um
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
overemployed so we reduced it to
 
05:16:21.548 --> 05:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
$5,000 uh as a maximum and that's
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
something that would still have a sting
 
05:16:24.948 --> 05:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
to it but it would not be beyond the
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
range of possibilities for someone to
 
05:16:28.110 --> 05:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
actually pay their
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
fine um the second part of it we changed
 
05:16:32.590 --> 05:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
it from a
 
05:16:35.470 --> 05:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
um we changed it from a Class A to class
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
B felony um it's still a felony it's a
 
05:16:40.160 --> 05:16:41.310 align:start position:0%
B felony um it's still a felony it's a
second

05:16:41.310 --> 05:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:16:44.430 --> 05:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
offense um and I'd still be open further
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
to amending that if the committee so
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
thought that was wise um we again
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
lowered the fine from uh
 
05:16:55.948 --> 05:16:55.958 align:start position:0%
$50,000 which again sets up a a
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
defendant for almost certain failure wor
 
05:17:00.990 --> 05:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
such a fine imposed but we did keep a
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
fine if
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um and I kept this one simple um
 
05:17:08.910 --> 05:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill we heard I I liked it
 
05:17:11.708 --> 05:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
as well but I I've with our experience
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
in the previous year with the other body
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
the more complicated bills tend to get
 
05:17:16.240 --> 05:17:16.910 align:start position:0%
the more complicated bills tend to get
the

05:17:16.910 --> 05:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:19.628 --> 05:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
more um other things get put in with
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
them and they don't recog resemble
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
anything we sent over there in the first
 
05:17:25.510 --> 05:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
place so keeping this one as simple as
 
05:17:27.868 --> 05:17:27.878 align:start position:0%
possible um I think it's a good first
 
05:17:31.548 --> 05:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
step towards um lowering our our
 
05:17:35.708 --> 05:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
incarceration rates making felons out of
 
05:17:38.190 --> 05:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh simple possession
 
05:17:41.548 --> 05:17:41.558 align:start position:0%
defendants and setting up people to fail
 
05:17:43.350 --> 05:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
with fines that they have absolutely no
 
05:17:44.270 --> 05:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
way of
 
05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
repaying and with that I'm happy to take
 
05:17:46.600 --> 05:17:52.990 align:start position:0%
repaying and with that I'm happy to take
any

05:17:52.990 --> 05:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lang you're
 
05:17:57.230 --> 05:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
recognized I I'm just questioning the
 
05:17:59.708 --> 05:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
fine amount on a misdemeanor At Last I
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
remember the maximum fine by statute on
 
05:18:05.270 --> 05:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor was a misdemeanor is
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
$1,200 and does that in in statute
 
05:18:09.788 --> 05:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
that's what we have under penalty
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
Clauses so does this change that for all
 
05:18:14.430 --> 05:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors or is this we're going to
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
call out this one misdemeanor and change
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
it to a new fine
 
05:18:21.510 --> 05:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
amount I would say that since it's
 
05:18:23.628 --> 05:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
specific to this statute it wouldn't
 
05:18:27.030 --> 05:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
impact any other any other um any other
 
05:18:27.040 --> 05:18:30.310 align:start position:0%
impact any other any other um any other
fine

05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:30.320 --> 05:18:32.430 align:start position:0%
 
amounts

05:18:32.430 --> 05:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:40.470 --> 05:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
sure representative we just heard a
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill not too long ago HB 1232 is there
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
any conflict between the two bills that
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
you're aware
 
05:18:51.590 --> 05:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
of other than the fine amounts were
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
where this bill left some fine that bill
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
did away with fines all together um that
 
05:19:00.548 --> 05:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
bill was much more expansive in the
 
05:19:02.270 --> 05:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
things that it touched
 
05:19:09.390 --> 05:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.708 --> 05:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative this time the chair now
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.910 --> 05:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
brigh good afternoon committee thank you
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony um in reference
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
to uh well for the record uh my name is
 
05:19:37.150 --> 05:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Bill BR from the New
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police um in reference
 
05:19:43.310 --> 05:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:19:47.230 --> 05:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
the the uh first offense and second
 
05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
offense charges of uh certain narcotics
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
um dangerous drugs being uh classified
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
as misdemeanors instead of uh felonies
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
just like to point out that U many of
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
these uh cases uh in today's judicial
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
system are being negotiated uh downward
 
05:20:08.910 --> 05:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
already um and changing changing the you
 
05:20:12.788 --> 05:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
know jail time and fines to uh already
 
05:20:15.390 --> 05:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
fit the the misdemeanor level of fenes
 
05:20:17.470 --> 05:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
um that gives law enforcement and
 
05:20:20.110 --> 05:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
prosecutors the ability of a negotiation
 
05:20:23.628 --> 05:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
tool um another thing that uh if we are
 
05:20:24.788 --> 05:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:20:28.350 --> 05:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
reduce um the penalties for for these
 
05:20:31.548 --> 05:20:31.558 align:start position:0%
crimes I think a diversion um a
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory diversion um component of that
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
would be would be wise to have and I
 
05:20:39.270 --> 05:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
understand that you can't force somebody
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
to um seek counseling or seek help but
 
05:20:46.150 --> 05:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
at the same time um we're taking away a
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
deterrent that um as in if we make it
 
05:20:52.990 --> 05:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
easier to um possess certain narcotics
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
um opioids um you know a lot of these
 
05:21:04.190 --> 05:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
drugs the class uh the schedule one two
 
05:21:06.750 --> 05:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
and three drugs are dangerous in in
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
themselves and uh taking into
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
consideration somebody's um addiction uh
 
05:21:15.910 --> 05:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
issues that they deal with I think it
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
would be important to uh add a component
 
05:21:21.708 --> 05:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
of uh drug diversion component to a bill
 
05:21:21.718 --> 05:21:30.030 align:start position:0%
of uh drug diversion component to a bill
like

05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:30.040 --> 05:21:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
this

05:21:32.990 --> 05:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:21:34.868 --> 05:21:34.878 align:start position:0%

1392 representative you here to

05:48:19.990 --> 05:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
members of the criminal justice
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is representative
 
05:48:26.430 --> 05:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
Josh adant and I am here today to uh
 
05:48:31.230 --> 05:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 1392 to uh a bill that we
 
05:48:36.030 --> 05:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
hope will reduce uh drug penalties uh
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and decriminalize drug paraphernalia um
 
05:48:41.948 --> 05:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
when representative Abramson approached
 
05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
me with this bill uh I was happy to
 
05:48:47.590 --> 05:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor because I have long believed
 
05:48:51.468 --> 05:48:51.478 align:start position:0%
that uh drug abuse is not an issue that
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
we can solve by arresting our way out of
 
05:48:56.190 --> 05:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
it uh or imprisoning our way out of it
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
sending somebody to jail for C
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
heroin methampetamine doesn't actually
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
do anything to rehabilitate that person
 
05:49:06.830 --> 05:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's cost to the taxpayers um and it
 
05:49:09.468 --> 05:49:09.478 align:start position:0%
sets them up for future issues down the
 
05:49:12.948 --> 05:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
road where um you know perhaps
 
05:49:14.548 --> 05:49:14.558 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation isn't for everybody
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps there are some folks that are
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
already you know too far gone in that
 
05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
realm and will never be able to come
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
back um but I firmly believe that we
 
05:49:23.510 --> 05:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to maybe have
 
05:49:26.430 --> 05:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
somebody get treatment versus jail um
 
05:49:28.510 --> 05:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's a benefit to them it's a benefit to
 
05:49:31.270 --> 05:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
to uh reducing our prison population and
 
05:49:32.670 --> 05:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
it's a benefit to the taxpayers that
 
05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay for it um I think
 
05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
reducing the fines um in turning some
 
05:49:40.590 --> 05:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
things into fines uh are better for
 
05:49:43.230 --> 05:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
individuals uh versus steep fines they
 
05:49:45.390 --> 05:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
might face that might have a similar
 
05:49:47.830 --> 05:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
issue that might have a similar outcome
 
05:49:50.310 --> 05:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh where they to go to jail um anybody
 
05:49:53.628 --> 05:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
that's ever been hit with a $100 $200
 
05:49:56.868 --> 05:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
$500 fine for vehicle registration um or
 
05:49:59.708 --> 05:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
anything like that um knows that that
 
05:50:02.628 --> 05:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
can spiral into a situation where
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps that person loses their vehicle
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
um it's a similar setup uh transferred
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
over to uh this issue so uh I'm happy to
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
be one of the co-sponsors on this
 
05:50:16.390 --> 05:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill and I would ask that
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
when it goes to exact session the
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:26.910 --> 05:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative

Bert thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:50:32.430 --> 05:50:32.440 align:start position:0%

05:50:35.548 --> 05:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
back the second page p uh section five
 
05:50:40.868 --> 05:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
or line five says relative to
 
05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
advertising would that
 
05:50:45.750 --> 05:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
mean you know we could advertise any
 
05:50:49.510 --> 05:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
drug on a billboard or you know what
 
05:50:55.150 --> 05:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
would that do um that I would definitely
 
05:50:56.788 --> 05:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
want to follow up with the prime sponsor
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
on uh because honly I can't 100% answer
 
05:51:01.788 --> 05:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
that with accuracy right now all right
 
05:51:01.798 --> 05:51:06.190 align:start position:0%
that with accuracy right now all right
thank

05:51:06.190 --> 05:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Lang thank you um the
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
first first sentence the repeal of the
 
05:51:14.468 --> 05:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
definition of drug pair failure the
 
05:51:16.150 --> 05:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
repeal of RSA
 
05:51:18.468 --> 05:51:18.478 align:start position:0%
318-b one
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
x-a um do you know if that are you aware
 
05:51:23.990 --> 05:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
that that definition is used in other
 
05:51:26.590 --> 05:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
statutes to make other cases things like
 
05:51:28.830 --> 05:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
intent to sell showing the possession of
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia is part of that
 
05:51:32.270 --> 05:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
making of a case without a definition
 
05:51:33.628 --> 05:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
they'd have a hard time defining what
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia is that's possible um
 
05:51:40.350 --> 05:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
that might be an area for an amendment
 
05:51:47.910 --> 05:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:51.910 --> 05:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
um if I may inquire how is there any
 
05:51:55.270 --> 05:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
information on how often an individual
 
05:51:57.670 --> 05:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is is charged with a an
 
05:51:57.680 --> 05:51:58.830 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is is charged with a an
offense

05:51:58.830 --> 05:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
offense
 
05:52:01.468 --> 05:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
where it's just relating to drug
 
05:52:03.350 --> 05:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia um I'm going to be honest
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh representative Abramson
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
texted me an hour ago and asked me to
 
05:52:12.390 --> 05:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
introduce today so uh I did not have um
 
05:52:13.830 --> 05:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
the information that I would like to
 
05:52:16.150 --> 05:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
have to answer that question um but I
 
05:52:17.190 --> 05:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
would be happy to follow up the
 
05:52:21.590 --> 05:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:24.868 --> 05:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.150 --> 05:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
you sign No Hands raised thank you
 
05:52:37.948 --> 05:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:40.310 --> 05:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
you at this time the chairman I'll Rec
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:57.160 --> 05:53:02.590 align:start position:0%
 
brgh

05:53:02.590 --> 05:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:06.110 --> 05:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
job there you go you're welcome um just
 
05:53:12.150 --> 05:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
in reference to this bill uh a couple of
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
things that uh I wanted to provide some
 
05:53:16.910 --> 05:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
information on are in my 20 years uh 20
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
plus years of law enforcement
 
05:53:21.788 --> 05:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
um there have been very few instances
 
05:53:23.830 --> 05:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
where drug paraphernalia in in and of
 
05:53:26.310 --> 05:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
itself have been used as a uh chargeable
 
05:53:28.750 --> 05:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
offense um to some answer your question
 
05:53:30.670 --> 05:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
from earlier
 
05:53:34.190 --> 05:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
um but I do believe that it would uh you
 
05:53:37.270 --> 05:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
know leaving uh the definition of drug
 
05:53:39.788 --> 05:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia uh would probably affect
 
05:53:42.390 --> 05:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
or be beneficial to other statutes that
 
05:53:45.830 --> 05:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
are out there as well as uh a lot of
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
times uh to have an extra tool as law
 
05:53:52.990 --> 05:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement um is is a good thing and
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
just some of the scenarios that I'm
 
05:53:58.230 --> 05:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
thinking of are you know a a juvenile um
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
juvenile who may have drug paraphernalia
 
05:54:02.270 --> 05:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
in a school school resource officer
 
05:54:05.910 --> 05:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
needs to have some sort of um way to to
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
interact with that or or take care of
 
05:54:10.350 --> 05:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
that situation um so those were my
 
05:54:12.468 --> 05:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that and then I'll notice on
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh line 16 and 17 uh of this bill where
 
05:54:19.628 --> 05:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
it lists uh what seemed like the more uh
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
serious drugs um with a higher um a
 
05:54:27.390 --> 05:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
higher fine as opposed to any other
 
05:54:30.030 --> 05:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
controlled drug which is in line 18 um
 
05:54:33.510 --> 05:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is not listed um in that list
 
05:54:36.110 --> 05:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
which as uh as I stated in an earlier
 
05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on a different bill um very
 
05:54:40.948 --> 05:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
small amount of fentanyl is a is a fatal
 
05:54:43.030 --> 05:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
dose so I only makes sense that that
 
05:54:45.548 --> 05:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
would be listed along with uh the more
 
05:54:48.670 --> 05:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
serious U offenses there um and that's
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:55.788 --> 05:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you uh so you you you
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill uh yes I mean generally
 
05:55:04.468 --> 05:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
as uh a representative of the New
 
05:55:06.830 --> 05:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police um I'm here to
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide information and um you know
 
05:55:11.230 --> 05:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that I can help
 
05:55:13.468 --> 05:55:13.478 align:start position:0%
with help the committee with um in this
 
05:55:15.150 --> 05:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
instance like I understand where
 
05:55:17.150 --> 05:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
everybody is going with with a lot of
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
these bills um from my own perspective I
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
you know I like to have the tools in
 
05:55:24.110 --> 05:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
place that if we need them for
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
negotiation purposes or or things like
 
05:55:27.000 --> 05:55:30.030 align:start position:0%
negotiation purposes or or things like
that

05:55:30.030 --> 05:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:33.468 --> 05:55:33.478 align:start position:0%
representative Lang thank you um but I I
 
05:55:35.708 --> 05:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
I if I'm not mistaken you said part of
 
05:55:37.468 --> 05:55:37.478 align:start position:0%
this bill would make enforcement of some
 
05:55:39.750 --> 05:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
of the drug how you how you manage and
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
create a drug case more difficult I
 
05:55:45.430 --> 05:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
think if there's a potential for that um
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
if if I you know if a case is built with
 
05:55:50.190 --> 05:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
you know not only the possession of the
 
05:55:52.390 --> 05:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
drug itself but also with paraphernalia
 
05:55:54.628 --> 05:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
that could be um you know that could be
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
beneficial to a case but I will say that
 
05:56:00.548 --> 05:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
um you most of these you know I I've
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
never seen anything that has to do with
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know relative to advertising being
 
05:56:08.070 --> 05:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
forced or um many of these other that
 
05:56:09.350 --> 05:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
are listed
 
05:56:12.670 --> 05:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.150 --> 05:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
followup you're recognize for follow so
 
05:56:16.510 --> 05:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
again so I'm going to go just to that
 
05:56:19.390 --> 05:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
advertising piece so again absent if we
 
05:56:21.628 --> 05:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
pass this bill as it's written we could
 
05:56:23.070 --> 05:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
potentially see on the side of a roads
 
05:56:26.150 --> 05:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
buy your bong here that's that appears
 
05:56:32.110 --> 05:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:37.150 --> 05:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
yes if I may inquire in on lines 12 to
 
05:56:37.160 --> 05:56:38.390 align:start position:0%
yes if I may inquire in on lines 12 to
15

05:56:38.390 --> 05:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
15
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of focus is on the
 
05:56:43.390 --> 05:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia but from lines 12 to
 
05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
15 do you have any any information or
 
05:56:49.788 --> 05:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
comment on the how that would that
 
05:56:51.868 --> 05:56:51.878 align:start position:0%
section of this bill would change
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.798 --> 05:57:09.628 align:start position:0%
 
laws

05:57:09.628 --> 05:57:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:11.788 --> 05:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
I have not looked at that uh section in
 
05:57:14.070 --> 05:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
in that regard um so I guess I don't
 
05:57:18.788 --> 05:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:25.628 --> 05:57:25.638 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:57:27.868 --> 05:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
true thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had uh in in
 
05:57:35.230 --> 05:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
looking at lines uh 16 through 19 you
 
05:57:38.350 --> 05:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
had said that it doesn't include
 
05:57:40.670 --> 05:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
fentanyl you saying it doesn't mention
 
05:57:43.910 --> 05:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
it or you have looked at all the
 
05:57:47.990 --> 05:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
rsas and it's excluding fentel from
 
05:57:50.990 --> 05:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
this uh from what just looking at this
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
bill as it's as it's written I did not
 
05:57:57.030 --> 05:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
see fentanyl listed um which in my in my
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
understanding if understand not
 
05:58:01.150 --> 05:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly um you know
 
05:58:02.910 --> 05:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine as well but it it it looks
 
05:58:06.270 --> 05:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
like fenel would fall under uh category
 
05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:18.430 --> 05:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.150 --> 05:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
you seeing No Hands raised thank you for
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:26.718 --> 05:58:32.868 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:34.430 --> 05:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
this time we will now close the public
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.638 --> 05:59:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
1392

05:59:09.350 --> 05:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:10.910 --> 05:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
this time we are going to open the
 
05:59:15.310 --> 05:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
1392 representative Roy you wish to be
 
05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
recognized to make a
 
05:59:22.590 --> 05:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
motion I do thank you I would move in
 
05:59:26.190 --> 05:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.708 --> 05:59:29.718 align:start position:0%
legislate guys been seconded by
 
05:59:29.718 --> 05:59:32.910 align:start position:0%
legislate guys been seconded by
representative

05:59:32.910 --> 05:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:35.590 --> 05:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
testman anyone representative Ro wish to
 
05:59:36.910 --> 05:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the
 
05:59:40.030 --> 05:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
motion I will
 
05:59:40.040 --> 05:59:46.910 align:start position:0%
motion I will
represent

05:59:46.910 --> 05:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:51.150 --> 05:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
justy I'm not going to get all of it but
 
05:59:53.310 --> 05:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
05:59:57.788 --> 05:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
mean even allowing road signs billboard
 
06:00:03.230 --> 06:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
s with advertising is bad enough uh the
 
06:00:06.628 --> 06:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
issue of essentially giving the away
 
06:00:10.350 --> 06:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia as a a leveraged
 
06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
school resource officers is is bad
 
06:00:16.830 --> 06:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
enough but you get down further
 
06:00:20.548 --> 06:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
and you look they list
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
a several drugs and I'm not sure if
 
06:00:27.030 --> 06:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're all there but certainly pentos
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
is not there and I don't know what would
 
06:00:31.990 --> 06:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
happen if something worse than final
 
06:00:37.390 --> 06:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
comes on the market and so I just
 
06:00:39.628 --> 06:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
think I don't know what they were trying
 
06:00:47.628 --> 06:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
to do except feel good and I know Max
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
fairly try not to speak speak to the
 
06:00:54.670 --> 06:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
motives of that but but in any case U
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:08.830 --> 06:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
just to raise a
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
concern paraphernalia argum one but if
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
you go from lines 12 to the end I mean
 
06:01:18.628 --> 06:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
essentially if there's any type of drug
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
transaction or drug offense that doesn't
 
06:01:23.190 --> 06:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
involve an act of violence the penalties
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
in change $40 per gram or $20 per gram
 
06:01:30.270 --> 06:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
substance I I think that's I understand
 
06:01:34.390 --> 06:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
the motivation but I think that's going
 
06:01:36.910 --> 06:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
too far too quickly I'm not sure if
 
06:01:38.270 --> 06:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
someone interprets it any differently
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
did I think that's a that's a extreme
 
06:01:48.510 --> 06:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
direction to go from where we are now to
 
06:01:53.070 --> 06:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.590 --> 06:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
smooth seeing no for representative
 
06:01:56.600 --> 06:02:01.868 align:start position:0%
smooth seeing no for representative
Balden

06:02:01.868 --> 06:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
um if I understand correctly the
 
06:02:06.350 --> 06:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
06:02:06.360 --> 06:02:08.270 align:start position:0%
concerns about
fentanyl

06:02:08.270 --> 06:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
fentanyl
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
um my my understanding for example is
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
that methamphetamine came about when
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
cocaine was made illegal as an
 
06:02:18.670 --> 06:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
alternative to cocaine that was not yet
 
06:02:21.468 --> 06:02:21.478 align:start position:0%
illegal and methamphetamine presents a
 
06:02:24.190 --> 06:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
whole host of problems obviously worse
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
than those presented by
 
06:02:29.270 --> 06:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
cocaine it seems that similarly the
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
inability to
 
06:02:34.468 --> 06:02:34.478 align:start position:0%
access less dangerous opiates has led to
 
06:02:37.270 --> 06:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
the use of fental which is otherwise
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
regularly used medically there are
 
06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
cancer patients that wear fentel patches
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
because of the extreme pain of the the
 
06:02:46.868 --> 06:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
process uh that they're going
 
06:02:50.110 --> 06:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
through um so I wonder
 
06:02:53.788 --> 06:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
if there if there was less personal
 
06:02:56.990 --> 06:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
Liberty at stake in using the less
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
Danger ous drugs if people would opt for
 
06:03:02.350 --> 06:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
them more often and would be less
 
06:03:06.510 --> 06:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
inclined to take risks with drugs like
 
06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
fenel just a just a thought to throw out
 
06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:16.868 --> 06:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy you recognize um
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
the Representative makes a good point
 
06:03:22.910 --> 06:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
however the problem with opiates is not
 
06:03:25.510 --> 06:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
only are they addicting there's also a
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
tolerance level so even making oxycoton
 
06:03:30.958 --> 06:03:32.350 align:start position:0%
tolerance level so even making oxycoton
um

06:03:32.350 --> 06:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:34.590 --> 06:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
legal what would happen is you'd
 
06:03:36.150 --> 06:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
eventually build up such a tolerance
 
06:03:37.868 --> 06:03:37.878 align:start position:0%
level that you would naturally have to
 
06:03:39.270 --> 06:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
go to something stronger and you'd be
 
06:03:42.830 --> 06:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
directed to fenel anyway um they build a
 
06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
incredible tolerance quickly
 
06:03:48.990 --> 06:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
so being able saying that you know well
 
06:03:51.390 --> 06:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll stop it that it would be
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
great but unfortunately the body builds
 
06:03:55.270 --> 06:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
such a quick resistance to it that's why
 
06:03:56.910 --> 06:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
people that are on opioids prescription
 
06:03:59.390 --> 06:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
opio oids generally at least once a year
 
06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
have to up their up their amount to get
 
06:04:03.708 --> 06:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
the same relief from the pain and the
 
06:04:05.510 --> 06:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
same thing goes for people that use a
 
06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
recreationally they need more and more
 
06:04:09.030 --> 06:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
and more to get high eventually they end
 
06:04:11.548 --> 06:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
up on fendal heroin anyway
 
06:04:15.788 --> 06:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
so that's my my two SS on
 
06:04:18.750 --> 06:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
that I would just point out lines 25 to
 
06:04:21.310 --> 06:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
27 also would conflict with the last two
 
06:04:22.750 --> 06:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:26.160 --> 06:04:30.548 align:start position:0%
 
heard

06:04:30.548 --> 06:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
being House Bill 1360 and House Bill
 
06:04:36.548 --> 06:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
1232 so again it would be hard to
 
06:04:36.558 --> 06:04:37.548 align:start position:0%
1232 so again it would be hard to
support

06:04:37.548 --> 06:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:04:39.390 --> 06:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
this you would have have to make an
 
06:04:40.910 --> 06:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and strike that part that
 
06:04:44.110 --> 06:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
language was in
 
06:04:46.788 --> 06:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
Bal seeing as we can't guarantee how any
 
06:04:48.110 --> 06:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
particular bill is going to pan out we
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
have to only vote on the bill in front
 
06:04:52.150 --> 06:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
of us um but I just thought it might be
 
06:04:52.160 --> 06:04:53.070 align:start position:0%
of us um but I just thought it might be
worth

06:04:53.070 --> 06:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
worth
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying um my comments earlier I I
 
06:04:59.548 --> 06:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
think that fentanyl is is known to be
 
06:05:02.430 --> 06:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
more dangerous than other opiates and so
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
I think that from the perspective of
 
06:05:08.110 --> 06:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
risking your life by using the only drug
 
06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
you can
 
06:05:12.350 --> 06:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
find or being
 
06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
sober you know I think that they would
 
06:05:17.788 --> 06:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:21.670 --> 06:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
to um to unfortunately choose the more
 
06:05:24.110 --> 06:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
life-threatening option and I would hope
 
06:05:27.390 --> 06:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
that if there were less um personal
 
06:05:29.948 --> 06:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
Liberty at risk a lower likelihood of
 
06:05:31.750 --> 06:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
imprisonment if they choose a different
 
06:05:34.510 --> 06:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
drug then um they would go for the less
 
06:05:37.468 --> 06:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
uh personally Dangerous Drug at not
 
06:05:40.628 --> 06:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:45.230 --> 06:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:47.430 --> 06:05:47.440 align:start position:0%

Welch anyone wish to speak to that
 
06:09:09.070 --> 06:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
motion uh I would say that um we will be
 
06:09:12.150 --> 06:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony on another bill 1360
 
06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
that is currently in drafting for a
 
06:09:17.868 --> 06:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
small Amendment it's much simpler um it
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
still starts us down the correct path of
 
06:09:22.990 --> 06:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
reducing the uh felony sentences without
 
06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
becoming so complex as to have a little
 
06:09:27.548 --> 06:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
chance of coming out the way it left
 
06:09:29.150 --> 06:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
once it reaches the other
 
06:09:32.590 --> 06:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
body um so for that reason I would
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that we interm study this and we
 
06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
take up the next one 1360 when it comes
 
06:09:41.548 --> 06:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
down representative
 
06:09:44.150 --> 06:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
testman I was just going to ask what the
 
06:09:47.390 --> 06:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh what the strategy was here and
 
06:09:50.670 --> 06:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
basically put this on aside and take
 
06:09:55.070 --> 06:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:06.110 --> 06:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%

06:34:37.030 --> 06:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
first yeah 88h Hotel um so after
 
06:34:39.990 --> 06:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussion during the hearing um we
 
06:34:41.230 --> 06:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about the
 
06:34:44.388 --> 06:34:44.398 align:start position:0%
fines and um representative Lang pointed
 
06:34:45.990 --> 06:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
out that
 
06:34:49.030 --> 06:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
um these fines are not the standard
 
06:34:51.150 --> 06:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
fines for felonies and misdemeanors in
 
06:34:52.868 --> 06:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
our statute they had been at some point
 
06:34:55.468 --> 06:34:55.478 align:start position:0%
in the past artificially enhanced
 
06:34:59.590 --> 06:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
um 50,000 and 25,000 are not the fines
 
06:35:01.868 --> 06:35:01.878 align:start position:0%
um that are defined in statute for every
 
06:35:06.030 --> 06:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
other felony Mr meor um so what we did
 
06:35:09.310 --> 06:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
was we just took out the number amounts
 
06:35:11.990 --> 06:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that is up to the judge to decide the
 
06:35:14.948 --> 06:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
fine based on the existing statutory
 
06:35:17.830 --> 06:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
fines for misdemeanors and
 
06:35:21.830 --> 06:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
felonies um which are $1,200 for a
 
06:35:23.388 --> 06:35:23.398 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor is that
 
06:35:23.398 --> 06:35:27.910 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor is that
correct

06:35:27.910 --> 06:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:28.750 --> 06:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lane you wish to be
 
06:35:31.388 --> 06:35:31.398 align:start position:0%
recognized correct thank you so for um
 
06:35:33.190 --> 06:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
correct for a misdemeanor depending
 
06:35:35.708 --> 06:35:35.718 align:start position:0%
whether it's a or b it's a $1,200 fine
 
06:35:38.788 --> 06:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
,000 f $200 penal assessment for an A or
 
06:35:41.548 --> 06:35:41.558 align:start position:0%
for B B misdemeanor it's $1,000 fine Max
 
06:35:44.070 --> 06:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
or a violation it's a $1,000 Max so this
 
06:35:47.230 --> 06:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
would put this law into alignment with
 
06:35:49.468 --> 06:35:49.478 align:start position:0%
our standard fine and penalty schedule
 
06:35:51.708 --> 06:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
rather than any special enhanced
 
06:35:55.230 --> 06:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
penalties thank you

Ro do you mind just explaining the the
 
06:38:07.110 --> 06:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
motion that is pending
 
06:38:10.310 --> 06:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure um the the pending motion is an
 
06:38:13.670 --> 06:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB
 
06:38:15.948 --> 06:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
1361 no excuse me
 
06:38:17.868 --> 06:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
1360 and it
 
06:38:20.830 --> 06:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
is amendment number
 
06:38:25.910 --> 06:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
0088 after the um after the hearing um
 
06:38:29.030 --> 06:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
and some discussion we decided that
 
06:38:31.830 --> 06:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
rather than set specific fines um
 
06:38:35.270 --> 06:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the statute as it is um in
 
06:38:37.430 --> 06:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
our criminal statutes felony and
 
06:38:40.110 --> 06:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor already have uh assigned
 
06:38:42.868 --> 06:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
fine amounts and at some point in the
 
06:38:46.190 --> 06:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
past they were inflated specifically for
 
06:38:48.510 --> 06:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
drug crimes to $ 25 and
 
06:38:51.310 --> 06:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
$50,000 so we thought it best to just go
 
06:38:52.750 --> 06:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
back so that it fell in line with the
 
06:38:55.070 --> 06:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the statutes for felony
 
06:38:57.510 --> 06:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors which are substantially
 
06:39:00.030 --> 06:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
less um so we took the fine amounts out
 
06:39:02.350 --> 06:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
and it's up to the judge on what amount
 
06:39:07.708 --> 06:39:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:11.468 --> 06:39:11.478 align:start position:0%
impose and we just pass that Amendment
 
06:39:16.830 --> 06:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:23.040 --> 06:39:26.230 align:start position:0%

06:42:23.230 --> 06:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
um as I um said during the introduction
 
06:42:24.350 --> 06:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
06:42:28.230 --> 06:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
this creates a separate um charge for
 
06:42:28.240 --> 06:42:29.468 align:start position:0%
this creates a separate um charge for
anyone

06:42:29.468 --> 06:42:29.478 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
06:42:32.070 --> 06:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
importing drugs controlled substances
 
06:42:33.910 --> 06:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
into the state of New Hampshire for the
 
06:42:34.990 --> 06:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
purpose to
 
06:42:38.548 --> 06:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
sell um the amendment changes the
 
06:42:42.110 --> 06:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
original bill in this amendment totally
 
06:42:45.750 --> 06:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
eliminates cannabis type drugs from the
 
06:42:50.030 --> 06:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill um the reason for that being there
 
06:42:52.430 --> 06:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
are surrounding states and there are
 
06:42:54.430 --> 06:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
issues regarding how much someone can
 
06:42:56.868 --> 06:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
possess underneath the medical exception
 
06:42:58.590 --> 06:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
in this state versus other states and
 
06:42:59.990 --> 06:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are also different cannabis
 
06:43:04.670 --> 06:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
products such as Edibles and such um so
 
06:43:06.350 --> 06:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
we felt it best to just leave cannabis
 
06:43:10.948 --> 06:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
out of it um so the remaining drugs um
 
06:43:13.910 --> 06:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
on the schedule are still there and so
 
06:43:16.070 --> 06:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
what this is is you would have to have
 
06:43:18.110 --> 06:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
an amount that would constitute
 
06:43:20.670 --> 06:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
distribution for this charge to
 
06:43:25.310 --> 06:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
apply and that's it
 
06:43:27.628 --> 06:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
oh I would add one more thing as I said
 
06:43:29.670 --> 06:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
um for some folks who may not have been
 
06:43:32.110 --> 06:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
here I did a lot of research on this and
 
06:43:33.830 --> 06:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are many states that have crimes
 
06:43:35.948 --> 06:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
like this including California where
 
06:43:37.590 --> 06:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
they charge you an extra there's an
 
06:43:39.948 --> 06:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
extra charge uh criminal charge for
 
06:43:41.548 --> 06:43:41.558 align:start position:0%
importing drugs into the state for
 
06:43:43.910 --> 06:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
distribution so this we we would not be
 
06:43:46.230 --> 06:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
by any stretch of the imagination um
 
06:43:51.070 --> 06:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:55.310 --> 06:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
this representative Colley you recognize
 
06:43:56.628 --> 06:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this question is
 
06:43:59.070 --> 06:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
for the sponsor if I may
 
06:44:01.350 --> 06:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
um and forgive me if you addressed this
 
06:44:04.310 --> 06:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier but I and I mean this truly in
 
06:44:05.670 --> 06:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
good faith I don't understand the need
 
06:44:07.708 --> 06:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
for this bill would this not be covered
 
06:44:10.750 --> 06:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
under a under a federal statute already
 
06:44:12.910 --> 06:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
um would our existing
 
06:44:16.270 --> 06:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
trafficking uh statute not address this
 
06:44:17.750 --> 06:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand why this
 
06:44:20.310 --> 06:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
particular law would be necessary and
 
06:44:21.750 --> 06:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
how it might be applied would this be
 
06:44:24.510 --> 06:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
tacked on to to separate drug charges
 
06:44:28.110 --> 06:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
would this be a standalone if I had you
 
06:44:30.030 --> 06:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
know a large quantity in my vehicle and
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
I was on exit 2 I I'm just really trying
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
to better understand it no sure and that
 
06:44:37.270 --> 06:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely right um so the reason
 
06:44:39.788 --> 06:44:39.798 align:start position:0%
for the bill in the first place is as we
 
06:44:43.070 --> 06:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
all know um we have an incredible opioid
 
06:44:45.468 --> 06:44:45.478 align:start position:0%
crisis in the state among other things
 
06:44:48.110 --> 06:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
and we also know that the vast majority
 
06:44:51.070 --> 06:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
and this is um been held up by law
 
06:44:52.830 --> 06:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the courts the vast
 
06:44:54.350 --> 06:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
majority of our drugs are coming from
 
06:44:55.990 --> 06:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
across the southern border or across the
 
06:44:57.388 --> 06:44:57.398 align:start position:0%
border they're not made here
 
06:44:59.750 --> 06:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured here then being brought in
 
06:45:01.708 --> 06:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
so the impetus for dis spill and we've
 
06:45:03.430 --> 06:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
tried a million other ways to get try to
 
06:45:05.868 --> 06:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
get a handle on this opioid crisis this
 
06:45:07.110 --> 06:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully would be something that would
 
06:45:11.030 --> 06:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
at least create um a hesitancy in
 
06:45:13.270 --> 06:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
someone say from LEL or Lawrence loading
 
06:45:15.070 --> 06:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
up their car heading up to NASA with a
 
06:45:17.230 --> 06:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
car full of drugs this would add be an
 
06:45:18.788 --> 06:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
additional charge available to law
 
06:45:20.750 --> 06:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement it wouldn't be in lie of it
 
06:45:23.468 --> 06:45:23.478 align:start position:0%
would be in addition to um the exist
 
06:45:25.910 --> 06:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
listing and it would create a class a
 
06:45:27.590 --> 06:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
felony and their vehicle would be
 
06:45:28.910 --> 06:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
subject to forfeiture that they were
 
06:45:31.350 --> 06:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
using to transport the drugs in and if I
 
06:45:33.150 --> 06:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
can just clarified this the question
 
06:45:35.510 --> 06:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to move is whether to
 
06:45:36.990 --> 06:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment which is the same as
 
06:45:38.350 --> 06:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
the oning bill we're just removing
 
06:45:41.110 --> 06:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis from it so you may have some
 
06:45:43.430 --> 06:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
issues with the underlying of the policy
 
06:45:46.270 --> 06:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
as a whole but I get the feeling that
 
06:45:48.708 --> 06:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
some members May least be fond of the
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment by excluding candidates Point
 
06:46:07.830 --> 06:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:12.670 --> 06:46:12.680 align:start position:0%

now be put to question if you in support

06:48:31.110 --> 06:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:52.110 --> 06:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:52.120 --> 06:48:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
GFF

06:48:57.830 --> 06:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:00.548 --> 06:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
representative Roy thank you if I could
 
06:49:03.750 --> 06:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
just address the the federal question
 
06:49:06.788 --> 06:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
um to get the US attorney to take up a
 
06:49:09.948 --> 06:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
case um is really um requires a divine
 
06:49:12.388 --> 06:49:12.398 align:start position:0%
intervention is unless it's a really
 
06:49:16.990 --> 06:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
really large amount um second of
 
06:49:20.030 --> 06:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
all well first of all that that applies
 
06:49:21.670 --> 06:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
in other words a New Hampshire police
 
06:49:23.868 --> 06:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
officer would have to make a stop make
 
06:49:25.868 --> 06:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
an arrest and someone would have to
 
06:49:27.350 --> 06:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
reach out to the US attorney's office
 
06:49:28.510 --> 06:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
and see if they were interested in
 
06:49:31.350 --> 06:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting the case there are no U
 
06:49:32.948 --> 06:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
there is no policing of the interstate
 
06:49:35.590 --> 06:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
borders by federal law enforcement um
 
06:49:37.150 --> 06:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
unless it's an ongoing investigation
 
06:49:38.628 --> 06:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
where they're actually following someone
 
06:49:40.270 --> 06:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
back and forth so it really is up to the
 
06:49:44.830 --> 06:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
own States um to to try and get police
 
06:49:47.708 --> 06:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
what gets into their state um otherwise
 
06:49:50.150 --> 06:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
we would see a lot less drugs and a lot
 
06:49:52.430 --> 06:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
more Federal prosecutions but we don't
 
06:49:55.430 --> 06:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I agree that it would be
 
06:49:57.430 --> 06:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
in an Ideal World the DEA would handle
 
06:49:58.948 --> 06:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
all these and the US attorney would be
 
06:50:00.868 --> 06:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
prosecuting them but it's just not the
 
06:50:02.948 --> 06:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
case it's not
 
06:50:06.030 --> 06:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
happening representative Lang thank you
 
06:50:07.868 --> 06:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chair again you know I I agree
 
06:50:09.510 --> 06:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative Roy that that getting a
 
06:50:11.388 --> 06:50:11.398 align:start position:0%
US Attorney office involved in drug
 
06:50:13.590 --> 06:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
cases next to Impossible unless you're
 
06:50:17.350 --> 06:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with a truckload of of drugs um
 
06:50:19.910 --> 06:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
addition to that understand that this is
 
06:50:22.430 --> 06:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to keep people out of keep
 
06:50:23.750 --> 06:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
people from trans transporting into the
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
state right that's the goal of the bill
 
06:50:28.190 --> 06:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
is to add a penalty so you bring drugs
 
06:50:29.350 --> 06:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
into the state not only going to be
 
06:50:30.230 --> 06:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
charged with the drugs you're going to
 
06:50:31.628 --> 06:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
be charged with the transportation of
 
06:50:33.548 --> 06:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
those drugs into our state keep your
 
06:50:35.190 --> 06:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
drugs in your own State you want to sell
 
06:50:36.510 --> 06:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
them in your state let your local police
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
or State Police deal with it but New
 
06:50:39.468 --> 06:50:39.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to crack down on this
 
06:50:41.868 --> 06:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
and I think this protects our citizens
 
06:50:43.350 --> 06:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
um from those people who would choose to
 
06:50:46.230 --> 06:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
come up from different parts of the
 
06:50:48.190 --> 06:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
country just to speak on that
 
06:50:49.830 --> 06:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lang it's a point well
 
06:50:52.070 --> 06:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
taken I've never heard of a situation
 
06:50:53.990 --> 06:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
where someone
 
06:50:56.070 --> 06:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer created fentanyl in the
 
06:50:58.270 --> 06:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I feel like that
 
06:50:59.548 --> 06:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
would have made the paper so that's
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
being imported from otate and the find
 
06:51:03.468 --> 06:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
this way here and there's people
 
06:51:03.478 --> 06:51:05.110 align:start position:0%
this way here and there's people
dying

06:51:05.110 --> 06:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
dying
 
06:51:08.350 --> 06:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
so this this is the hope to deter that
 
06:51:10.788 --> 06:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bert you recognize uh
 
06:51:12.590 --> 06:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I do have a
 
06:51:15.868 --> 06:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
question what is the amount that would
 
06:51:18.948 --> 06:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
have to be brought across the border you
 
06:51:21.948 --> 06:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
know in order for this to kick
 
06:51:21.958 --> 06:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
know in order for this to kick
in

06:51:23.990 --> 06:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:51:25.708 --> 06:51:25.718 align:start position:0%
representative Roy you may respond to
 
06:51:27.788 --> 06:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
that it um representative thank you for
 
06:51:30.270 --> 06:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
the question it is it's really different
 
06:51:32.430 --> 06:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
according to each drug how much the
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
threshold is for intent to distribute um
 
06:51:38.628 --> 06:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
and the court has certain guidelines
 
06:51:42.430 --> 06:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
they go by um where it's not statutorily
 
06:51:44.948 --> 06:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
spelled out specifically like was was it
 
06:51:47.830 --> 06:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
was it packaged for individual resale um
 
06:51:49.430 --> 06:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
how much was it that it was obviously
 
06:51:51.230 --> 06:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
not for your personal consumption so
 
06:51:53.468 --> 06:51:53.478 align:start position:0%
it's a kind of a case by case b B on
 
06:51:55.070 --> 06:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
each each one's
 
06:51:57.910 --> 06:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
different so there's no set amount that
 
06:52:00.388 --> 06:52:00.398 align:start position:0%
no no no there's there's no set amount
 
06:52:02.590 --> 06:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
that would trigger it it's a it's a
 
06:52:04.548 --> 06:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
totality of all the information
 
06:52:06.990 --> 06:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
available you having large sums of cash
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
with if you have a a controlled
 
06:52:11.270 --> 06:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
substance in you know a bunch of
 
06:52:13.510 --> 06:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
different bags having a scale is
 
06:52:17.190 --> 06:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
often a sign of it's Le evidence of
 
06:52:19.548 --> 06:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
distribution of the intend to distribute
 
06:52:22.030 --> 06:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
and one other question yes you're
 
06:52:23.150 --> 06:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
recognized all right thank thank you Mr
 
06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
chairman um on the seizure of the car is
 
06:52:31.628 --> 06:52:31.638 align:start position:0%
that our ready law this just you know
 
06:52:35.708 --> 06:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:38.270 --> 06:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
line my understanding is that if you're
 
06:52:41.270 --> 06:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
using a motor vehicle in as in the
 
06:52:43.628 --> 06:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
course of using it to actually sell or
 
06:52:47.070 --> 06:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
distribute drugs then it can be seize
 
06:52:49.548 --> 06:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
yes yeah currently all right thank you
 
06:52:53.628 --> 06:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
and and the FEDS sees that and homes and
 
06:52:53.638 --> 06:52:56.430 align:start position:0%
and and the FEDS sees that and homes and
everything

06:52:56.430 --> 06:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:58.750 --> 06:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
06:53:02.070 --> 06:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
true thank you Mr chair Mr J more of a
 
06:53:04.190 --> 06:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
question to you can you tell me what the
 
06:53:07.388 --> 06:53:07.398 align:start position:0%
current law is in New Hampshire
 
06:53:07.398 --> 06:53:09.430 align:start position:0%
current law is in New Hampshire
for

06:53:09.430 --> 06:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:53:13.948 --> 06:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:17.030 --> 06:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
distribute it's it's under the chapter
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's actually listed uh 38 318
 
06:53:24.628 --> 06:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
uh B but I just explained that it's it's
 
06:53:26.350 --> 06:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
a totality of the circumstances they're
 
06:53:28.590 --> 06:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
not going to just Define it specifically
 
06:53:30.788 --> 06:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
as what
 
06:53:32.708 --> 06:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
constitutes possession with intended to
 
06:53:34.830 --> 06:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
distribute what it is is that you can
 
06:53:36.708 --> 06:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
have a very small amount of a controlled
 
06:53:39.788 --> 06:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
substance but if you have a scale and
 
06:53:42.830 --> 06:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's and it's in 15 or 20 different bags
 
06:53:44.990 --> 06:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
that could be evidence of possession
 
06:53:46.468 --> 06:53:46.478 align:start position:0%
with intent to distribute it doesn't
 
06:53:49.548 --> 06:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that you are but it can
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
be representative true thank you Mr
 
06:53:54.708 --> 06:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
chair no I mean what's the what's the is
 
06:53:58.270 --> 06:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
it a Class A F F is it a class B felony
 
06:54:00.868 --> 06:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to be charged with the
 
06:54:04.190 --> 06:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:07.628 --> 06:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
distribute um repres representative TR I
 
06:54:09.708 --> 06:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
mean representative Ro you may respond I
 
06:54:11.750 --> 06:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
have um just been informed that it is
 
06:54:14.830 --> 06:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
already a Class A so this is not
 
06:54:17.468 --> 06:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
a intend to distribute as a Class A
 
06:54:17.478 --> 06:54:21.230 align:start position:0%
a intend to distribute as a Class A
right

06:54:21.230 --> 06:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:24.468 --> 06:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
now representative Conley thank you Mr
 
06:54:26.110 --> 06:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and I'm glad that the
 
06:54:28.990 --> 06:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned that so it's
 
06:54:31.230 --> 06:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
already a class a
 
06:54:34.548 --> 06:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
felony to have a certain quantity of
 
06:54:36.670 --> 06:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
drugs with the intent to distribute
 
06:54:38.310 --> 06:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
hitting someone with a second felony I'm
 
06:54:41.708 --> 06:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
not sure what the net effect of that is
 
06:54:43.788 --> 06:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
um I I really do believe this is well
 
06:54:43.798 --> 06:54:46.030 align:start position:0%
um I I really do believe this is well
intentioned

06:54:46.030 --> 06:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
intentioned
 
06:54:48.830 --> 06:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
um but it's already covered under
 
06:54:51.388 --> 06:54:51.398 align:start position:0%
existing statute it creates a mandatory
 
06:54:54.670 --> 06:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
minimum that that uh members of both
 
06:54:57.548 --> 06:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
parties have worked to get rid of and
 
06:55:02.030 --> 06:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
remove um and it's I think vague on
 
06:55:03.430 --> 06:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
substance we just learned from the
 
06:55:06.468 --> 06:55:06.478 align:start position:0%
chairman that even a small substance of
 
06:55:09.230 --> 06:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
this could trigger this uh under the
 
06:55:11.510 --> 06:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
statute and as I read it it would need
 
06:55:13.230 --> 06:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
to already be paired with an existing
 
06:55:16.070 --> 06:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
class a felony so um with that I won't
 
06:55:19.490 --> 06:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
support this um and I'll stop
 
06:55:19.500 --> 06:55:21.590 align:start position:0%
support this um and I'll stop
[Music]

06:55:21.590 --> 06:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:55:21.600 --> 06:55:23.150 align:start position:0%
[Music]
there

06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:55:26.548 --> 06:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
representative Roy you may respond um
 
06:55:29.110 --> 06:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
you are correct it would be um two
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
felonies this is an enhancement um and
 
06:55:33.670 --> 06:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
it does you're also correct it creates a
 
06:55:37.910 --> 06:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
minimum mandatory um and the and you're
 
06:55:39.628 --> 06:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
also correct that we are trying to get
 
06:55:42.430 --> 06:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
away from a lot of mandatories but that
 
06:55:44.628 --> 06:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean every single one and and we
 
06:55:47.110 --> 06:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
have so many people dying right now in
 
06:55:48.830 --> 06:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
this state of drugs that are coming
 
06:55:52.270 --> 06:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
across our border um so as to rival some
 
06:55:54.910 --> 06:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
of the other most recent causes of death
 
06:55:57.150 --> 06:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
and those we can't do anything about but
 
06:55:59.350 --> 06:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
this we can and if we can at least
 
06:56:01.868 --> 06:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
discourage somebody and they say wait a
 
06:56:03.430 --> 06:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
minute if I get caught going across the
 
06:56:05.510 --> 06:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
border with this I'm doing five years
 
06:56:09.590 --> 06:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm losing my car um I just I feel
 
06:56:11.468 --> 06:56:11.478 align:start position:0%
like it's it's it's the least we can do
 
06:56:13.430 --> 06:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
to try and protect our children and and
 
06:56:14.830 --> 06:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
the people of the state that are dying
 
06:56:17.468 --> 06:56:17.478 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and it's overwhelming
 
06:56:21.070 --> 06:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:23.310 --> 06:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
Responders and I can to speak to that
 
06:56:25.190 --> 06:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we're based on the community that I
 
06:56:27.190 --> 06:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
live in the district that I represent is
 
06:56:30.708 --> 06:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
a Border Town that's not too far from an
 
06:56:33.388 --> 06:56:33.398 align:start position:0%
area where drug trafficking specifically
 
06:56:36.788 --> 06:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
fentanyl has been widely publicized as a
 
06:56:40.430 --> 06:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
huge problem so again the fentanyl is
 
06:56:42.990 --> 06:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
not made in New Hampshire I've never had
 
06:56:44.628 --> 06:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
any evidence of that but it's being
 
06:56:47.070 --> 06:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
brought here and imported here and that
 
06:56:48.750 --> 06:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
the mere fact that you're bringing the
 
06:56:51.190 --> 06:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
fentanyl to this state is what I'm
 
06:56:53.430 --> 06:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
really what I'm really focusing on
 
06:56:57.190 --> 06:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:00.030 --> 06:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
people represented Balden you
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
recognized but doesn't this bill cover
 
06:57:04.510 --> 06:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
more than fentel is that
 
06:57:11.270 --> 06:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:13.788 --> 06:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Lang do you recognize
 
06:57:15.590 --> 06:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
so the only as a again as an element of
 
06:57:17.990 --> 06:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
the crime they have to prove as part of
 
06:57:20.030 --> 06:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
this transportation is the intent to
 
06:57:22.388 --> 06:57:22.398 align:start position:0%
distribute right the intent to sell so
 
06:57:23.868 --> 06:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
so again we're talking about commercial
 
06:57:25.388 --> 06:57:25.398 align:start position:0%
drug dealers who are moving coming in
 
06:57:27.190 --> 06:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
from out of state to sell to our
 
06:57:30.750 --> 06:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
citizens and this law goes it would be
 
06:57:33.548 --> 06:57:33.558 align:start position:0%
an enhanced penalty to say stay in your
 
06:57:40.590 --> 06:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:43.830 --> 06:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
06:57:46.628 --> 06:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
Newman what effect would this have on
 
06:57:50.430 --> 06:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
someone who goes to Massachusetts or LEL
 
06:57:55.910 --> 06:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe is user and they they be they
 
06:57:59.548 --> 06:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
prepackage something am a certain amount
 
06:58:02.468 --> 06:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
of maybe a stale is involed or whatever
 
06:58:05.190 --> 06:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
the circumstances are that Prov that
 
06:58:06.670 --> 06:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
that they would come back and then be
 
06:58:08.430 --> 06:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
punished by not only felony but the
 
06:58:08.440 --> 06:58:09.708 align:start position:0%
punished by not only felony but the
minimum

06:58:09.708 --> 06:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
06:58:11.868 --> 06:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
felony all of
 
06:58:15.030 --> 06:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
that absolutely most egregious thing I
 
06:58:18.310 --> 06:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
take care is minimum minimum penalty
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
just won't be able to support this
 
06:58:21.320 --> 06:58:25.230 align:start position:0%
just won't be able to support this
bu

06:58:25.230 --> 06:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:25.240 --> 06:58:51.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:58:51.230 --> 06:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:51.240 --> 06:58:55.270 align:start position:0%
 
pantelakis

06:58:55.270 --> 06:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:57.030 --> 06:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative Conley thank you Mr
 
06:58:59.350 --> 06:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
chairman very quick um the one final
 
06:59:01.910 --> 06:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
point I would make is that the kingpins
 
06:59:04.310 --> 06:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
the the real bad actors are not the ones
 
06:59:07.270 --> 06:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel these are low-level
 
06:59:09.948 --> 06:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
people who are not actively engaged
 
06:59:12.110 --> 06:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
typically not always typically not
 
06:59:14.510 --> 06:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
actively engaged who are doing the
 
06:59:16.990 --> 06:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
transportation this is not going to stop
 
06:59:19.388 --> 06:59:19.398 align:start position:0%
the flow of drugs into our state it is
 
06:59:20.990 --> 06:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
just going to mean more people serve
 
06:59:23.270 --> 06:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
more time for it while the next person
 
06:59:26.150 --> 06:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
in line uh willingly grabs the wheel and
 
06:59:28.070 --> 06:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
makes the next delivery and I wish it
 
06:59:34.948 --> 06:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:38.590 --> 06:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
is at this time the representative true
 
06:59:41.310 --> 06:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:44.230 --> 06:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
recognized I apologize a question of the
 
06:59:45.590 --> 06:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
chair because you're have a
 
06:59:48.990 --> 06:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer um a class a
 
06:59:52.590 --> 06:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
felony uh conviction will result in a 7
 
06:59:54.468 --> 06:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
and a half year incarceration of not
 
06:59:56.030 --> 06:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
more than 15
 
07:00:01.110 --> 07:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
years uh and fines of up to 4,000 so H
 
07:00:03.948 --> 07:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
how would this work that if
 
07:00:08.628 --> 07:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
you're found guilty of importing with
 
07:00:12.548 --> 07:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
intent to sell and intent to
 
07:00:14.910 --> 07:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
sell you would get seven and a half
 
07:00:17.750 --> 07:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:21.868 --> 07:00:21.878 align:start position:0%
least plus a minimum of five years how I
 
07:00:24.708 --> 07:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
mean how would the judge rule on
 
07:00:28.310 --> 07:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
that there can be concurrent sentences
 
07:00:28.320 --> 07:00:34.388 align:start position:0%
that there can be concurrent sentences
consecutive

07:00:34.388 --> 07:00:34.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:40.110 --> 07:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:43.590 --> 07:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
canp may you may respond to that it's
 
07:00:45.788 --> 07:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that um on the
 
07:00:47.510 --> 07:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
class felony the one that the
 
07:00:49.110 --> 07:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative true just brought out the
 
07:00:52.430 --> 07:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
first instance um it's it's not a
 
07:00:56.190 --> 07:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory so it could be suspended um
 
07:00:58.590 --> 07:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
there this is mandatory so there'd be no
 
07:01:00.788 --> 07:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
option to to suspend it or put them on
 
07:01:02.670 --> 07:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
double secet probation or anything like
 
07:01:05.388 --> 07:01:05.398 align:start position:0%
that versus the other one um if they're
 
07:01:07.150 --> 07:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated they will be incarcerated
 
07:01:09.510 --> 07:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
for seven and a half but it's not a
 
07:01:14.270 --> 07:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:17.110 --> 07:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated representative
 
07:01:20.510 --> 07:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you so is the Assumption
 
07:01:24.150 --> 07:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
here or the hope is that that when the
 
07:01:26.510 --> 07:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
um when a person is considering moving
 
07:01:29.430 --> 07:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
drugs across state lines their knowledge
 
07:01:31.788 --> 07:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
that it's to felonies instead of one
 
07:01:34.708 --> 07:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
will dissuade the behavior the first
 
07:01:36.230 --> 07:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
felony didn't do it but the second one
 
07:01:39.708 --> 07:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:42.110 --> 07:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
Hope representative Roy May respond to
 
07:01:45.670 --> 07:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
that um my no I think the hope is um
 
07:01:48.750 --> 07:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
first of all the mandatory the first one
 
07:01:50.708 --> 07:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
um anyone with any experience in the
 
07:01:53.868 --> 07:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system you see um many
 
07:01:55.230 --> 07:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
times they'll plead in other words
 
07:01:56.910 --> 07:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
you'll arrest somebody with intent to
 
07:02:00.150 --> 07:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
distribute and um uh uh the majority of
 
07:02:01.788 --> 07:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
the time those first few offenses are
 
07:02:03.230 --> 07:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to get pled down to just
 
07:02:06.270 --> 07:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
possession just to dispose of the case
 
07:02:07.868 --> 07:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
so they know that there's a good chance
 
07:02:09.948 --> 07:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to do time on an
 
07:02:11.990 --> 07:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute case unless they
 
07:02:15.990 --> 07:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
have an extensive record this my hope is
 
07:02:17.628 --> 07:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
that they'll say wait a minute if I get
 
07:02:20.948 --> 07:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
caught with this I am doing five years
 
07:02:25.190 --> 07:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
um and that will dissuade them um and
 
07:02:27.150 --> 07:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
and likewise for the vehicle forfeiture
 
07:02:29.910 --> 07:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
as well because a lot of times we see
 
07:02:31.468 --> 07:02:31.478 align:start position:0%
people I don't want to use the word mule
 
07:02:32.830 --> 07:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
but they'll get someone else to drive
 
07:02:34.708 --> 07:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
them because they don't have a car or
 
07:02:36.270 --> 07:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
well that person also might have a
 
07:02:37.590 --> 07:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
second thought to say no I'm not taking
 
07:02:39.548 --> 07:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
you anywhere because we're both going to
 
07:02:42.670 --> 07:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
be five years
 
07:02:45.990 --> 07:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
um as the previous Bill where we reduced
 
07:02:48.110 --> 07:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
the sentence for first offenders uh
 
07:02:50.948 --> 07:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
first time offend simple possession um I
 
07:02:52.190 --> 07:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
think at the same time we have to
 
07:02:53.948 --> 07:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
toughen up on the dealers if we're going
 
07:02:55.990 --> 07:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
to we can't go easy on everyone if we're
 
07:02:57.868 --> 07:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
going to try and give a break and and
 
07:03:00.030 --> 07:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
look more towards Rehabilitation of
 
07:03:02.070 --> 07:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
these these simple offense possess
 
07:03:04.310 --> 07:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
possession offenders we have to at the
 
07:03:06.708 --> 07:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
same time stem the flow otherwise it's
 
07:03:08.350 --> 07:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
just going to be revolving door but
 
07:03:11.590 --> 07:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's my opinion and we did hear
 
07:03:14.868 --> 07:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
a testimony and I I apologize it not on
 
07:03:16.910 --> 07:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill but on a what one of the bills
 
07:03:19.030 --> 07:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
that when you have a penalty of this
 
07:03:22.708 --> 07:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
nature and someone is perhaps stopped or
 
07:03:24.548 --> 07:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
arrested when they're facing a sentence
 
07:03:27.590 --> 07:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
like of that nature is how law
 
07:03:31.670 --> 07:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement often can gather or get
 
07:03:34.910 --> 07:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
informants so that person's facing
 
07:03:37.030 --> 07:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
cooperate or this is what they're going
 
07:03:38.590 --> 07:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
to face so that also gives law
 
07:03:41.708 --> 07:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement more to work with as
 
07:03:43.990 --> 07:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
07:03:47.788 --> 07:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
bden so I'm hearing that if we double up
 
07:03:47.798 --> 07:03:48.788 align:start position:0%
bden so I'm hearing that if we double up
on

07:03:48.788 --> 07:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:03:52.310 --> 07:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
the felonies and take their cars
 
07:03:53.510 --> 07:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
they won't bring the drugs cross the
 
07:03:56.590 --> 07:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
border but when they still do even
 
07:03:58.350 --> 07:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
though they won't when they still do
 
07:04:00.190 --> 07:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
we'll have informance and so those
 
07:04:02.590 --> 07:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
people who violated the law will not be
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
punished so they won't do it but when
 
07:04:08.190 --> 07:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
they still do we won't punish them is is
 
07:04:10.310 --> 07:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm gathering here and it's just
 
07:04:13.468 --> 07:04:13.478 align:start position:0%
very confusing especially considering um
 
07:04:15.510 --> 07:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
what representative Conley mentioned
 
07:04:17.590 --> 07:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
that these people that are arrested for
 
07:04:18.548 --> 07:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
this are
 
07:04:21.788 --> 07:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
typically unwitting drivers probably
 
07:04:23.750 --> 07:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make money for their drug
 
07:04:25.070 --> 07:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
habit and they're not the dealers
 
07:04:26.548 --> 07:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
they're not the kingpins so this doesn't
 
07:04:29.990 --> 07:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
seem to address the kingpins whatsoever
 
07:04:31.868 --> 07:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
and it and I think overall what I seem
 
07:04:33.670 --> 07:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
to be hearing is that this is an
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue really um this is a
 
07:04:40.430 --> 07:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
court issue this isn't a legislative
 
07:04:44.070 --> 07:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
issue so I have concerns that this bill
 
07:04:46.388 --> 07:04:46.398 align:start position:0%
will have the intended
 
07:04:49.190 --> 07:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
effect just to clarify I'm not
 
07:04:51.150 --> 07:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting that a person who violates
 
07:04:53.548 --> 07:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
this law this law will not be punished
 
07:04:55.190 --> 07:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
that is within the that's something that
 
07:04:57.590 --> 07:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
the county attorney or the Attorney
 
07:04:59.910 --> 07:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
General in law enfor that's between
 
07:05:01.628 --> 07:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
that's out of the scope of what we're
 
07:05:03.150 --> 07:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
covering here but that does give law
 
07:05:06.590 --> 07:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement another tool in the overall
 
07:05:08.388 --> 07:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
uh fight against the drugs that they're
 
07:05:08.398 --> 07:05:11.788 align:start position:0%
uh fight against the drugs that they're
dealing

07:05:11.788 --> 07:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:16.150 --> 07:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
with representative cly knight uh thank
 
07:05:18.628 --> 07:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
you chair um
 
07:05:24.070 --> 07:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
I is there any sort of data involving
 
07:05:26.868 --> 07:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
how this may have impacted another state
 
07:05:29.110 --> 07:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
or another state has adopted this
 
07:05:31.310 --> 07:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
language and how it has affected their
 
07:05:31.320 --> 07:05:36.990 align:start position:0%
language and how it has affected their
prison

07:05:36.990 --> 07:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:40.030 --> 07:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
population I I can um I can tell you
 
07:05:41.948 --> 07:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
that there are many States including
 
07:05:44.388 --> 07:05:44.398 align:start position:0%
California Florida Texas that have
 
07:05:48.110 --> 07:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
adopted this I can't speak to how that
 
07:05:50.230 --> 07:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
would require really an in-depth study
 
07:05:52.430 --> 07:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to isol out laid out what
 
07:05:54.948 --> 07:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
exactly affected the population or not
 
07:05:56.750 --> 07:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
or and how but I can tell you there are
 
07:05:59.468 --> 07:05:59.478 align:start position:0%
other states that have
 
07:06:02.310 --> 07:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
it we still have a follow follow up
 
07:06:05.830 --> 07:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all with due respect to the
 
07:06:09.070 --> 07:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill and the the sponsor um do we have
 
07:06:10.788 --> 07:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
to exec today or is there more research
 
07:06:20.590 --> 07:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:23.628 --> 07:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
do I think we've had a plenty discussion
 
07:06:23.638 --> 07:06:25.190 align:start position:0%
do I think we've had a plenty discussion
on

07:06:25.190 --> 07:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:06:28.388 --> 07:06:28.398 align:start position:0%
it so at this point I think we
 
07:06:28.398 --> 07:06:45.510 align:start position:0%
it so at this point I think we
represented

07:06:45.510 --> 07:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:48.190 --> 07:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
panus my understanding this is this yes
 
07:06:50.310 --> 07:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's targeting individuals who are
 
07:06:52.468 --> 07:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
importing drugs with the intent to
 
07:06:54.190 --> 07:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
distribute those drugs in the state of
 
07:06:56.948 --> 07:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so those drugs in all
 
07:06:59.310 --> 07:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
likelihood are not manufactured or
 
07:07:01.430 --> 07:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
cultivated or whatever in this state
 
07:07:02.868 --> 07:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
they're brought in this state and this
 
07:07:05.230 --> 07:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
is an additional penalty in addition to
 
07:07:07.510 --> 07:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to
 
07:07:10.350 --> 07:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
distribute at this at this point unless
 
07:07:12.110 --> 07:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
you if you have not spoke already I
 
07:07:18.990 --> 07:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:21.910 --> 07:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
question if if you in if you in support
 
07:07:23.948 --> 07:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
of point of order Mr chairman you
 
07:07:26.110 --> 07:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
recognized for your point of order um
 
07:07:27.670 --> 07:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that we can't move
 
07:07:28.948 --> 07:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
the questioning committee that that's
 
07:07:31.670 --> 07:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
only a motion for the floor is that
 
07:07:34.070 --> 07:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's true but he can vote
 
07:07:35.548 --> 07:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
whenever he
 
07:07:39.030 --> 07:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
wants I I believe are you believing that
 
07:07:41.430 --> 07:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm what rule am I not following I don't
 
07:07:44.070 --> 07:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
follow there can't be a motion for me to
 
07:07:45.708 --> 07:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
for the chair to move the question but
 
07:07:47.548 --> 07:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
the chair has the discretion to move the
 
07:07:50.310 --> 07:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
the question at their own discretion so
 
07:07:51.750 --> 07:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
as a chair of the committee I'm moving
 
07:07:53.910 --> 07:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
the question is this not a deliberative
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
body where we
 
07:07:59.788 --> 07:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
deliberate I'm I'm not following what
 
07:08:01.910 --> 07:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
you asked a question about H what
 
07:08:03.310 --> 07:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
discretion I have to move the question I
 
07:08:06.430 --> 07:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
just answered your question so I I'm not
 
07:08:07.590 --> 07:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to overrule your
 
07:08:08.350 --> 07:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
point of
 
07:08:10.830 --> 07:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
order this point at this time the matter
 
07:08:12.430 --> 07:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
will now be put to question if you in
 
07:08:14.548 --> 07:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
support of the motion of ought to pass
 
07:08:16.948 --> 07:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
