00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
stay off go ahead
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
um so 20 22 91 the only comment on this
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
proposal was that the rules expired on
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
November 23 2021 and
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
therefore the rules have been expired
 
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
for almost a year now there are some
 
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
fees within the rule however those fees
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
are statutory fees and set by Statute
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
which is how the department has
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
Justified collecting those fees while
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
the rules have been expired
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
the remaining part of the rules are for
 
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 align:start position:0%
the application for certain
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
certifications and licensures
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
um that also accompany some forms that
 
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:37.099 align:start position:0%
have all been submitted to staff and a
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
conditional approval was submitted that
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
addressed the remaining substantive
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
comments that staff had
 
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
comments that staff had
foreign

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say um that the rules
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
as presented for conditional approval
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
have been in place for for 10 years
 
00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
there was one minor section that was
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
deleted based on a statutory change
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
um but the rules represent the process
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
for what is authorized in statute that
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
is the registration of aircraft
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
commercial operators and aircraft
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
dealers and all the fees are set in
 
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.610 align:start position:0%
dealers and all the fees are set in
statute

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
um the other changes are tweaks that
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
were recommended by the office of
 
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:24.620 align:start position:0%
legislative Services rules Division
 
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
and the incorporation of the forms by
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
reference at this point I would really
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
like to thank the folks at OLS rules
 
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:34.700 align:start position:0%
division their knowledge and assistance
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
rulemaking I'll admit is not my forte
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
and they are most helpful and I really
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:48.530 align:start position:0%

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
um and we include the waiver
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh for this particular rule there was a
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection that was tabled at
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
the last meeting so that is still being
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
considered at this time however the
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
agency has submitted an amended
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request as was
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
discussed making changes to the
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
religious exemption form and the
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
religious exemption rules taking out the
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment pieces on the form and in
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
the rule and additionally on the form
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
making the
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
section where the
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
person applying for the waiver can
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
select the vaccine making that optional
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
and even putting a disclosure underneath
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
that that if it is not provided it will
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
not impact the request for the religious
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
exemption which based on the minutes and
 
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
the notes taken at the last meeting were
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
the two changes that were being
 
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.590 align:start position:0%
the two changes that were being
discussed

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
so all the committee requests
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
complied with
 
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
um as far as I'm aware and I was
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
informed by the agency that
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lang had been in contact
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
with the agency as well to discuss those
 
00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:58.069 align:start position:0%
with the agency as well to discuss those
changes

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
um so I wasn't sure if there was going
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
to be additional testimony with regard
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
Mr Cham I'm gonna withdraw my uh
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
objection at this point and leave it
 
00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:08.459 align:start position:0%
open for another motion to give the
 
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%

see no further discussion all those in

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
all right this is a Bea rule on the
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
Broadband managing matching Grant
 
00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.250 align:start position:0%
Broadband managing matching Grant
initiative

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
um it's an interim role because the
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
statute just changed and I apologize
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
this was actually Kim's rule so I'm I'm
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
not quite up to speed
 
00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339 align:start position:0%
um there are several Clarity and
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
legislative intent questions
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and I I think many of them I actually
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
just saw one that we could remove
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and then there are some more that
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
that probably need to be clarified
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
most of the comments deal with the
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
different forms and what information
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
needs to go on the forums some of them
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
deal with Federal guidance and federal
 
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
language that's not entirely clear
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
um and so your deadline is not until the
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
23rd you could postpone this or you
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
could do a preliminary objection
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
um well let's you all keep working on
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
