the procedures page so something that
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
this committee has done for a long
 
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
period of time is to um suggest to
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
agencies what the commission rate should
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
be if they um have property sold and um
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
what the final sale can go below 10%
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
can't go below 10% of what the uh asking
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
price was that they presented to this
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
committee um as well as the procedural
 
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
aspects of providing information to our
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
office to get on this agenda and if it's
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
a late item to ask for the committee's
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh the chair of the committee's
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
permission to do so um again the
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
information that you ask related to the
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
commission and the pricing is more
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
informational that helps you make the
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
decision on whether to dispose of
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
property this committee's charge is to
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
do an up or down vote on um allowing the
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
property to be sold or leased um not to
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
set the the actual dollar to it so if
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
the committee is okay with that I think
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
you just would want to get an
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
affirmative action on that and then the
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
um item 25-1 is just the statutes that
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
um you might see as a result of sitting
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
on this committee when items come
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
forward and and the organization of the
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%

5.66 acres of land at the burgal Berlin
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
the runway it is also a buts um what's
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
the road there East Side River Road in
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
Island uh currently the the land is
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
largely undeveloped uh however there are
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
um I believe there's at least one snile

Trail Crossing it or around it and then

building on site uh this is as I
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
understand it somewhat similar in con up
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
to what currently exists at conquered
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
airport but on a smaller scale
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
um you have anything to
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
add good morning Mr Mr chair committee
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
members um for the record I'm David mtis
 
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
the agent general of New Hampshire
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
National Guard all right so what are we
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do um we're trying to build a
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
hanger to save lives and so in federal
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 we received
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
approximately 5.5 million to build a
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
through a congressionally directed
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
spending project to build a hanger up in
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
the Berlin area airport in the town of M
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
and so it's a very small scale it will
 
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
have zero full-time presence and what
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
it'll allow us to do is to conduct
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
training in the white modern National
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
Force and to help ourselves with fishing
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
games save lives through search and
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
rescue operations so it's going to be a
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
no permanent Manning a hanger facility
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
potentially with a small administrative
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
section depending on you know how the
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
construction dollars come out and
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
there's some PE peculiar things about
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
this you know one of it is like why a
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
dollar a year for 50 years the reason
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
why is there's two reasons one is the
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense is exempt from FAA
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
fair market value rates at uh airports
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
right so you go to the FAA regulation
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
their compliance rules and you say it's
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay as long as the Department of
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
Defense has a flying Mission you're
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
exempt from fair market value the second
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
thing is when we receive what's called
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
military construction dollars from uh
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
the president's budget we have to show
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
ownership for a minimum of 25 to 30
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
years so right so you have dollar year
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
at lease for 50 years and that's the
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
reason why like I said for the full-time
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
presence there will be zero full-time
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
presence there what we're trying to do
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
is just help our Airmen train our our
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
our Pilots because next year they're
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
deploying to Kosovo for United Nations
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
peacekeeping Mission so every 3 to four
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
years our helicopter units deploy and
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
because of the size of the training area
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
in the white modern National Forest
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
having a pre-positioned hanger that's
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
available in the event a helicopter
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
breaks in the event we have to Stage
 
00:14:58.509 --> 00:14:58.519 align:start position:0%
something up there for search and rescue
 
00:14:58.519 --> 00:14:59.550 align:start position:0%
something up there for search and rescue
operations

00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
it just increases the value and
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to train our soldiers
 
00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:03.949 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to train our soldiers
and

00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
Airmen any questions comments Senator
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
Lang move to approve I'll second motion
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
has been made and
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
seconded all those in favor say I I
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
carries if I may Mr chair um I did want
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
to add one thing to the record when we
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
when we submitted this item uh the the
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
maximum lease term was 55 years uh on
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
Friday we learned that the Federal
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
Aviation Administration objects to any
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
lease longer than 50 years at this
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
airport so we have revised that so it's
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
now 50 years is the maximum lease term
 
00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:42.030 align:start position:0%
now 50 years is the maximum lease term
not

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
Shay I think we're fine it's on the
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%

autopsies this year alone they're on
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
course to uh conduct about 750 autopsies
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't own any building or
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
facilities that are capable of
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
conducting autopsies or storing bodies
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
pending autopsies so for the past 39
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
years plus minus we've been leasing
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
office space from conquered hospital at
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
250 Pleasant Street the um Office Park
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the main hospital and then
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
paying a separate fee for every time
 
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
that the medical examiner uses the morg
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
to conduct an
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
autopsy that lease and that Arrangement
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
are due to expire next year and the
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
hospital's made clear that we're not
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
going to be able to continue on the same
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
terms that we've had in years past
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
they'd like to make other uses for the
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
offices that the medical examiner
 
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
offices that the medical examiner
currently

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
occupies um for for their own purposes
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
and the morg that the medical examiners
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
using that they're sharing with the
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
hospital is getting to be inadequate
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
over the year with the number of cases
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
they do going up with the addition of a
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
third medical examiner with their body
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
storage at capacity in fact Dr dval can
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
talk about uh some uh present day
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
examples of that but they're exceeding
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
the capacity to store bodies there at
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
the hospital and the more in the
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
basement of hospital is a footprint that
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
can't be expanded so we've had
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with the hospital they've
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
identified another location just up the
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
road at 279 Pleasant Street and they're
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
willing to build out and fit out the
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
first floor of that building to
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
accommodate the medical examiner offices
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
an autopsy suite for three doctors and
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
body storage morg for basically double
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
the capacity that the medical examiners
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
have now so we're asking the committee's
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
permission to proceed with the lease
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
along the terms that were laid out in a
 
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:42.039 align:start position:0%
letter of intent the party signed at the
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
end of last year and it would be over a
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
term of 30 years the hospital would
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
build out as I say and equip the
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
facility for the exclusive use of the
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
medical examiner for its offices morg
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
and autopsy Suites so we're available to
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee might
 
00:19:58.039 --> 00:19:59.909 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee might
have

00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%

matter Senator Pearl so just quickly

looking through this thanks for coming
 
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
in today by the way there at least one
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
of these lots that is not doesn't appear
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
like it's large enough to build so
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking to list the Lots
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
individually and then as a group cluster
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
or is there any thought towards selling
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
maybe combining a couple of them to make
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
them if they're substandard to make them
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%

00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
both relatively small one is a temporary
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
construction easement along the existing

in
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro um and then the other one and
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
strip of land basically allowing uh
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
access to um the project which is a
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
sidewalk project uh and being conducted
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
by the town of Hillsboro as I understand
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
it in partnership with
 
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.309 align:start position:0%

years uh maximum expiration term of two
 
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
