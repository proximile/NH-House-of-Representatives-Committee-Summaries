00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 align:start position:0%
and uh members of the committee good
 
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
morning as well I'm Senator David Waters
 
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh District Four to introduce some
 
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh 14 relative to the use of game
 
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.309 align:start position:0%
uh 14 relative to the use of game
cameras

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
um I will very briefly uh present what
 
00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
are the actual
 
00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.750 align:start position:0%
are the actual
um

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
parts of the legislation are as amended
 
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
by the the house and then talk a little
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
bit about some of the background of the
 
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill and then we have lots of folks here
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
from Fish and Game and Timberland
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
Association uh Owners Association and
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
others as well
 
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
um what this bill tries to get at is the
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
balancing of the use of game cameras and
 
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh privacy rights and so the work that
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
has been done in this in the Senate and
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
in the house I think we're into five or
 
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
six years working on this since the
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
technology has arisen and tried and
 
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
gotten kind of close in many bills and I
 
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
think we thought we gotta we got pretty
 
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
pretty good job done in the Senate I
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
think the Bill's been improved in the
 
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
houses as well
 
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
um so what you have here are some
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
definitions of what a game camera is and
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
a technology that's involved
 
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
um with it and uh then the provisions
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
about when they are able to be used for
 
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
hunting per minimum or fur bearing
 
00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:54.590 align:start position:0%
hunting per minimum or fur bearing
animal

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
animal
 
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
um how they
 
00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
you can locate them use them and then
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions on house soon after they've
 
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
taken an image that they can go out and
 
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
do their their hunt which makes some
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
good sense there and then it turns to
 
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
the property owner rights and it talks
 
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
the property owner rights and it talks
about

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
we've got any permission we went back
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
and forth a lot about how the commission
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
were given did anybody given so on and
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
so forth and uh so now we have the
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
language here about getting the
 
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
permission or someone can post their
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
land to say
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the use is permitted on these lands
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and uh then
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
as we have with tree stands and other
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
things there's a date by which they
 
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
ought to be removed every year uh unless
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
the owner has explicitly allowed it to
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
to stay on past the December 30 31st and
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
then since the game cameras are actually
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
the property of the person who places it
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
and the somebody who sees one and says I
 
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
don't want that camera in my tree and
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
you know takes it out there actually I'm
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
removing or damaging potentially
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
somebody's properties so that that's why
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
the procedure needs to be in here that
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
um that someone who's able to take that
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
camera down can be informed to come out
 
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
and take it out of the out of the woods
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the um a property owner and then you
 
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
see some Provisions here for uh use of
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
them in research and then for law
 
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities as as well
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's what the bill tries
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
to do but let me go back a little bit to
 
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
the kind of balancing of issues here uh
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
um as I I think back
 
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn to common law and
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
you know Robin Hood was pretty didn't
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
have Robin who didn't have game cameras
 
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
but he was sure concerned about Open
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
Access of of public lands and that is so
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
deeply rooted in common law in our
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
traditions in this state
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
um and so how do we balance out the
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
right of Rights of public access to land
 
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 align:start position:0%
with the rights of the property owners
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh to privacy and to regulate what
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
goes on on on their land now um you know
 
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
what makes this so such an important
 
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
issue is that we need to get this right
 
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
because as they are being used and as
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
the technology of course uh improves and
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
increases um people are concerned about
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
their privacy and if we don't
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
provide a system here that works for
 
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
private land owners they are going to
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
post their land just to no trespassing
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
and no hunting and for those of us you
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
know I was on fish and game when I was
 
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
in the house and I wanted to Natural
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
Resources if we're going to make sure
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
the hunting can continue in our state we
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that this this good
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
balance is there so that people will
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
keep their land open and you know the
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
worst result would be for large
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
landowners particularly coming in from
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
out of state buying large amounts of
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
land and not familiar with the culture
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
of Open Access and hunting will just by
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
default post all their property there's
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
some of that going on so this is why you
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
know land owners Timberland Owners
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
Association Fish and Game have worked so
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
hard over many years now and why they
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
asked me to bring this bill forward in
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
the in the Senate so um very glad to
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
answer some questions but we have a lot
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
of people who also want to talk about as
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
any questions for Senator Waters
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.180 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters someone asked
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony Senator
 
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
Waters um I just have a question about
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and it the the requirement that no
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
person shall take the game animal a fur
 
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:55.019 align:start position:0%
bearing animal within the same calendar
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
day of remotely viewing that that image
 
00:08:59.930 --> 00:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
how is there how does how is that
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
enforced or how
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
what's the expectation for I mean I get
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
the rationale for it but how would you
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that that doesn't happen well I'm
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to let the official game folks um
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
just speak to that but there is some
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement around around that and um
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's something that we
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
that you know has has been has been a
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
concern and uh questions of fair hunt
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think that I I again I'm gonna
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
let fishing game but I do believe we
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
have some Provisions that are similar to
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
this relating to the issue of baiting as
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I'll let them speak to that okay
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you enforcement side
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
and representative Murphy just based on
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
my knowledge the
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
the camera will actually put a date time
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
stamp when it sends a picture as well as
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
the cell phone itself will show when it
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
came in so it is absolutely provable
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
when it was sent to when it was received
 
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
and if they happen to be there when you
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
harvest it they can put it together it's
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
a matter of some math and looking at the
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
two devices but I'm sure they'll expound
 
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:06.740 align:start position:0%
in that way thank you Mr chairman yeah
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh with that the chair recognizes
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:39.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:49.579 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the Senate Bill 14.
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
Mark and I are the owners of 500 Acres
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
next to the guile State Forest our land
 
00:10:58.449 --> 00:10:58.459 align:start position:0%
is not posted
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
we have been named the New Hampshire
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
Tree Farm of the year for 2022 in
 
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:06.740 align:start position:0%
recognition of our
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
significant wildlife habitat management
 
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
we've had five moose taken on the
 
00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:16.339 align:start position:0%
property since 2004.
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
we facilitate Hunters on our property we
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
have allowed game cameras to be used in
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
two instances with written permission
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
and we knew exactly where the cameras
 
00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:30.730 align:start position:0%
and we knew exactly where the cameras
were

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:30.740 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
of but we do not want to have people
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
come onto our property without
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
permission and Place game cameras or
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
tree stands for that matter on our
 
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
property without knowing where they are
 
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
we have 10 miles of trails that are
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
managed and are
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
used frequently by the public
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
and we feel that it would be an invasion
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
of our privacy and of the other folks
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
who use our land
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
if a game camera were set up anywhere
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
near these trails
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
um our other concern is that we actively
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
manage our property we've had four
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
Timber harvests since 2004 we are
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
planning a Timber Harvest this year or
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
next year that's always dependent on
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
ground conditions and uh so if there
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
were game cameras on the property or
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
tree stands on the property and we
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
didn't know where they were then they
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
could be taken down with the timber
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
Harvest or damaged and we would prefer
 
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
not to have that happen to the owners of
 
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:44.180 align:start position:0%
that equipment
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions but we know we're
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to keep our comments short so
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
um while I appreciate pithiness if
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's anything else you want to add go
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
ahead I I just had one real quick thing
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
I we retired to New Hampshire
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
20 years ago or so
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons we did one of the
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
big reasons we did is because we were so
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
pleased that we could meet in a
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
situation like this we're came from
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
Chicago where you had to put a hundred
 
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
dollars on the table just to get the to
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
talk to you to talk to your Alderman so
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
that's that's our whole year's salary
 
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
yes we know that we know that but I I
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
just want to say that it and I and I I
 
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too excited but it's
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
my land my land and zland and one of the
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
nice things about New Hampshire is your
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
land is your land
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
and it isn't belong to somebody else and
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
you can't be told
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
without the common law I heard the word
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
common law which is true and good but
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
it's my land yeah
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
um we we love having people uh use our
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
property including Hunters we've had uh
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
a wonderful relationships with the
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
hunters who have used our property they
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
we have found them to be knowledgeable
 
00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.650 align:start position:0%
we have found them to be knowledgeable
respectful

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
respectful
 
00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:12.019 align:start position:0%
um and that's probably 99
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
of the folks who come on to our land one
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that we bought the land
 
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:21.380 align:start position:0%
next to the guile State Forest
 
00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:23.779 align:start position:0%
was to
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
enhance uh the opportunities for the
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
public to use this land in perpetuity
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
and we have taken the expense and the
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
steps to place the conservation easement
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
on the property
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it will not become a
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
Walmart parking lot or a Housing
 
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.449 align:start position:0%
Walmart parking lot or a Housing
Development

00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:46.459 align:start position:0%
Development
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
and it is we're prejudiced but we think
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful piece of land
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
and one of the other things that we've
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
done we know that our management has
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
benefited while life but this year
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
through 2026 we have hired Wildlife
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
biologists to survey the animals and
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
plants on the property uh
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
before a Timber Harvest and then after a
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
Timber Harvest to determine whether in
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
fact our Timber management is beneficial
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
to the plant and animal species on the
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
land so we're serious about
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
providing this as a public resource and
 
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
documenting it and sharing that
 
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.670 align:start position:0%
documenting it and sharing that
information

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
with others who might find it beneficial
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
but we do feel strongly about
 
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
knowing if people have game cameras on
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
um for your testimony and your sharing
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
of your property if I may ask if these
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
two bills pass is it your intention to
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
continue on allowing your property to be
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
shared in the way that you have
 
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.060 align:start position:0%
um our our conservation easement
 
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:04.820 align:start position:0%
requires that the land
 
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:08.420 align:start position:0%
be continued to be open to hunting
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
however we will put up signs that say uh
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
permission written permission is
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
required for tree stands and game
 
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.670 align:start position:0%
required for tree stands and game
cameras

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
that would be within the provisions of
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
our conservation easement
 
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions to these
 
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.449 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions to these
Witnesses

I'm here to ask you to pass game camera
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
build Senate bill 14.
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
I own several Parcels of land in Orford
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
weather I'm often out on the properties
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
either a friend or my family and that
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%

one of the issues that I would like to
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
raise is that I don't want to worry
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
about where there might be a camera when
 
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:48.260 align:start position:0%
I or one of my grandchildren or friends
 
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
needs to take a bathroom break
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
that's not a time when we should have to
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
worry about where the cameras are
 
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.110 align:start position:0%
worry about where the cameras are
located

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
located
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
please think about my privacy
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
I own the property
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
the landowner needs to be asked so that
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
we know where any cameras are located
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
please pass this bill
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for having both Sheila and

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
in Orford and Wentworth and manage it as
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
a sustainable Forest I have owned Forest
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
land for over 66 years and have been a
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
advocate for several for many years of
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
opening and sharing our forest land with
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
both the state of New Hampshire and the
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
General Public
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
we have over 12 miles of wood roads and
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
skid trails that we allow the snowmobile
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
clubs to use
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
we open our land for many other
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
activities for foot traffic such as
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
hunting hiking
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
along with many tours that we give each
 
00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:26.990 align:start position:0%
along with many tours that we give each
year

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
I support Senate bill 14 relative to the
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
U.S use of game cameras and Senate Bill
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
15 relative to the use of tree stands
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
and observation blinds as written in
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
these bills and recently both bills were
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
passed by the Full House and Senate
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
this is a privacy issue for our family
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
as a forest landowner and tree farmer I
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
can tell you many other tree Farmers
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire feel the same
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
as we do
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
we have many special spots on our
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
property that we have family gatherings
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
or tours and last thing we need to worry
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
about is someone that has placed a
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
camera without permission and has the
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
latest technology and plays it back
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
in real time on a cell phone which can
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
be put on social media within minutes
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
we as landowners should not have to
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
worry about what we are doing and saying
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
on our own property
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
I watched the latest video of the
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
hearing on April 4th on these two Senate
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
bills in fish and game and Marine
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
resource committee
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
and was shocked when I heard a member of
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
this committee say and I'm paraphrasing
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
that no landowner should have the
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
expectations of privacy on his land
 
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
it's this kind of statement from a
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
public official that will drive private
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
landowners to post their lands
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.930 --> 00:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
as a landowner who has purchased my
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
first woodlot 125 Acres when I was six
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
years when I was 11 years old
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
and for the last 66 years I have shared
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
that woodlot and many other wood Lots
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
over the years I have enjoyed the many
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
folks who have given us the courtesy of
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
asking permission to hunt Place game
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
cameras and Dr Sands on our property and
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
we also appreciate the many calls and
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
cards Thanking us for sharing our lands
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
it's this kind of attitude that will
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
keep New Hampshire private lands open
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
as of today I have testified four times
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
this year just in support of these bills
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
as written and passed by the Senate and
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
recently by the full house but for some
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
reason it has been referred to criminal
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety Committee
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
please pass the bills as they were
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
passed by the Full House
 
00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
in these Bill if these bills fail to
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
pass and do not become law to protect
 
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:00.140 align:start position:0%
the privacy of our private lands our
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
2400 Acres will be posted for the first
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
time in 66 years
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
I can assure you many more thousands of
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
acres in New Hampshire will also be
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
posted because the New Hampshire
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
legislature ignored the Privacy rights
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
of our New Hampshire landowners
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
who in the past have been willing to
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
share our lands with the general public
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
consideration on this important issue
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
for all New Hampshire private Forest
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
one other thing I would like to add is
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire major landowner
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%

chairman thank you uh for your testimony
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
just for clarification it was referred
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
to this committee because it does
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
provide a penalty and anytime a bill
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
provides a penalty by law the criminal
 
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
justice committee hears it because it's
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
a criminal justice issue that's the only
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
reason that it was referred to this
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
committee does anyone else have any
 
00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:17.510 align:start position:0%

listening and taking this bill very
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
seriously I normally come and sort of
 
00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:05.419 align:start position:0%
wing it so to speak
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
but this is a not only a very important
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
issue for
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%

Fish and Game the commission uh
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
providing Public Access is actually one
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
of our duties charged to us under RSA
 
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.330 align:start position:0%
of our duties charged to us under RSA
2064a

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
2064a
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
and the key to both the creation of the
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
commission is that we are the citizen
 
00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:34.850 align:start position:0%
commission is that we are the citizen
Representatives

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
and under item three one of our duties
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
is to ensure public access to private
 
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.770 align:start position:0%
is to ensure public access to private

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
land
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
for recreational use
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's not for hunting use it's not for
 
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
fishing use trapping it's for all
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
recreational use so we want to stress
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
that this is not just about hunters
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
using Game consists to public land for I
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
mean private land for the public
 
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.029 align:start position:0%
mean private land for the public
um

00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
so we take this so seriously that we
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually have a program at the
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
department that is dedicated to
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
landowner relations we provide signs we
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
provide Personnel to go out to talk to
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
people that have large tracts of land I
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
per Commissioners reach out I've done
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
this uh recently in Carroll County where
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
we had some people such as the senator
 
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
spoke of that moved in and immediately
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
posted 200 acres of land that had never
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
been posted in in the town before and we
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
were able I was able to speak with them
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
and get it unposted so we take this the
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
these relationships with the private
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
landowner very seriously at Fish and
 
00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.810 align:start position:0%

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
Game
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe anyone has spoken of
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
the percentage of private land in the
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
state but it's at the 76 percent level
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
so for us to provide Public Access
 
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
maintaining these landowner
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
relationships and respecting private
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
property rights are very important and
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
this does bring in the constitutional
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
right under article 2B of the New
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution to a right to
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
privacy nowhere in our constitution is a
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
guaranteed of public access to private
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
land to which you have no legal standing
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
to be on this is about the generosity of
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
private landowners you've heard prior
 
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:37.580 align:start position:0%
testimony from two couples
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we just have worked very hard on
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
this bill the last several years with
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders and we feel like we've
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
gotten it right this time and we would
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate criminal Justice's
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
support and this can move to the
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
governor's desk I'll be glad to take any
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have one question on section
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
four Roman numeral four of the proposed
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill it says a property owner shall
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
contact us uh a local or state law
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer conservation officer
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
and sees a game camera which was placed
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
in violation of this section is it you
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
are understanding that that means that's
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
what you have to do in other words if I
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
own land
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
and somebody has without my permission
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
posted a game camera
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
do I have to call Fish and Game or can I
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
just go out and take the camera down
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to defer to the colonel
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
when he comes up because he deals with
 
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
us and the officers deal with this all
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
the time and Senator Waters spoke to
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
this in his initial testimony some of
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
these game cams are attached to trees
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
with cables so there is an issue of
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
damaging someone's property that's been
 
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
placed on your property and so to create
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
to minimize that conflict most
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
landowners will currently call the
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
department for assistance but I'll defer
 
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:12.980 align:start position:0%
to the kernel in more pragmatic matters
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
with that situation thanks
 
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:18.620 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Jeff
 
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.370 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes Jeff
Eames

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
Eames
 
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:33.380 align:start position:0%

things
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
I'm here to ask the committee to pass
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
the bill as a House and Senate who
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
written it and why
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'm in forestry business every day we
 
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
have employees which is 13 Going to the
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
woods except for the truck drivers
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
every day we find a different camera a
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
different tree stand
 
00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.110 align:start position:0%
different tree stand
and

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
we got to remove those we just can't
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
work in an environment with tree stands
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
and cameras
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
and we somewhat feel of a certain
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility to contact that person
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
who owns it to give it to them
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
the landowner assistance program has
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
done things like taking pictures of
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
cameras and put them on Facebook to find
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
a rightful owner and it becomes a horror
 
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.889 align:start position:0%
a rightful owner and it becomes a horror
show

00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
show
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
all the dialogue that goes on with that
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
Facebook stuff whether it's login
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
you know changing of the land
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
it's not fun and all we'd like to do is
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
return that product to its rightful
 
00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.649 align:start position:0%
return that product to its rightful
owner

00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
state of Michigan concludes that 47
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
percent of hunters today use game
 
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
cameras you take that factor and put it
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
that's over 50 000 cameras out there
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
every day like I said myself in the
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
forestry team are in the woods making
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
decisions helping landowners manage
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
their property
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I got involved with this business
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
40 years ago
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
since then the clients that we have have
 
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.350 align:start position:0%
since then the clients that we have have
changed

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
their property is not just a wood lot
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
anymore they take a lot of Pride and
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
ownership they practice all kinds of
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
different diverse management whether
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's Wildlife Management whether it's
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
water quality whether it's forestry
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's Recreation and we've
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
adapted the change with them but however
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
it's not just the woodlot anymore it's
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
someone's personal property and I can
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
tell you that they get very offended
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
when they find game cameras and tree
 
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
stands on their property
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
and one of the first things that they do
 
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
dealing with game cameras it's a problem
 
00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:35.210 align:start position:0%
dealing with game cameras it's a problem
personally

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
personally
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
I've been threatened
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
okay I'm on a job someone shows up and
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
said hey you took my tree stand you took
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
my camera I didn't take it
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
yeah you better watch your back Eames
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
your equipment's gonna burn
 
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.470 align:start position:0%
your equipment's gonna burn
what

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
this morning I met with Scott Ralph he's
 
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
a Forester managing land for the State
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the regional manager
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I said what do you think about this
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
oh man he says you know how much time I
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
spend on trying to find the owners of
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
I guess as a taxpayer do I really want
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
someone interrupting his daily
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
activities to go find the owner of
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
treason tree stands and game cameras
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
they are known as like Manchester
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
Waterworks are so frustrated with it
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
that they have come up with their own
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
policy and I encourage you if I can
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
leave this with you
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
hunting permit required they own about 8
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
000 Acres right around Manchester New
 
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.190 align:start position:0%
000 Acres right around Manchester New
Hampshire

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's a big land base for recreational
 
00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
for our biggest component of Manchester
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
and vicinity
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
they're so frustrated with it that they
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
came up with their own policy regarding
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
tree stands nothing to do with game
 
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
tree stands nothing to do with game
cameras

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to introduce this I only
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
brought one copy
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
um for the board for their committee to
 
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.289 align:start position:0%
um for the board for their committee to
review

00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I guess with that in mind
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
I feel a lot more comfortable when being
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
in the woods and I do in this committee
 
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I'm happy to
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead and representative renewal
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
coming in and talking to us today I just
 
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask really quickly especially
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
um in the event that someone is trying
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
to return the property
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
um the landowner finds something and
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
wants to return it this bill provides
 
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
for obviously having the information
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
providing for permission and things like
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
that is it your contention that as the
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned before that
 
00:33:30.779 --> 00:33:32.210 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned before that
having

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
um uh fishing games so contacting a
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
local or state law enforcement officer
 
00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:40.019 align:start position:0%
or conference conservation officer would
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
reduce the risk of having that
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
interaction like you were describing
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
where it was contentious and and um
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
trouble between the landowner and the
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
owner of the property
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely if there was some chain
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
of custody to what that was going on out
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
there it would eliminate the negative
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
activity or actions of the
 
00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
tristanona or the game camera
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman can I give this deal Yes
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
actually if you on the way out if you
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
could hand it to our assistant she'll
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
make copies for the whole committee
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair recognizes
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
I discovered in the last few months I
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
have a real hearing problem
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
in a situation like this so thank you
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
for your patience
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
uh I am Walter Lacy
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
from keen and my wife and I own 650
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
acres of land in Keene Swansea and
 
00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:54.290 align:start position:0%
acres of land in Keene Swansea and
Chesterfield

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
Chesterfield
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
although not a hunter myself I believe
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
very strongly in con traditional uses of
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
the land and hunting is certainly one of
 
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.170 align:start position:0%
the land and hunting is certainly one of
them

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
our land has always been open to hunting
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
and trapping I can't imagine that
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
changing that being said said I've had a
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
problem with tree stands over the years
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
twice with Associated game cameras
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
in two instances healthy valuable oak
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
trees were damaged
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
none of the stands or camera said
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
contact information on them and all my
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
efforts to communicate with the owners
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
by leaving my contact information on
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
flagging tape was unsuccessful
 
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339 align:start position:0%
in the most recent incident because of
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
the nature of the camera involved a fish
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
and game officer was able to identify
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
the offender
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
the mutual benefits of having contact
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
information on this equipment seem
 
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.390 align:start position:0%
information on this equipment seem
undeniable

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
undeniable
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
a simple phone call could clear up any
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
question a landowner might have and 100
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
might get back a misplaced stand or
 
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.650 align:start position:0%
might get back a misplaced stand or
camera

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
the increasing use and sophistication of
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
game cameras should require permission
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
for the use on private land
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
the idea that something is allowed in my
 
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.589 align:start position:0%
the idea that something is allowed in my
backyard

00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
but not yours is unacceptable
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
it all seems to me a matter of common
 
00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:16.970 align:start position:0%
it all seems to me a matter of common
courtesy

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
courtesy
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
if you want to leave a piece of gear on
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
someone else's land you get permission
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
put your name on it
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
what could be simpler than that
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
I don't like to see land posted I think
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
it's a short-sighted measure
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
if the common sense requirements of SB
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
14 and 15 are not enacted however
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid land owners may be left with
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
no other choice
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
with privileges come some
 
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.109 align:start position:0%
with privileges come some
responsibilities

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:47.660 align:start position:0%
and I have to add one of the greatest
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
rewards of owning land is being able to
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
share it
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
so I hope we can
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
get these issues cleared up thank you
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
any questions for the win sorry
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:37:23.339 --> 00:37:24.829 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

committee
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
I submitted um by email a letter
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
to the chair on I guess it was Sunday
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
evening May 14th
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
so that that letter I'll just kind of
 
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
read a few things from it
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
but record I'm Mark ledgard I've lived

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
went out there and were hunting left
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
trash and did some damage to my land so
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything against anybody
 
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.490 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything against anybody
hunting

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
um because I'm an avid Hunter myself I
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that when people
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
are on my land I know what they're doing
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
um so I don't see this bill I agree with
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill 14 and 15. I see it
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
actually as protecting our hunting
 
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:32.900 align:start position:0%
Heritage because it's putting the
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
landowner private land owner
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
having some say in what they do which is
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
basically what we want to do
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and it's going to preserve a hunting
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
Heritage I've seen a lot of land being
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
posted as other people have testified
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
today and here I am trying to Mentor
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
some young Hunters older hunters and and
 
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
the land is getting posted I'm having a
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
hard time finding places for them to go
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
to and Hunt where you know they can feel
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable out there so I think
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and I do talk to land owners when I
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
go to hunt on their property I generally
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't put tree stands out there or
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
cameras but I do on my own property but
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
I ask for permission to hunt even if
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
it's not posted
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
so my wife and I both support these
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
bills as written
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
and with that most of that other
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
information is in this letter I'll open
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
see none um thank you for your testimony
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is AJ Hunter I'm
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
here representing myself I live in
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
Conway New Hampshire thank you for
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
letting me speak on this issue I
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
um I'm ignorant to a lot of the stuff
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's going on here and I'll admit that
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
um also kind of biased as a non-land
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
owner I'm very grateful to the common
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
law that we have and to the private
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
landowners that do allow us to access
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
their land I hunt predominantly on
 
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
public I do intermix with private that
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
is not posted and private that is posted
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
I utilize game cameras on public land
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
and the public that is not posted
 
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.210 align:start position:0%
and the public that is not posted
um

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
what I see here is the first step to
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
restrict recreational use of tools on
 
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
private land
 
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
again a game camera is used for hunting
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
trapping all that stuff I know
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
photographers who use them to capture
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
pictures of wildlife there were
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
amendments that were introduced to 300
 
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
foot buffer zone around a dwelling or a
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
building that was taken out in a
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
previous committee that would have been
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
reasonable to put in there the other
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
thing that I see when it comes to large
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
tracks of landowner is something that
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
hasn't been brought up here it's the 20
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
recreational discount on current use
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
property tax when I see that I see a
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
financial and an economic thing again
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm ignorant to stuff so I ask questions
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
about these things
 
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I do think that it does need to be
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
addressed I think that especially with
 
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
the live action cameras where we can see
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
stuff there that that's it's absurd
 
00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
there is a right to privacy that people
 
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
should have I do question though that
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
right to privacy is that still there
 
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
when the land is open to the public for
 
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:22.460 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
and posting the property would be making
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
it not open and would really codify that
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
that right to privacy I don't believe
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
that we should be encouraging people to
 
00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:35.540 align:start position:0%
post I just see these types of things
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
asking questions hoping that you all can
 
00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:38.690 align:start position:0%
asking questions hoping that you all can
maybe

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
pump the brakes on this this year have a
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
little bit more deliberation discussion
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
on what we can do to actually ensure a
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
healthy benefit on both sides thank you
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:53.339 align:start position:0%
any questions to the witness
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you members
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice committee I'll
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
be brief because previous speakers have
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
pretty much touched upon a lot of what I
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
was going to say
 
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
but I I'm here today to support SB 14.
 
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.130 align:start position:0%
but I I'm here today to support SB 14.
um

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
many of my constituents have contacted
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
me and asked me to come and support this
 
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.890 align:start position:0%
me and asked me to come and support this
bill

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
I do support this bill I support hunting
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
I support property rights as well
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
being able to access private land is a
 
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.270 align:start position:0%
being able to access private land is a
privilege

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
privilege
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
and as a courtesy we should ask the
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
owner permission to place cameras on
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
private land
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
we have to respect property rights
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
and bottom line these game cameras their
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance its surveillance on private
 
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.530 align:start position:0%
surveillance its surveillance on private
property

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know if it's your land you don't
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
want to be walking out on your property
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere and doing something and be
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
I agree that um
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
we want to provide public access to
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
private land
 
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
but again we have to respect
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
that hunting and access to the private
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
land is a privilege
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that property rights and privacy are
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
more important
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%

I have provided you with a handout this
 
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.790 align:start position:0%
I have provided you with a handout this
morning

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
let our testimony
 
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I just would like to point out out
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
of that letter and stress that
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
any camera placed on private property
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
without the landowner's knowledge of it
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
being placed with a knowledge of who
 
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
placed it makes it in effect a
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
surveillance device and we believe it is
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
that simple
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
and in closing I just would like to add
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
and many of our
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
the landowners here who are our Farm
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
Bureau members as well have said it said
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
it very well that that in our membership
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
in general does takes great pride in in
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
keeping our land open and I know
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
personally for my family's land is
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
nothing better when you're out in the
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
yard you're working and somebody stops
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
by and thanks you for the for you know a
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
walk they took or or Wildlife they saw
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
and and that's that is uh
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
um it's very important uh to I think to
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
most landowners to to be able to share
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
their their their land
 
00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:22.910 align:start position:0%
their their their land
um

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
but in the end it is a courtesy that a
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
landowner should have the ability that
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
if they do not want a camera up on a
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
spot or a place or a time that they
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to say no and Mr
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
chair and more specifics to what this
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
committee is looking at the fine
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
schedule I just wanted to say that we
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
did work on this the bill with uh
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
fishing game and and I'll let the
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
colonel speak to that you know
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
specifically but to their
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
um it is something that we we uh we do
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
we do strongly support the bill and asks
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
Vita recommend it is ought to pass and
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that thank you
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
any questions for this Witness
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
Matt Leahy I'm the public policy
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
director for the society for the
 
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
protection of New Hampshire Forest we
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
support the bill for really the reasons
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
you've already heard so I won't repeat
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
those I did just want to briefly mention
 
00:47:44.089 --> 00:47:44.099 align:start position:0%
our interest in this issue and also just
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
make one additional point so the four
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
Society we are a private non-profit land
 
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:52.940 align:start position:0%
trust and Forestry organizations so we
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
own and protect land and and as part of
 
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.730 align:start position:0%
own and protect land and and as part of
our

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:57.740 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:00.500 align:start position:0%
ownership and management we do conduct
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
Forest management you know Timber
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
Harvest on these lands we own so
 
00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
um you know we do view ourselves as part
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the network of private landlords in
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
in our state and I just make one point
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
um about the reason we support the bill
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know we do view it you know we view
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits one of the key
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
benefits is that it will we think lead
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
to more and improved interactions
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
between private landowners and you know
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
those people who who are using their
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
lands and not just for uh for hunting
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
but you know hiking bird watching all
 
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.609 align:start position:0%
but you know hiking bird watching all
that

00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and we think that's really important
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
um you know again as you've heard
 
00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:45.349 align:start position:0%
um you know again as you've heard
um

00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know maintaining these traditional
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
uses of our land is very important
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's why you know that's one of the
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
reasons why we do protect land so again
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
we think
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
you know improving those relationships
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
and interactions between landowners and
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
and the people who use their land is is
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
very important so again we support the
 
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.230 align:start position:0%
very important so again we support the
bill

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
have to answer any questions are there
 
00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
any questions for the witness
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Karsten Springs is
 
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.650 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Kyle Baker and
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Federation New Hampshire
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Federation is a Statewide
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
non-profit that represents approximately
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
50 Fish and Game clubs and associations
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%

the state
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
we're here to fully support Senate Bill
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
14. we think that this bill threads the
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
needle in preserving the Open Access to
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
lands but allowing and respecting the
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
private landowners in their willingness
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
to continue to allow for hunting and
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
fishing to happen on their land
 
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
we've been working with both Farm Farm
 
00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:32.099 align:start position:0%
Bureau the Timberland owners fish and
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
game department for a number of years
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
now on legislation that we think uh will
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
address the problem as well as continue
 
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
to allow and Foster an active Sporting
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
Community in New Hampshire game cameras
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
are in as you heard are becoming
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
increasingly popular it wasn't long ago
 
00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:53.099 align:start position:0%
that a game camera was you know 200 now
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
they're twenty dollars and they send the
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
pictures directly to your phone so
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
they're becoming more popular they're
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
also an incredible tool when it comes to
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
recruiting new Hunters there's nothing
 
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
that gets a kid more excited than
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
showing them a picture of a bear or a
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
deer that you know passed through the
 
00:51:09.049 --> 00:51:09.059 align:start position:0%
woods behind their house the night
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
before and it could you know can really
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
help bring people into the sport as well
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
but that said there is a privacy concern
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
and we need to respect the folks that
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
allow us to hunt on their lands so we're
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
here to support I'm happy to answer any
 
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
questions but I wanted to be brief and
 
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
respect your time this morning
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if this has already been
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
covered maybe I missed it but two game
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
cameras transmit sound
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
um they do there are some that have the
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
ability to transmit sound which is a
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
whole nother level of um of concern and
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
privacy um but primarily
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
um the average game camera uh that you
 
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:53.579 align:start position:0%
know when I saw talk about a 20 game
 
00:51:53.579 --> 00:51:54.710 align:start position:0%
know when I saw talk about a 20 game
camera

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
camera
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
um they're primarily transmitting
 
00:51:56.339 --> 00:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
um they're primarily transmitting
pictures

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
pictures
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
Silent Video but there are some that
 
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:03.980 align:start position:0%
have the ability to transmit
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative Bolden from
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
my understanding the um they can record
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
video and sound and keep it on a card on
 
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:14.579 align:start position:0%
the camera but for the most part what's
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
sent is just the pictures because of the
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
memory and data required thank you for
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier unlike some of the
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
western states a lot of the land in
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
particularly in the East but New
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially about 76 percent of
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
it is is privately owned and we have a
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
great tradition of of what we call Open
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
Access people being allowed to enter
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
enter private property to recreate
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
and and use use that and that has really
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
spawned a very robust outdoor recreation
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
um to the tune of over a billion dollars
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
a year of economic activity and this is
 
00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:57.500 align:start position:0%
everything from snowmobiling hiking
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
nature observation Hunting Fishing and
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know for us when we look at you know
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
those are traditional land uses you
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
heard current use mentioned earlier and
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
in fact current use actually provides an
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
incentive to land a further incentive to
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
landowners to maintain their property
 
00:54:16.859 --> 00:54:18.370 align:start position:0%
landowners to maintain their property
open

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:18.380 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
and it's the the statute RSA 79a A4 is
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
is pretty specific it's it's skiing
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing fishing hunting hiking or
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
nature observation these are the those
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
are the you maintain your property open
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
12 months of the year
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
um that is in the current youth statute
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
as a landowner you can receive an
 
00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:42.380 align:start position:0%
additional 20
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
reduction on your tax assessment and
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
that was quite intentional
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
um it was intentional to Foster and
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
encourage landowners to maintain open
 
00:54:56.329 --> 00:54:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
um as you heard earlier cameras the the
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
game cameras
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
um the prices have come down they are
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
the technology has advanced
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
um and many landowners feel that they
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
are truly an invasion of their privacy
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
you've I won't reiterate what you've
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
heard earlier and for us we feel Senate
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
bill 14 does a good job at is is the
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
prior speaker said it threading that
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
needle not prohibiting the use of game
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
cameras we're not saying no game cameras
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere know how don't use them but
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
we're saying look
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
give us the courtesy
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
get the land ask the landowner for
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
permission to put them up and put your
 
00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:41.180 align:start position:0%
name and contact information on them
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
people own land for a host of reasons
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
um and you know the idea or the notion
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
that well let's just limit this to 300
 
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
feet within a dwelling or within a
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
driveway that does not cover that family
 
00:55:58.730 --> 00:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
picnic area that may be up on the back
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
side of a mountain
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
um that that does not that does not
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
include a perhaps a family family burial
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
plot down you know on the back side of
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
the back side of the meadow that's more
 
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
than 300 feet away and for landowners
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
these are special places and they don't
 
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
want to feel as if that area would could
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
get invaded private the privacy in that
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
area could get invaded with the camera
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
and so we feel that Senate bill 14
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
the permission and the labeling are
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
really common courtesy we think they're
 
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
they're great tools we have members that
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
use them many of our members I would
 
00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
dare say the vast majority of our
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
members do open their open their land
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
for for hunting I am a hunter
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
um and I get a I get a real charge when
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
people hunt on my property youth turkey
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
weekend father and his son came up they
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
were new to the area asked me about
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
turkey hunting I showed them I I gave
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
them pretty good directions on where
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
I've seen a couple times earlier and
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
said go go for it go you know this is
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
great and so I think this bill really
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
does a good job at threading that needle
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
is is Kyle said and I think in the end
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
we'll maintain a better relationship
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
between Hunters The Hunting Community
 
00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:23.339 align:start position:0%
and and landowners out there
 
00:57:26.569 --> 00:57:26.579 align:start position:0%
um the the Senate Bill 15 likewise put
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
your name and contact information
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
we just want to know who to contact
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
UM as I've testified earlier you go into
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
a logging garage or a forester's office
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
in November and it's like a hunter's
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
pick and save because many times there's
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
cameras or there's tree stands that that
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
they have encountered or
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know that that they have to remove
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
or that fell off the tree whatever and
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
it's in the corner and they said I don't
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
even know who to contact
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so again I think just labeling them
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
in on this on the cameras in particular
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
getting that permission is is key
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll I'll conclude my
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd be happy to try to answer
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
any questions and I I thank you for your
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question regarding do
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
um any members that own large tracts of
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
land that are out of state that um in
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
other words I guess what I'm getting at
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
is I've heard some concerns from the
 
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
hunting communities like how would I get
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
in touch with someone that's kind of
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
like absentee if you will where do I go
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
to get permission as a yeah great
 
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.730 align:start position:0%
to get permission as a yeah great
question

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
um well and there's it's actually become
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
very easy to contact landowners
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
um Onyx anyone that hunts knows there
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
are programs out there that can that can
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
identify who the who the owner is
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
um in fact that young man and his son
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
came up and pulled his map up and said
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay where is that where is your hay
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
field that you said that we could go in
 
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I could Point him right to it
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
there's that the other piece is that
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
many and if there is an out-of-state
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
landowner if if property's owned by a
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
trust or it's owned by someone who lives
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
out of state they they almost all have a
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
local manager they almost all have
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
someone like you heard earlier like a Mr
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
Eames or another local manager and it's
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's relatively easy to identify those
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
if they've done a Timber sale in recent
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
history there's a whole you have Timber
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
tax records all of that where people are
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
filing documents at the town office it's
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
open for public disclosure that says
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
who's the who's the quote land manager
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
for that out of state
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and so there are ways to ways to
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
identify it it's not impossible Onyx
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
would be your first go-to place tax
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
records are another and
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
um of course asking around town in in
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
looking at you know trying to figure out
 
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay calling a local logger or calling a
 
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
local Forester
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
who owns the peace on
 
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
you know Bear Mountain Road oh yeah
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's owned by such and such that's
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
actually uh I may not I may be mistaken
 
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
but I think I have that app Onyx on my
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
phone right now it's an awesome app well
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
primarily because it shows you the
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
distance from distance from uh
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
residences if you where you were going
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
to fire a weapon or something make sure
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
you're not within that that footage
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
that app would show me then who who owns
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
that property is that I I that app I've
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to some Foresters and other
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
other Hunters um Onyx is one there are
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
other apps out there that and of course
 
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
you go to a town website many of these
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
towns have tax records right there
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
electronically I've had I've had folks
 
01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
on their phone go to a town go to a town
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
website and pull up the pull up the app
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
um again on the Onyx one I don't have
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
that on my phone this fellow had it on
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
on his phone
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
um and he was walking me through it and
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
it appeared to have had my name on it on
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
my parcel so thank you any further
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
questions for the witness
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mr chair you could
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
rule this question out of order but I
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
can't help but ask why do people shoot
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
turkeys you can't eat them
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
actually I I would answer that by
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
telling you that the breasts are quite
 
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.530 align:start position:0%
telling you that the breasts are quite
delicious

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
delicious
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
um feel free to expound
 
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:35.490 align:start position:0%
I can give you some recipes
 
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:37.430 align:start position:0%
I can give you some recipes
[Laughter]

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
yeah they do in springtime that they
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
hunt them in the fall and in the spring
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
and it's yeah this time of year month of
 
01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.490 align:start position:0%
and it's yeah this time of year month of
May

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
May
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
oh yeah at this point the chair
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.930 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
committee for your time and your service
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
that hundred dollars reminds us every
 
01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:11.339 align:start position:0%
now and then that that is uh really some
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
pretty good service that you provide for
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
us so I want to start the same way I
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
started every one of these hearings by
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
thanking these landowners behind me who
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
took time out of their day for a fourth
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
time to come down here and and I'd like
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
you to remember one very important fact
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned to me in the hallway
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're here to ask you to allow them to
 
01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
to keep their land open I think that's
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
kind of interesting I can see it if they
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
came down to post it they're here in an
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
effort to keep it open for guys like me
 
01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
who want to hunt so that we can hunt
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
later on and I think what they're asking
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think I firmly believe what
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
they're asking is reasonable and another
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
point I want to make and I know I'm
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
going to embarrass her and I I will ask
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
for forgiveness but Mrs Thompson has
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
never testified before and felt strongly
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
enough today to come down for the first
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
time so I commend her for doing that and
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
that's how important it is to these
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
landowners it is the number one
 
01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:05.579 align:start position:0%
complaint excuse me that I get in the
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
fall is from landowners who find tree
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
stands and or cameras on their property
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have any knowledge that
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
they were placed there oh it didn't have
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to say yes or no to it
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
and so they asked me if people can
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
legally do that and I I just I don't we
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
don't ever lie to anyone and I said yes
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
they can by law and so the next actual
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
question is how do I prevent that well I
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't really want to answer that
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
question because the only way that they
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
can prevent it is to post their property
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm not in that business I work
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
pretty hard and my staff works pretty
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
hard to encourage people to try and
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
address the issues of why they posted
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
their property and get that property
 
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.930 align:start position:0%
their property and get that property
opened

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
opened
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and and you heard several landowners
 
01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
behind me who are knowledgeable enough
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
from all four corners of the state by
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
the way we have landowners here from the
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
North Country we have landowners from
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
the southwest corner of the state and
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
the central part of the state so it's a
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
good representative representation of
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
our entire State and it's a good
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
representation of the landowners that I
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
speak with regularly and so I I don't
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
lie to them I tell them you can prevent
 
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
it by Pro posting your land and you
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
would lose your tax benefit if you were
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of that I can tell you
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of landowners that are
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
here today that really don't I don't
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
think that's a deciding factor I think
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's a mistake to think that that's
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
going to keep our land open because of
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
from experience I can tell you it
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't they get to a point where
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're tired of it and I would ask you
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
to think about this I'm a landowner I
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
pay eight thousand dollars a year in
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
taxes it's a lot of money
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
and my land is open and always will be
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
open under any circumstance for a whole
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
host of reasons but I would be very
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
angry if I went out my back door and
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
walked on my property and found a camera
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and someone didn't have the courtesy to
 
01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
just ask I would have allowed it a lot
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
of these landowners are not here I guess
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
I won't speak for these folks a lot of
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
landowners I speak with are not against
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
cameras they just want to know who it is
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
they want to know and there's certain
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
areas on their property that they don't
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
want a camera and you know the way I
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
look at that is I've got a small piece
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
nothing like Mr Thompson has nothing
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
like the acreage that he has but I have
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
a small piece that's very important to
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
me if someone were to park a car behind
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
my home or behind any of your homes you
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
would immediately call the police
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
well the landowner feels that way when
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
they find a camera that no one's asked
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
permission for it's on their property be
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
it 300 feet from their home or 3 000
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
feet that's their property they're
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
paying for that the taxes don't go down
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
the further we get away from a home
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
right they pay the same money so that
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
land is just as important to them on
 
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
that Back 40 as it is the front 40.
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
please remember that I think that's key
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's an issue really of of a landowner's
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
rights so so now I sit back taking these
 
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.109 align:start position:0%
rights so so now I sit back taking these
calls

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
calls
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and and I and I'm my other goal is to
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
protect the Sportsman that's really and
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
that my heart is in that because I'm a
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
sportsman so how do we balance these two
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
things and I think this bill has done a
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
really good job in doing that we got
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
together I got together with the
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Federation we got them on board
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
the sports men and women we got the Farm
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau on board we got the Timberlands
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
Association we all got together and said
 
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a way to do this so
 
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
that we not we're not punishing hunters
 
01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
and we're recognizing the right of
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
landowners and this this bill was
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
written kind of with all of those
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
efforts in mind it's been changed I've
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
lost track of how many times it's
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
changed but I think what's in before you
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
today looking at it
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
um is is probably the best version so
 
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's one that I really I really would
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
encourage you to consider
 
01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
encourage you to consider
um

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
I'm I want to make sure I've hit all my
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
but another thing that that is I never
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
thought of happening so if you follow
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
any of the deer hunting websites or or
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
not websites but that shows you what I
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
know about the internet Facebook pages
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
my my uh my younger officers do that and
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
they tell the old man how to how to look
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
at this stuff so I start doing it and I
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
was amazed when I see some of the some
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
Hunters have areas that they put their
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
stands and their cameras up and they go
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
back to this area year after year like I
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
do and they they you know they harvest
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
deer every year and it becomes their
 
01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.589 align:start position:0%
deer every year and it becomes their
area

01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see pictures posted on
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
Facebook of a hunter standing or a
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
person standing in front of their camera
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
and they'll literally post on Facebook
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
and say who is this guy that's in my
 
01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
and say who is this guy that's in my
area

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
on three occasions it's been the
 
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.750 align:start position:0%
on three occasions it's been the
landowner

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
now I don't have to tell you how how
 
01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:30.299 align:start position:0%
quickly my phone rings when that happens
 
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
because now you've got a landowner whose
 
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
picture's on Facebook he's been insulted
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
by these people and he wants them off
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
their property I can't do a lot with
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
that quite frankly I can't honestly say
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
well you know that that wasn't you know
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
it just puts you in a really bad and I
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't think Hunters do it intentionally
 
01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:48.380 align:start position:0%
I just don't think they think about that
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
and that happens to people so that's
 
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:53.579 align:start position:0%
that's another concern about I have fun
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
with them I stand in front of them I
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
hold cards up call me because I know it
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
takes the picture and Hunter's going to
 
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
see it I'm with these guys I never hear
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
from these folks of course we take them
 
01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
on occasion when a landowner doesn't
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
want them there we'll remove them when I
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
get a very angry landowner because I
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't want him to post it so we'll
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
remove it and I I could put more
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
Sporting Goods out of business with the
 
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
equipment I have because nobody ever
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
claims it they don't they think they're
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to get a ticket and and so they
 
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
don't it's it's just a mess the way it
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
is and I think this is balances both
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
this is going to allow a hunter an
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go in and still put his
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
cameras up and it's going to respect the
 
01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
rights of the landowner so you had a
 
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
couple of really good questions one is
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
how do we find the landowner
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative Roy the chairman brought
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
up there are two apps that I use so onx
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
is an app and I can pull it up and show
 
01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
it to you now but it shows property
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
lines and and I've walked my own using
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
this and it's very accurate my officers
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
are using this for distances close to a
 
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
home we've entered it in a courtroom and
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's been accepted what's really neat
 
01:08:56.329 --> 01:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
about it is it tells you pretty much
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
without exception who the landowner is
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
you immediately see the name you can
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
contact that person it shows you where
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
their home is where their outbuildings
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
are so it helps Hunters stay away from
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
those areas or from those sensitive
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
areas there's and you on X there's a fee
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
for that you can download it on your
 
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
phone I think I pay 31 a year for each
 
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
app uh Hunt stand is another free app
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
that I have on my phone I I from a
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
question from one of the other hearings
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure yeah Hunt stand is
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
free you can go to the go to a App Store
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
I can't but you get folks that know how
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
to do this can and you can purchase this
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
app and it'll do the same thing so it's
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
pretty accurate because it is an issue I
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
would encourage and have encouraged
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
people who have called us who couldn't
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
find a landowner we have a lot of
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
resources and I'll help you do that
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
because the goal is to make everybody as
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
happy as to give access to them and and
 
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
to if you can't find a landowner we can
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
help you do that so
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
um it's not impossible to do certainly
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
we purposely excluded
 
01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and I think this is important
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
municipally on land publicly owned land
 
01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
land owned or managed by the state of
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we excluded permission
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
being required for any of those tracks
 
01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:11.660 align:start position:0%
so it's solely for private land
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
municipally owned land was Town land I I
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
argued that is not private land that
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
would be excluded anyway but we wrote it
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
in just to be clear so anything owned by
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the public we felt Hunters should be
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay to go on that so we excluded that
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's just the private landowner that
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we wanted them to ask permission
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
another very good question was how do we
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
make the case
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
on 24 hours so and how that came about
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
was the as technology advances we have
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
automatic rifles now that can be fired
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
without folks holding them that are
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
coming out we have cameras that film
 
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
live we have
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
um you know that the technology is ever
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
expanding and so we were concerned as an
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
agency about Hunter ethics we were
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about losing Fair Chase
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
principles getting away from that that's
 
01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
an argument that's used to end the sport
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
of hunting fishing and trapping and and
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
we engage in those arguments on a
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
regular basis so I felt it was important
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
for us as an agency to get ahead of that
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
and so we said you know what those
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
aren't fair to be able to sit in your
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
living room and watch a deer go to a
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
tree stand and throw on your coat and go
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
out back and shoot a deer and everybody
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
I talked to says well you can't do that
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
well I'm here to tell you you would be
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
mistaken it can be done and it's done
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
pretty regularly with great success
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
quite frankly and so we we came up with
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rule a number of years
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
ago that said and still exists today
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
that says that you can't Harvest a deer
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours of it being viewed on a
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
camera and we quite honestly I helped
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
write that and I had no idea that I
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
would ever be able to enforce that law
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
because how would you do that and I'm
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
here to tell you we do it often and and
 
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised by that but the reason
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we do it is because the honesty of
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
the people that we encounter which is
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
refreshing you go to 100 and you say did
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
you see that on a camera and some of
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
these folks will admit to that which is
 
01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.370 align:start position:0%
these folks will admit to that which is
nice

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
nice
 
01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
um other times you can get a search
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
warrant and pull a camera as the
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
chairman spoke about and in his date and
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
time stamped on the camera even now uh
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
the these young kids that we've hired
 
01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
can get it if you've deleted it so it
 
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
can be found uh frankly I'm not that
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
worried we're not that worried about
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
hunters we've had setups where people
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
had wired cameras sitting in their
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
living room really bad poaching uh
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance they're rare but that we've
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
had a number of those where we've made
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
those cases so those cases are made but
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
the message here I think is more
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
important a message that it says when we
 
01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
when we put that in this law is that we
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
believe in Hunter ethics we believe in
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
Fair Chase principles and here it is in
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
the law for everyone to see so I think
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
that's an important piece the next very
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
good question was does a landowner have
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
to call us to go get it and my answer to
 
01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
that would be even though it's in this
 
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
law I would never charge a landowner for
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
removing something on his own property
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
but but I've had many issues with that a
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
most recent one I had a young woman
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
remove a camera that was pointed at her
 
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
house so and of course there's always
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
more of these stories than what you get
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
the first time but the story was I had a
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
camera pointed at my house which I
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
thought was alarming and she said and so
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
I cut the cable and I removed it now the
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
police department's calling me and
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
telling me that I owe them a camera and
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
that I have to pay for the damage I did
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
to the cable so I called the police
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
department expecting to hear more and I
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
was not let down it was a lot more she
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
had been removed from her home wasn't
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be back there they'd put a
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
camera on to make sure that she wasn't
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
coming back and they caught her doing
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the bottom line was though that was
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
the property of the town
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
and she destroyed it removing the camera
 
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
because most these cameras are locked on
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
so you're going to be forced to cut the
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
cable or cut the lock and I can tell you
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
from experience you'll put me in a
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
position where a camera owner will say
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
well that's good that that Mr Roy
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
removed my camera but he destroyed my
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
lock when he did it and he needs to pay
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
me for the lock and you know what he's
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
correct you do and so I wanted to a
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
landowner to avoid that I didn't want to
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
put a Lander on in that position so we
 
01:14:11.169 --> 01:14:11.179 align:start position:0%
put in here that you should call
 
01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
the other important piece of this law
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
was the fact that we asked for the name
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
and contact information to be put on the
 
01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
camera giving a landowner an opportunity
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
to not get the police involved he could
 
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
just call Mr Roy and say remove your
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
camera I don't want it on my property
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
and give him a chance to work it out so
 
01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
it was a we tried very hard throughout
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
this bill to balance all of that and to
 
01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
give everyone something that we could
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
all work with so that's that's basically
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
how this all came about and lastly the
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
fine amount so the fine originally I
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
think when it was in the Senate I
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
followed chapter 6 25 under the criminal
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
code which denotes the limits for
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
violations limits for misdemeanors and
 
01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
it says in a violation if you have a
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
violation of law you can charge up to a
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in fines I don't know
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
of any violation today that would bring
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars in any courtroom but
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's the limit that the law used so we
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
use that verbiage we scared the Senate
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
because I think they thought we were
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
going to charge a thousand dollars every
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
time we found one of these cameras and
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
so they reduced that to the 125 I don't
 
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
I don't really care what the fine is to
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I don't have a
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
personal preference on that there needs
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
to be a consequence so that people will
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
not do it if the law tells you not to do
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
it there needs to be a consequence so I
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
would entertain anything that you wanted
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
to put in there for a fine amount but
 
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's that's historically that's why
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
we're at the place that we are I'd
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
really encourage you to think about this
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
I know that Hunters I know that you've
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
gotten emails from Hunters I I this
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Conway brings up some
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
some valid points but I think we we
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to address those
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
we're allowing the cameras we're just
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
asking you to have the courtesy to ask
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
the landowner if he's okay with it
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's all and I don't think that's a
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
big reach thank you sir very much
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you colonel from a criminal
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
justice point of view
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
would it not be a problem for you to
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
make a case if the landowners were out
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
there taking these cameras down when you
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
get there the evidence is gone that the
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
violation never occurred is that not it
 
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
could affect it yes so you could I never
 
01:16:14.689 --> 01:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
thought you could get into a chain of
 
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
custody issue so if you had a camera on
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
a bait site and there was no permission
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
for the bait to be there either which
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
happens and he took the camera and then
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
I looked to get the camera back from him
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
and download that evidence later I would
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
have a problem in a courtroom with a
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
good defense attorney saying well how do
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know he didn't put that picture on
 
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
him how do you know he didn't so that's
 
01:16:37.729 --> 01:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
a very good point furthermore that that
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
it was ever placed without permission
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct okay thank you
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the colonel
 
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
I have two by my first one yes and we
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
talked about you can't
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
take the deer if you saw it on the
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
camera that day yeah what if I start on
 
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
the day before but it came back the day
 
01:16:59.630 --> 01:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
I went out
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
how do you know well you don't and so
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
some discretion has to be used in that
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
and I I gotta tell you I don't see them
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
I don't see those I see every summons
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
these guys issue I review everyone
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
um because I look for things like that
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're doing what we're
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing and I don't see
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
that happening when I see it happening
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
is on what it's used in conjunction with
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
poaching or illegal baiting because it
 
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
could happen you could have you could
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
have a camera see a picture of a deer
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not against them in this
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
regard people work hard they don't have
 
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
time to sit in their stands every day I
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
get that so if they get a camera and it
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
says okay there's a buck coming here
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
every night at four o'clock if I get in
 
01:17:42.169 --> 01:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
the stand I have a likelihood of seeing
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
a deer that's what those cameras should
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
be used for so I saw that yesterday
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
today I'm beyond that time I want to sit
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
in my stand and without me knowing it
 
01:17:50.689 --> 01:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
that deer came out at 10 o'clock and got
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
caught on my camera you're going to know
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
that in an interview you're gonna know
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with folks
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and and so that's that's a gray area
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't happen often for us so
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
yeah good question
 
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
those cameras going to be in the auction
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
this Saturday I don't know you know to
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I have not brought
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
those cameras over there I we should
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
probably do that I've got a pile of them
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
all over the state and I should go and
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's another reason that I
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
think this exploded is because cameras
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
when they first came out were very
 
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
expensive there weren't many people and
 
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
we use them I put them up for litter
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
sites when we have a road that people
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
are going down and dumping mattresses we
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
put these cameras out to try and catch
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
people we've had great success with them
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
so they are a great tool but but what's
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
happened now is the cost of these has
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
greatly reduced so you can buy these
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
things for twenty dollars and I think
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
people are there we've got cameras on
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
cameras trying to I've got cameras
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
pointed at other cameras to figure out
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
who's hunting and you know it's just
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
gotten ridiculous and I just think there
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
has to be some a little slow down there
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
before we lose our opportunity to hunt
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
on land owned by these generous folks
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
behind us I agree with you
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative salic
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:01.850 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just I'm not a hunter I'm gonna
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
put that out there I'm not a hiker I get
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
lost if you put me between three trees
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
so please don't go yeah I'm a city girl
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
my kids won't let me in the Woods by
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
myself anymore
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious whether with the cameras
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the way the system is now if a landowner
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
were to go out and see cameras on their
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
property and they happen to be traveling
 
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
with a backpack full of blankets and
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
keep tossing them over the cameras is
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
that like
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of trying to understand whose
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
rights are are so a landowner has every
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
right to do that I've suggested the
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
landowners rather than take it down if
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about
 
01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.189 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about
um

01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
a camera pointed at a barn because
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
people don't like Farmers for instance
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh you have every right to go over and
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
put I suggested put a good piece of tape
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
over it or covering the camera and
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
calling us and we'll come and get it you
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
have every right to do that every right
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
if you destroy property or you start
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
seizing property of other people then
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're kind of in a in a tricky spot
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes ma'am
 
01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay representative I know
 
01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I just wanted
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
to ask I was thinking about kind of the
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that would fall on Fish
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
and Game and it sounds to me first of
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
all like uh the phone calls that you're
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
getting from landowners you're already
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
getting that this would just kind of
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
provide a a better process for it but
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
also I think on behalf of the hunters
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
let me just say not a hunter I own
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
literally a tenth of an acre but
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
um my question would be you know I would
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
think that in order to be fair and for
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
this to be um a reasonable expectation
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
of hunters that would need to there
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
would need to be a lot of Education
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a lot of organizations that
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
work with people yes
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
um you know that represent a lot of
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
people who would you know good question
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about you know how
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
you would go about educating the public
 
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
so that it is reasonable so we did that
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
a good example of how we that's a good
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question I should
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
have testified to that so um we because
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from Conway is a very good
 
01:20:59.689 --> 01:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
example of that and and I don't mean to
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
pick on him but he's a very good example
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
because he came in kind of late so he's
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this out and most
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
hunters will be in that position and so
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
when you folks gave us the lead law for
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
fishing I don't know if you recall that
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
when lead was excluded from being used
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
for tackle for fishing it was almost two
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
years before we ever issued a summons on
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
that so we went around when you when you
 
01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
caught people without illegal stuff we'd
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
explain to them why it was illegal you
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
can't purchase it you can't possess it
 
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
you can't use it we used it as an
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to educate people I see us
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
doing that for a good deal at least a
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
year for cameras because it's going to
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
take time for people that work and can't
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
attend these hearings to understand so
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
we would educate them long before we
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
charge them you know the thing I
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
stressed in my office is very important
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
to me the goal of law enforcement is not
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
to punish people although there's
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
officers out there that believe that's
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
our goal it's not our goal is to change
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
that behavior so if you can change that
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
behavior by having a conversation with
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
somebody you succeeded you don't have to
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
write the ticket that's the judge's job
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's not my job so education is a is a
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
very important piece so we would plan if
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
this were to pass we would put it on our
 
01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
website we would do public notification
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
for it and we would be on an educational
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
campaign for a year and some of the
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
younger guys get frustrated with that
 
01:22:18.169 --> 01:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
but it's important I think and then when
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
you when you start charging people there
 
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
is no reason at that point a year later
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't they shouldn't know that
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is the law it's been well
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
publicized so very good question
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
and and you produce a pamphlet you hand
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
out every year when everybody renews
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
their license there in the front of the
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
book will put changes to the laws this
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
year and we'll put this thing front and
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
center and we'd get a lot of call I'm
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of calls on it now from
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
both landowners and Camera people
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
because they want to know where we're at
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
all the good point Rob the effective
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
date we move the effective date out on
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
this bill if you look I think it went uh
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's not even going to be in effect this
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
fall for that reason to start the
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
educational but thank you rob to start
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
the educational piece and that's good
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
because yes bow season starts in two
 
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
months three months it's too soon we've
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
got people already out there so it'll
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
give them a chance to do something
 
01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.050 align:start position:0%
give them a chance to do something
different

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes sir
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
um since we primarily look at a
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
violation a violation would occur when
 
01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
someone takes a camera and puts it on
 
01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's land and it's not labeled
 
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
number one correct and they don't have
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
permission number two they would have to
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
meet both of those that's correct
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
situations and then that would be a
 
01:23:33.169 --> 01:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
violation yeah yeah and in those
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
scenarios you know we don't always issue
 
01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:38.219 align:start position:0%
both violation judicial warning for I
 
01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
would anticipate a warning for one and a
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
violation ticket for the other
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
until we get people but yes that would
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
be two separate violations
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
I'm going to attract my follow-up I'll
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
I have a question in representative
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
Murray yes I'm thinking about how I'm
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
going to label my tree stands and I'm
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
picturing a three by five card laminated
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
with a zip tie somewhere up on the stand
 
01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.530 align:start position:0%
with a zip tie somewhere up on the stand
yep

01:24:09.530 --> 01:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
would there
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
would it be worth looking at a potential
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
for someone tampering with taking that
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
off it would be and so you know if
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
anyone were to ask me I would tell them
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
to try and engrave it or scratch it on
 
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
there somewhere and I wouldn't even mind
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
if it were you know in a position where
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's not readily seen because I got to
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
tell you me labeling my stuff I'm not
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
real anxious to put my name on a tree
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
stand I've got a few people out there
 
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
they're not real fond of me and so I
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
could see it giving providing an
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
opportunity police officers have already
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
reached out to me and said I don't
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
really want to put my name on that I
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
said well if we're going to make
 
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
everybody else do it fellows we got to
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
do it but I but I get that so I don't
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
know that that would be and I and I
 
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
think we would take that with a you know
 
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
if I were to find a stand like that and
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we may we require them to label bait
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
sites now with a three by five card and
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
typically a hunter will go in and remove
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
it we know that so you go in and you you
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
see the stand and you say to the guy hey
 
01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
you don't have your sign up and he tells
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
you well I had it up I had it on that
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
tree and somebody removed it you tell
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
them put it back up and so it's not it's
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
not a huge deal it's just I would
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
engrave it if I were you and the other
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
reason I would do that if someone stole
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
it it gives us a way to get it back
 
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
which is helpful too I think
 
01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.689 align:start position:0%
which is helpful too I think
hmm

01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Murray and then represent
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
Cardinal for taking my question that
 
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
actually was uh related to that because
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
you know I'm concerned about the Privacy
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
rights of the hunters as well we were
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
too um and you know I got a lot of
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
emails from folks being concerned about
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
you know putting their name and contact
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
information where you know anyone can
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
get it including like you know maybe
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
Peta activist or whatever our
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
anti-hunting and then doxing these
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hunters I guess um how seriously do you
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
think those concerns should be so
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
originally when I wrote the Bill I put
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
name and address and I rethought that
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
for that reason so we put name and
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's why it says contact you know a
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
name and a cell phone or something
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
um but that's a concern I've had many
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hunters say the only thing I would say
 
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
to that is we already require names on a
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
number of different things we require
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
names and addresses on traps
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
um which certainly attracts those types
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
of people
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
um we require names on Bob houses
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
fishing Bob houses bait sites so there's
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
a number of things out there already and
 
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
we've not had knock on wood we've not
 
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
had real issues with that so we don't
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
feel that there will be an issue with
 
01:26:25.679 --> 01:26:26.930 align:start position:0%
feel that there will be an issue with
this

01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we have and we also have
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
we also thank you we also have
 
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
um Good Hunter harassment laws to
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
address that so if someone were to do
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
that I would be all over that because
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
you yeah that escalates very rapidly uh
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you Colonel for taking
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
this question um you know I know you
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
said uh earlier that you would never do
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
this but I'm I'm concerned that the way
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
the law this section 4 is written in
 
01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
other words as I understand this and I
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
generally this seems like a really great
 
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
bill and I you know I very much support
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
but the one in general this bill it
 
01:27:08.689 --> 01:27:08.699 align:start position:0%
seems to me draws an appropriate balance
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
between uh Hunters as an example and and
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
landowners and his and protects
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
landowners the one thing that seems to
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
be an exception to that is this section
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
four which see which it says
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
a property owner's shell not may but
 
01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:26.090 align:start position:0%
a property owner's shell not may but
shell

01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
shell
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
contact the department the fish and game
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
department to have to have a you know a
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
camera removed and so
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
am I wrong that that seems to me that
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
that is actually something that changes
 
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
from what it is now to take away a
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
landowner's right in other words right
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
now if I read this
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
a landowner cannot
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
after If This Were if section four were
 
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
enacted a landowner could not even if
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
they had presumably even if they had
 
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
posted their land no hunting right a
 
01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
landowner and landowner goes out walking
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
on their on their posted land sees a
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
camera they could not just take it down
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
they would have to call you right and
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
that seems to me I just wonder if that
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
is sort of an unintended consequence
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we've we've in that one respect
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
you've you've made it you've taken away
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
some rights from landowners that they
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
currently have yep and I guess as I read
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
it I mean if only if we were to enact
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
this section four and a landowner to
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
would were to do what I just said the
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
landowner would have would be subject to
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
the penalty because they would have
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
violated the statute it could be yes I
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
think more importantly though if they
 
01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
remove it they've subject themselves to
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
civil penalties for the damages to
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
remove it so that's the issue that we've
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
had is when they when a landowner if I
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
felt if we didn't put something in there
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
to tell landowners not to do it the
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
landowners would in fact do it and
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to get into a we've already
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
had we've been the referee in several of
 
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
these where you have a hunter who wants
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
his equipment back and a landowner who
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
says well you're not getting it back
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
because you put it on my property
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
illegally well you can't do that by law
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
you're now you're now seizing equipment
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
that you don't own the law the law uses
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
this same type thought process when it
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
comes to abandoned vehicles or abandoned
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
property that's why our laws now
 
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
criminal laws prevent a landowner for
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
instance from seizing a car left on his
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
property there's a whole bunch of steps
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
they have to go through before they can
 
01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
do that for these same reasons is you
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
you are exposing a landowner it's really
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
a protection for the landowner because
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
you're exposing them to all kinds of
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
civil penalties or violations of law if
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
they seize the camera because then it
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
becomes kind of a kind of a neighborhood
 
01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:50.219 align:start position:0%
dispute between the hunter the Sportsman
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
and landowner because landowners don't
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
want to give them back my experience has
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
been they want to seize it they want to
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
meet the land the Hunter and they want
 
01:29:58.729 --> 01:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
to lecture him and and it never goes
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
well and so we have found that it's
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
better to intervene early in that than
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
wait for that kind of scenario to go on
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
the landowner still has the right he has
 
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
the immediate right to call at any time
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
all we're saying is rather than you go
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
out and expose yourself to these
 
01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
liabilities call us and we'll do it most
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
landowner do that now anyway
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you know and and there I have been
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
asked by the Farm Bureau about that very
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
issue we discussed that when we wrote
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
this bill early on and I I laid out kind
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the issues with allowing people to do
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
that the problems that we've had doing
 
01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
that and we decided just I I want to
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
protect the landowner from that kind of
 
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.470 align:start position:0%
protect the landowner from that kind of
liability

01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I can tell you I would
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
never allow a summons to be written for
 
01:30:43.129 --> 01:30:43.139 align:start position:0%
a landowner doing something on his own
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
property that just wouldn't happen but
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
the LA I think the language needs to be
 
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
strong so that we don't have landowners
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
out there climbing tree stands and
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
seizing this stuff without without the
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
the authority of the law enforcement
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
Community being behind that yeah guys
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
just want to fight you know I guess the
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm not
 
01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
I think you need to draw a distinction
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't you between it's one thing it
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
would seem to me
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the landowner to that sees uh you
 
01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:14.219 align:start position:0%
know a camera or a tree stand in the
 
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
situation we're positive right to go
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
take it down
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's one thing I would it would
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
seem to me the landowner would have the
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
right to do that now if you're talking
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
about and I think this is what you're
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
talking if the if you're talking about
 
01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
the landowner seizing it in the sense of
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's now become my property and I don't
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
have to give it back right there that's
 
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
a different issue isn't it it could be
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
you could separate those too but you
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
still run the risk of most of this stuff
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
that's put up there and I can tell you
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
from experience of seizing a lot of it
 
01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
is locked down or cabled down or or the
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
cables are in and they don't know how to
 
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
function and so when you remove it you
 
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
end up destroying sometimes the property
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
to do it and the minute a landowner does
 
01:31:57.770 --> 01:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
that he's now exposed himself to
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
replacement of that property and I can
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
tell you that's been a problem
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and so I and landowners don't think
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
about that until I tell them that and
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
they're surprised by that but I said
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
well that's a private property even
 
01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
though it's there illegally it's owned
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
by this individual and and you he has
 
01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
the right to be whole and you have to
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
put that you have to put that stuff back
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
that you've destroyed and so it kind of
 
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
exposes a landowner to a liability I
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to the other issue I
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
have the other real concern I have is
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
being caught doing it I can tell you in
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
a uniform I've been caught doing it and
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
and hunters get pretty aggressive about
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
that because that's their property and I
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
worry if a hunter were to find a
 
01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
landowner removing that property we'd
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
we'd expose them to you know you've got
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
armed individuals I just worry about
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
that whole confrontation piece so we
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
kind of put that in here to avoid that
 
01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
that was our goal
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
represent through did you have a
 
01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.350 align:start position:0%
represent through did you have a
question

01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions that scares
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
me representative I
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't I hope we you decided the right
 
01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.050 align:start position:0%
don't I hope we you decided the right
thing

01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:00.890 align:start position:0%
thing
um

01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah no all good they're very
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
good questions and and we did it I kind
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
of insisted on that piece of it just
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
based on my experience with landowners
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
and and Property Owners I worry about
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
putting them in that and the law if you
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
think about criminal law has addressed
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
that at many different levels for the
 
01:33:19.450 --> 01:33:19.460 align:start position:0%
same reasons uh they make you post
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
abandoned cars there's all kinds of
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
things you have to go through before you
 
01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
can seize a car that's left on your
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
property which shouldn't be that way but
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
it has to be
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh my my thing was instead of
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
their whole name and address yeah their
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
first name and a telephone number that I
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
would that would be fine if they put
 
01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
their name it doesn't say last name or
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
first name if it says name and contact
 
01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:47.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
scitec Mr chair I hope the colonel has a
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
good succession plan
 
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
I I have some great people I'm very
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
fortunate that's why I hang on they they
 
01:33:58.370 --> 01:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh I gotta get out of the way here very
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
soon but that's I have good people thank
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
for your testimony unless um
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
Representatives giving you something
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.729 --> 01:34:15.739 align:start position:0%
important reason
 
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm all set okay thank you for your
 
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'd like to try to I wanted to hear what
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
the colonel had to say because I wanted
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
to come at this from a slightly
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
different perspective than what's been
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
presented today we've heard a lot about
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh feelings Traditions technology and so
 
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.450 align:start position:0%
uh feelings Traditions technology and so
forth

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:49.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
and from my perspective and people that
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
I know who want hunting
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
and want to manage Timber and Wildlife
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
you know for everybody to be able to
 
01:34:59.639 --> 01:35:02.149 align:start position:0%
you know for everybody to be able to
enjoy

01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
not doing this creates conflict
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a better climate of
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
concert of cooperation
 
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:17.149 align:start position:0%
concert of cooperation
and

01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:19.129 --> 01:35:19.139 align:start position:0%
getting away from the feelings the
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
traditions and Technology I would like
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
to look I'd like to ask everybody on
 
01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
to look to something that maybe they
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
have not looked at recently the first
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
section of the New Hampshire
 
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.129 align:start position:0%
section of the New Hampshire
Constitution

01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire Constitution is unique
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's much stronger than the Federal
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
Constitution relative to a number of
 
01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.090 align:start position:0%
Constitution relative to a number of
things

01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
everything from property rights
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
it's a choice of gender and race and
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
everything else we've changed it twice
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
within my lifetime that I'm aware of
 
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
so it can be changed we want it to be
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
but the two pillars
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
of our constitution
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
comes down to privacy and property
 
01:36:02.699 --> 01:36:05.090 align:start position:0%
comes down to privacy and property
rights

01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
and to speak to both representative
 
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.770 align:start position:0%
and to speak to both representative
newells

01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
newells
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh point about tenth of an acre
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
it's her property does it matter if it's
 
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
a tenth of an acre or 100 Acre it
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
01:36:24.370 --> 01:36:24.380 align:start position:0%
the property issue related to trees
 
01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's property under New Hampshire law
 
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's a crop under common law it's a crop
 
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
we have the right to harvest
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks in The Hunting Community
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
don't realize
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
when they put a tree I had
 
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
officer Chris McEwen a number of years
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
ago come on to my tree farm and remove
 
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
a property that I've managed since I was
 
01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:48.830 align:start position:0%
a property that I've managed since I was
14.

01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
14.
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
remove a tree tree stand from a veneer
 
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
to representative selig's question about
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
property damage oh I'm afraid she's not
 
01:37:06.490 --> 01:37:06.500 align:start position:0%
here at the moment
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me to be turned on its
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
head to speak maybe to Mr Rhodes Point
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
wherever the Rhodes Point seems to me to
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
be turned on its head
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
that the owner of the land
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
is now going to be held liable for
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
damage to property that somebody has not
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
simply abandoned like a car but
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
literally going on to the property and
 
01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
strapped with a cable to a tree
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
that is a relatively
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty strong indication of a
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
permanent desire to have that
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
that sounds more like trespass
 
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
to me and to a lot of folks who come
 
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
across the situation
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
for all kinds of I mean
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
to not have the courtesy to be able to
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
call as a landowner to call somebody who
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
put a piece of property read a tree
 
01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
stand or camera
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
to not be able to do that and to call
 
01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
them and say hey look you know
 
01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
not against cameras we could put this on
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
a different place uh or whatever I mean
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's what should happen you should not
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
have and I think it speaks to a
 
01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
situation you should not have a somebody
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
like the colonel indicating that they
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
remove these things all the time and
 
01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:27.179 align:start position:0%
they actually call you know they take a
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
picture in front of them with a card
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
held up
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
and yet from what he said nobody comes
 
01:38:38.169 --> 01:38:38.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're even discussing this
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
to this level is really really
 
01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:45.179 align:start position:0%
disturbing I mean I look to my ancestors
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
for a lot of guidance because they dealt
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
with stuff a lot tougher than we are and
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
Technology changes to representative
 
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:52.139 align:start position:0%
Boyden I believe who mentioned question
 
01:38:52.139 --> 01:38:53.390 align:start position:0%
Boyden I believe who mentioned question
about

01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.709 align:start position:0%
about
audio

01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
audio
 
01:38:57.169 --> 01:38:57.179 align:start position:0%
does it really matter
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter whether it's a picture or
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
audio or a drone or a camera strap to a
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
tree technology is changing all the time
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
go back and read our constitution
 
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
the one thing about we can disagree
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
about 10 or 15 or 20 percent of it
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves that's fine
 
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
but there's one thing about the
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
Constitution's the state constitution in
 
01:39:18.179 --> 01:39:19.870 align:start position:0%
Constitution's the state constitution in
particular

01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
it does not allow us to be schizophrenic
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't unless you want to
 
01:39:30.169 --> 01:39:30.179 align:start position:0%
change the Constitution it is what it is
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
and it was respectful of people and
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
their various forms of property
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we need to think about that
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
and we need to think about the diffusion
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
of our resources and the actual cost
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
Associated when we have fish and game
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
going hither and yawn dealing with
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
things that are so easily solved
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
I fully support
 
01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
hunting I have many people who want to
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
my property friends and neighbors they
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
are very possessive of the property
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
in a manner of speaking from a safety
 
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
I fully support this bill
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
to require the simple courtesy
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
of a name
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
or number or whatever is determined to
 
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
be right on a piece of private property
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is transported to another person's
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
property and strapped onto a tree or
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's an observation device it's a form
 
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
of trespass it should not be tolerated
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
look to the Constitution and get rid of
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
an area of conflict
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't mind being challenged on some
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
of these things I've thought them
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
through a lot and I know you folks put
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
in a lot of time
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't challenge you but I would
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
point out that the constitution is to
 
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
restrict the government and not fellow
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
citizens so I'm sorry I couldn't hear
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
that would you say that again the
 
01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.970 align:start position:0%
that would you say that again the
Constitution

01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
um is to restrict the government not
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
fellow citizens having said that I agree
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
with your points the Constitution
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
affirms my perspective Constitution
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
affirms the rights that we have as
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
Citizens those rights in the
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution both federal and state
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
says that we essentially loan those
 
01:41:17.209 --> 01:41:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of forming a more
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
perfect Society in essence
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
correct I think I would love to have a
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
legal debate with you over a cup of
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
coffee but I have to get this so
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
understood but I'm going to put it to
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
the rest of the members then whatever
 
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
your opinion is
 
01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:35.990 align:start position:0%
your opinion is
respectfully

01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
the government should not be
 
01:41:40.729 --> 01:41:40.739 align:start position:0%
getting in the middle
 
01:41:40.739 --> 01:41:45.169 align:start position:0%
getting in the middle
of

01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
issues that affect private property when
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
there's a better way to handle this
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
to make a property owner a landowner
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
liable for damage to a piece of
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
equipment that is being removed by a
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
officer of the law in any shape or form
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's been permanently attached
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
essentially at least for more than a
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
season usually
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's not the place
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
the way I understood it the peace
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
officer takes it
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
the landowner is not responsible that's
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
why the officer is coming to take it and
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
not to land on it and is that correct
 
01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.430 align:start position:0%
not to land on it and is that correct

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
Kyle
 
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:36.530 align:start position:0%
Kyle
good

01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
I simply think it's a very sad situation
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
when we're placing landowners in
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
conflict with people that we actually
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
want to support their rights we want to
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
well excuse me privileges of hunting on
 
01:42:49.609 --> 01:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
land and so forth you are going to be
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
causing if this is not passed in a
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
decent form
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
you are going to be causing the mass
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
posting of many pieces of property
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
across the state that I do not like
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
and I and I I think we need to I've said
 
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
enough but there are no more questions
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you doesn't
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
matter tenth of an acre or 100 it's
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
still your own land thank you for your
 
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:12.470 align:start position:0%
still your own land thank you for your
testimony

01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
as anyone else who has not filled out
 
01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
the card who wishes to test spawn this
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
bill today
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none I hereby close the public
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
hearing on SB 14 and we are going to
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
take a 10 minute break and we will open
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearing SB 15 just for
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
everyone's um edification will be
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
exacting this probably about 15 to 20
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
minutes after we close that hearing so
 
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be moving much more
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
expeditiously because if you testified
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
on 14 there's no need to tell us the
 
01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.600 --> 02:05:09.890 align:start position:0%

that equipment
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
Sarah Pearl hopes that by giving
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
Landover Landover is more say in what
 
02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
goes on on our property it will
 
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
incentivize them to keep their land open
 
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Hunters thank you for
 
02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
allowing me the opportunity to speak
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
this morning if you have any questions
 
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:48.780 align:start position:0%

02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and relay our thanks to Senator Pearl
 
02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:03.659 align:start position:0%
um at this point the chair recognizes
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
um well actually before I call any
 
02:07:06.830 --> 02:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
Witnesses if you've already testified
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
and you're going to testify again please
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
just limit it to the tree stands because
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
we we pretty much understand I think the
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
concept that everyone's trying to
 
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
impress upon us on the private private
 
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
private property and and for the most
 
02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
part I think we are all in agreement so
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
at this point I would call Susan price
 
02:07:25.199 --> 02:07:32.050 align:start position:0%
at this point I would call Susan price
foreign

02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:32.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm Susan price Fish and Game
 
02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
connection commissioner for Carroll
 
02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.410 align:start position:0%
connection commissioner for Carroll
County

02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
County
 
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
um it's really just a replay of my prior
 
02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:43.850 align:start position:0%
um it's really just a replay of my prior
testimony

02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:07:45.410 --> 02:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
um the only difference is this actually
 
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
is a hunting bill this is very specific
 
02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.310 align:start position:0%
is a hunting bill this is very specific
very

02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
tree stands are used primarily by
 
02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.450 align:start position:0%
tree stands are used primarily by
hunters

02:07:52.450 --> 02:07:52.460 align:start position:0%
hunters
 
02:07:55.129 --> 02:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
but all the other issues really stand
 
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
and the commission is dedicated
 
02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
to increasing and maintaining public
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
access wherever we can so we have full
 
02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and much like the
 
02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
prior one we worked very hard with the
 
02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.250 align:start position:0%
prior one we worked very hard with the
stakeholders

02:08:09.250 --> 02:08:09.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
to to make this a very workable bill and
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
we would very much appreciate your
 
02:08:15.599 --> 02:08:17.390 align:start position:0%
we would very much appreciate your
support

02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you any new questions
 
02:08:22.729 --> 02:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
representative yeah you know I just I
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
have a just a question I'm
 
02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
it's this is really a sort of a language
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
question it says in paragraph four
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
except for permissions granted by
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
in paragraphs five and six and then it
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
goes on and it goes on to say that the
 
02:08:43.490 --> 02:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
permittee has to carry the permit
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
um with him and and display it if asked
 
02:08:49.490 --> 02:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
to do so uh by a conservation officer
 
02:08:52.370 --> 02:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
and I guess my question is this so it
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
says except for permissions in paragraph
 
02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
five and six five talks about permanent
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
tree stands or or or observation blinds
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
and six talks about temporary tree
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
stands or observation blinds so my
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
question is what if those two are
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
accepted from the requirement of having
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
a your permit with you what ones
 
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
are you required to have your permit
 
02:09:22.729 --> 02:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
with you uh I think you're this is the
 
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
amended as amended by the house
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh I believe so the latest version is
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
the latest version yes
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I really can't speak to that um that
 
02:09:35.330 --> 02:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
was not in the original Bill and um I
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the logic for that
 
02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.030 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the logic for that
language

02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
um as it was amended
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
okay I mean so perhaps okay perhaps um
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll save that for the current
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay sure all right bye any further
 
02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:48.589 align:start position:0%
okay sure all right bye any further
questions

02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:09:51.729 --> 02:09:51.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.570 --> 02:10:04.580 align:start position:0%
hello again I'll be incredibly brief
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Federation fully supports this
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
bill if you're placing a piece of
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
property you're something on somebody
 
02:10:10.609 --> 02:10:10.619 align:start position:0%
else's property you should put your name
 
02:10:12.770 --> 02:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
and contact information on it so
 
02:10:16.970 --> 02:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go relatively quickly through
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
these Witnesses so if you do have a
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
question please don't be shy and let me
 
02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.270 align:start position:0%
question please don't be shy and let me
know

02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes Anna Mark Davis
 
02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:35.629 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes Anna Mark Davis
again

02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again I'm still Ann Davis I
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
still own 500 Acres next to the John F
 
02:10:44.109 --> 02:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
Gile Memorial State Forest
 
02:10:47.629 --> 02:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
we had an experience about four years
 
02:10:49.729 --> 02:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
ago with a fellow who had a tree stand
 
02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
right next to one of our Trails it was
 
02:10:54.189 --> 02:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
not marked
 
02:10:58.070 --> 02:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh and I put a note on the tree stands
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
please contact me we're not comfortable
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
having you have this tree stand here he
 
02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
finally did call me back he said well
 
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
this is really good location because a
 
02:11:11.810 --> 02:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
lot of game comes down this trail and I
 
02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
said yes I realized that but I'm not
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it would you please
 
02:11:19.729 --> 02:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
move it so my suggestion is and I
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
support this bill because it would give
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
a landowners and Hunters an opportunity
 
02:11:28.490 --> 02:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
to sort this out before they were
 
02:11:31.209 --> 02:11:31.219 align:start position:0%
already set up for the season
 
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
and we've had a good relationship since
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
then even though he was a little
 
02:11:39.850 --> 02:11:39.860 align:start position:0%
reluctant to to move the tree stand so
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh the other component is uh he did put
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
the stand it was a temporary stand it
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
didn't have any uh damage to the tree
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
that he used
 
02:11:56.330 --> 02:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
but I just think it would be prudent to
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
give us all a chance to have a another
 
02:12:02.089 --> 02:12:02.099 align:start position:0%
conversation and a contact with the
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
hunting community and I think that would
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
help facilitate this thank you for the
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity and thank you for your
 
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
service on our behalf to the state
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for sharing with us
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming
 
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
yeah no one spoke up so nope
 
02:12:27.669 --> 02:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.649 --> 02:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just briefly I want to
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for allowing us to
 
02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
come down and speak uh
 
02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
both my wife and I support Senate Bill
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
15 also is written and I would just like
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
to uh emphasize one thing about the
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
relationship that we as landowners have
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
had over the years with the New
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game and in particular
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
with the colonel
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
Jordan and other members of his staff
 
02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
have been incredibly helpful to us in
 
02:13:05.569 --> 02:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
various things from hunting fishing and
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
vandalism and we thank them for the
 
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
service that they provide thank you all
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%

02:13:27.970 --> 02:13:27.980 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
thanks I think I pretty much covered
 
02:13:34.550 --> 02:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
you said this is the culmination of a
 
02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
frustration of a number of years and my
 
02:13:41.870 --> 02:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
my issue has been in the past is I'd
 
02:13:45.890 --> 02:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
come across a stand is it abandoned and
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
I left
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
flagging with my name another never
 
02:13:52.729 --> 02:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
occurred from these people and so that's
 
02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
been frustrating just to to establish a
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
dialogue and the other thing is it's
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
frustrating to have trees damaged so I
 
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
think it's a simple resolution put your
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
name on it and get permission thanks
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.729 --> 02:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
Jason stock with the New Hampshire
 
02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
Timberland Owners Association we support
 
02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
the bill we think it's for all the
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
reasons you just heard and I'd be happy
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
real quick just for the committee could
 
02:14:51.290 --> 02:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
you tell us the potential damage or or
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
monetary value of a uh we heard a
 
02:14:56.330 --> 02:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
testimony before of a near-grade piece
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
of Timber how much could that cost the
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
landowner by somebody putting screws
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
into it or strapping it too tight
 
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it a veneer grade log is I
 
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
mean you can be talking hundreds of
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
dollars if it's a veneer a single log a
 
02:15:13.330 --> 02:15:13.340 align:start position:0%
single veneer grade log
 
02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with portable tree
 
02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
stands as opposed to permanent where
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
you're putting screws in that you know
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's already covered in law but even
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
with a portable if you leave a stand on
 
02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
with a portable if you leave a stand on
um

02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:28.250 --> 02:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know and if there's a chain the tree
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
will actually grow around it and of
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
course that log is no longer useful so
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
even Portables if they're left up for
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
extended periods of time can damage
 
02:15:37.679 --> 02:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
extended periods of time can damage
trees

02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
trees
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
so yeah you're talking hundreds of
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
02:15:53.209 --> 02:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.810 --> 02:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Echo Jason's testimony and
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
and give you a couple of quick examples
 
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh I support both this bill and the last
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill as well obviously uh I was the one
 
02:16:13.970 --> 02:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
to mention the veneer grade Oak that was
 
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
a situation where Chris McKee again that
 
02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
officer he had to go
 
02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
running around uh there's a number of
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
Oaks back there where people have been
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
putting stands up and he had to go
 
02:16:25.609 --> 02:16:25.619 align:start position:0%
running up and down the street knocking
 
02:16:27.050 --> 02:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
on doors to try to figure out who it was
 
02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh because of it was just off a property
 
02:16:32.089 --> 02:16:32.099 align:start position:0%
where there's a development that's a
 
02:16:33.410 --> 02:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
waste of their time if there had been a
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
name on there we could have easily just
 
02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
called them
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
second situation was one where the
 
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
person does put there I mean we have
 
02:16:41.089 --> 02:16:41.099 align:start position:0%
some good people in our area they put
 
02:16:42.290 --> 02:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
their name and number on the tree stand
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
knew who it was gave him a ring it gave
 
02:16:48.169 --> 02:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
me a chance to educate them about the
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
value of the Timber
 
02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
that they didn't know about they didn't
 
02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
know they'd stuck it on a high-grade
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
sugar maple and
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
we have a great relationship that was 10
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
or 12 years ago
 
02:17:02.330 --> 02:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
and they hunt my property now
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
again like I said in the first bill this
 
02:17:06.169 --> 02:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
is cooperation this is about respective
 
02:17:07.610 --> 02:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
private property
 
02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
so please pass this bill unchanged
 
02:17:13.250 --> 02:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
and just move on
 
02:17:16.730 --> 02:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
the chair calls um
 
02:17:25.849 --> 02:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.650 --> 02:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
Kevin Jordan again a chief of law
 
02:17:28.849 --> 02:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
enforcement New Hampshire fishing game
 
02:17:31.370 --> 02:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
and thanks again for entertaining us and
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for all the trouble
 
02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:34.610 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for all the trouble
um

02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh another really good question I wish
 
02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
you to stay at home today quite frankly
 
02:17:41.929 --> 02:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to try to explain what
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
how that came about so the original Law
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
20736a I believe it is for tree stands
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
requires today if you would have put up
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
a permanent tree stand a permanent tree
 
02:17:55.969 --> 02:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
stand is any tree stand that does damage
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
to property or could potentially do that
 
02:18:00.589 --> 02:18:00.599 align:start position:0%
or anything that you insert into a tree
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
so screwed in steps cutting tree
 
02:18:05.209 --> 02:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
branches so I have a clear shot with a
 
02:18:05.219 --> 02:18:06.709 align:start position:0%
branches so I have a clear shot with a
bow

02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
bow
 
02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
um I built one where you're nailing it
 
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
to the tree any of those types of stands
 
02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
require written landowner permission and
 
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
you have to have that permission with
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
you that was created a number of years
 
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
ago and we enforced that today if you
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
hunt and stands like I use which are
 
02:18:21.479 --> 02:18:23.330 align:start position:0%
hunt and stands like I use which are
climbers

02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
climbers
 
02:18:24.530 --> 02:18:24.540 align:start position:0%
um and if you're not familiar with those
 
02:18:26.089 --> 02:18:26.099 align:start position:0%
there are cables that go around a tree
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
they're portable you can you know very
 
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
light you can drag them in with you when
 
02:18:31.009 --> 02:18:31.019 align:start position:0%
you're ready to hunt and you climb the
 
02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
tree using the stand it doesn't do any
 
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
damage other than scratching the bark
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
going up but doesn't insert anything
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
into the tree and you'd remove it at the
 
02:18:40.310 --> 02:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
end of the day there's no requirement
 
02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
for written landowner permission for
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
that we still encourage Hunters to go to
 
02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
the landowner and ask that you know
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
permission to do it but there's not a
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
requirement for a permit
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
so then again going back to my original
 
02:18:56.929 --> 02:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
with the camera the same similar calls
 
02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
from landowners every fall they don't
 
02:19:00.169 --> 02:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
know who these people are these stands
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
are up they didn't ask on permission so
 
02:19:03.709 --> 02:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
we were trying to address both these
 
02:19:05.929 --> 02:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
issues last year we tried to address it
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
it kind of got it went sideways because
 
02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
the two bills were attached together
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
they were amended multiple times and it
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
became a real mess and the house finally
 
02:19:17.389 --> 02:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
said and I think correctly we can't pass
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
this so this year I separated those two
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I wrote a camera Bill and then I
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
wrote a tree stand bill so the tree
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
stand bill in an effort to balance as
 
02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
I've said before the rights of a
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
landowner and and the ability for sports
 
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
men and women to hunt
 
02:19:33.169 --> 02:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
we put in some caveats in this which
 
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
ended up I think making a little bit
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
confusing so
 
02:19:41.209 --> 02:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
um the goal here is to allow the use of
 
02:19:42.889 --> 02:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
stands just like we always did not
 
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
change the permanent stands so a
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
landowner still has to give permission
 
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
for that and we went a step further in
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
saying that if you one other problem
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
that I get or call that I get from
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
landowners is z stands go in and they
 
02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
stay up permanently and the reason they
 
02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
stay up permanently is because Hunters
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
have a good spot and they don't want
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
someone else to move in there so they
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
leave their stands up frankly they'll
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
give you 100 excuses but the fact of the
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
matter is they'll leave their stand up
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
because they want me when I come in as a
 
02:20:09.530 --> 02:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
hunter to see if there's already a tree
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
stand there and go somewhere else and so
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
they end up leaving these stands up
 
02:20:15.650 --> 02:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
claiming their property claiming their
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
their special spot a lot of landowners
 
02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
don't like that obviously so I didn't
 
02:20:22.849 --> 02:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
want to take that away from a hunter if
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do it and the landowner
 
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't care I hunt on property the
 
02:20:28.849 --> 02:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
landowner doesn't care if I leave it up
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
he says you can leave it up all year for
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
all I care as long as you're not hurting
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
my property so we wrote this bill to
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
allow for both so what we said was you
 
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
have to you you can only put them in in
 
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
that time frame between August 31st and
 
02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:45.500 align:start position:0%
December 31st of each calendar year
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
unless and it has to be removed I put
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
January 1st every year it got amended in
 
02:20:53.929 --> 02:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
the house to April 1st and I I it
 
02:20:55.610 --> 02:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
escapes me why that happened but I'm
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
um unless you get permission from the
 
02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
landowner it says I don't care and then
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
you can leave it up so it gives both the
 
02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
Sportsman in my opinion it gives the
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
Sportsman the right the ability to to do
 
02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
just what they're doing today with
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
permission and it gives a landowner to
 
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
say no I don't want that I want it
 
02:21:15.290 --> 02:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
removed it was I was trying to balance
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
both and so the paragraph that you're
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
asking about Sir is except for
 
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
permission granted by property owner in
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
paragraph five and six we didn't require
 
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
it this is where it's a little confusing
 
02:21:29.090 --> 02:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
I didn't require it in writing
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
so a permanent tree stand you have to
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
get it in writing from the landowner
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Roy would have to sign
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
his name saying it gives Kevin Jordan
 
02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
permission to hunt we didn't ask for
 
02:21:40.849 --> 02:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
written permission for all these other
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
things and I'll tell you why I didn't do
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
that is my experience as a hunter and as
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
a game warden landowners are very
 
02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
hesitant to sign their name to something
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
that says I'm going to allow you to
 
02:21:53.809 --> 02:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
climb a tree on my property even though
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
we have good liability laws on the books
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they've been tested in a case in
 
02:22:01.070 --> 02:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
Deerfield recently where a landowner is
 
02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
protected against liability if a hunter
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
gets hurt on their property there are a
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
number of landowners who will tell you
 
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
including the one I hunt on I'm not
 
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
signing anything I'll give you
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
permission but I'm not signing anything
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
and so I was concerned about that that
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
we'd put hunters in a position where a
 
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
landowner really didn't care that that
 
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
they were on their property but they
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
didn't want to sign it and so I said
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
just get permission and and you'll
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
notice the word written is excluded and
 
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for that so how this
 
02:22:30.290 --> 02:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
would work I would encounter Hunter
 
02:22:31.969 --> 02:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
Jason stock hunting on a piece of
 
02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
property I would say to Jason
 
02:22:35.090 --> 02:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
you have permission to have that tree
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
stand here yes I do I went to I went to
 
02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
Rob Johnson the landowner and he gave me
 
02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
permission to do that I can check on
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
that I can call Rob Johnson if I want to
 
02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
do that and find out if he gave him
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
permission I don't need something in
 
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
writing if I required it to be in
 
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
writing Rob Johnson might tell him no
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to sign it and then he
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
can't hunt on it so that's kind of the
 
02:22:55.610 --> 02:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
reason we did that so we're saying in
 
02:22:58.370 --> 02:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
that paragraph except as required in
 
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
five and six which is that special
 
02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:02.210 align:start position:0%
five and six which is that special
permission

02:23:02.210 --> 02:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
you have to carry that written
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
permission from the former law that says
 
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
that you are okay to have a permanent
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
stand is that did I clear that up or did
 
02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
I confuse you more
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
you confused me more that's the intent
 
02:23:18.770 --> 02:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
of it if you if you have a better way to
 
02:23:21.050 --> 02:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
write it I'm all he is but that's the
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
intent we we were trying to balance we
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
didn't want to change the prior law we
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
think it's a good law but we didn't want
 
02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
to require landowners to sign something
 
02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to sign or they were
 
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
they were leery of signing I've had many
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
conversational landowners saying if you
 
02:23:36.530 --> 02:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
allow people on your land if you allow a
 
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
snow machine Trail ATV trailer or tree
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
stand and a sports man or woman get
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
injured you're not liable but we live in
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
a world where we all know
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it costs money to prove that
 
02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
you're innocent and and as long I'm
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
being sued I think I've got four
 
02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
lawsuits pending on me currently it's
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
pretty common for anybody that does
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
anything in this business you get sued
 
02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
and and I'm being sued in one case where
 
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
I followed the law to the letter and I'm
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
still being sued it costs money to prove
 
02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
that you're innocent so I didn't want to
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
put a landowner in that position I
 
02:24:08.270 --> 02:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
wanted I didn't want a hunter to not
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to hunt a piece of
 
02:24:10.910 --> 02:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
property because a landowner was
 
02:24:13.250 --> 02:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
concerned about signing something so we
 
02:24:15.410 --> 02:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
we wrote it in this fashion requires you
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
to get the permission but it's not in
 
02:24:19.130 --> 02:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
writing that could be used against the
 
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
landowner later
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:23.809 align:start position:0%
the other
um

02:24:23.809 --> 02:24:23.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh the Senate May amend this when it
 
02:24:29.210 --> 02:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
goes back because they are concerned
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
about turkey stands in the spring which
 
02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
I didn't give any thought to
 
02:24:35.809 --> 02:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
so we may have to go back to that date
 
02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
of January 1 for the removal to allow
 
02:24:39.530 --> 02:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
people to put them up in the spring but
 
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let the Senate decide that
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
that isn't in this version so the the
 
02:24:48.250 --> 02:24:48.260 align:start position:0%
the January 1
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
date change I did I may have some
 
02:24:54.530 --> 02:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility I
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much sir I was
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
concerned uh about elderly Hunters being
 
02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
out there in December in two feet of
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
snow right trying to get a metal street
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
I was worried about heart attacks
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
falling yep I said what's the problem
 
02:25:07.849 --> 02:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
waiting another couple months till the
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
ground is safe yeah um so I would I
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
would concern I'd have similar concerns
 
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
about a turkey stand first of all I
 
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
didn't know people didn't just well so
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
at my point to the senator to Senator
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
Pearl is a friend of mine I said I don't
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
know how that it makes a difference on a
 
02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
on a stand or blind for turkey but I
 
02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
didn't want to interfere with that I
 
02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a scenario where
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
you interfere with that so I was open
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
for that discussion and actually that
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
idea was presented to me by chairman
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
splane about the wintertime thing and we
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
conceded to allow the April
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um I try to make it simple for Folk
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
because I my experience has been the
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
more simple you may get the less
 
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
violations you get so if you say they're
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
going to be out by December 31st or
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
January 1st people remember that they
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
can remember April 1st too so it doesn't
 
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
matter as long as it's clear I think and
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
remember they can get permission and
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
none of that applies they can they go to
 
02:26:00.590 --> 02:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
landowner that doesn't care then all of
 
02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
that is null and void it's just making
 
02:26:04.730 --> 02:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
them go to the landowner is the goal
 
02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:06.650 align:start position:0%
them go to the landowner is the goal
here

02:26:06.650 --> 02:26:06.660 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative Newman just a quick
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
question so the the person that has that
 
02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
if they want them off as a specific date
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
if they're going to give permission to
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
someone they could put any date that
 
02:26:20.929 --> 02:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
they want they could put anything they
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
want it's their land yep if this is
 
02:26:25.490 --> 02:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
absent a date or absent permission it
 
02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
would have to be that way yes landowner
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
reserves that right to do whatever they
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
want I'm not sure it's this bill at a
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
previous bill it says that your
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
department is going to create a form
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
um for the permission I think it was
 
02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's this one which we have already for
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
the permanent stand so we have one and
 
02:26:44.090 --> 02:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
that form allows for any date to be put
 
02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
it does okay yes yeah it's just
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
landowners are very I don't know if you
 
02:26:49.730 --> 02:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
found that but landowners are very
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
nervous about signing their names and I
 
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
understand that yeah so we left this
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
provision in so they wouldn't have to if
 
02:26:58.250 --> 02:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
they chose not to
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn did you need some
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
further clarification on that or so I I
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
well I guess I I you know I don't want I
 
02:27:07.849 --> 02:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
my my former job used to be to be a
 
02:27:10.130 --> 02:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
nitpicker so that's why I'm knitting I
 
02:27:11.929 --> 02:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
would have called you a judge I think a
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
judge so here's what I'm am I
 
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
understanding then
 
02:27:19.969 --> 02:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
that you don't need to have
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
a permit that you carry with you
 
02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
if you if you construct a permanent tree
 
02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
stand with permission that doesn't have
 
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
to be per written permission
 
02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:35.090 align:start position:0%
to be per written permission
um

02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
but that tree stand cannot damage the
 
02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
tree because if it does if it is going
 
02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
to damage the tree then you have to have
 
02:27:43.490 --> 02:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
written permission that's correct okay
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
except you called it in the first part
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
of it a permanent so it really wouldn't
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
be a permanent one well but see that
 
02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
that's where I have a problem because in
 
02:27:56.410 --> 02:27:56.420 align:start position:0%
paragraph one it talks about uh
 
02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:58.010 align:start position:0%
paragraph one it talks about uh
shall

02:27:58.010 --> 02:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
shall
 
02:27:59.570 --> 02:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
um that's the original Law yep that's
 
02:28:00.889 --> 02:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
the original Law and that talks about it
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
whether it damages a tree that's correct
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
and that's true for that you need
 
02:28:05.570 --> 02:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
written permission that's correct and
 
02:28:07.330 --> 02:28:07.340 align:start position:0%
you have to carry that on your purse
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
button paragraph five also talks about a
 
02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
permanent tree stand and that doesn't
 
02:28:16.010 --> 02:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
require written permission it does and
 
02:28:18.530 --> 02:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
it and it doesn't describe the same
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
detail as the paragraph one up above
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're right so I that could have been
 
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
eliminated quite frankly I'm not sure
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
how that got put in there but that
 
02:28:29.090 --> 02:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
particular line could have been
 
02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
eliminated I think we're on the same
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
page you and I okay I think I think you
 
02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
understand what I what we're trying to
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
do here but it would be helpful if that
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
first line that number five really
 
02:28:42.889 --> 02:28:42.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be there
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
I hate to see it go back to another
 
02:28:44.399 --> 02:28:45.590 align:start position:0%
I hate to see it go back to another
committee

02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
because I worry every time this goes
 
02:28:50.570 --> 02:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
before a committee but
 
02:28:53.809 --> 02:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
yeah we could um we could if the
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
Senate's intending to work on it anyway
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
just let them do that I can ask Howard
 
02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
the senator Pearl to do that yeah okay
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
yeah any further questions
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
much sir is there anyone here wishing to
 
02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
testify in sb15 who did not submit a
 
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
card and wishes to do so
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none here I close the public
 
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
hearing on SB 15 and we are going to
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
and I will make a motion of
 
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
ought to pass

gathright
 
02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to my motion I think we've
 
02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
heard plenty of testimony today I'm a
 
02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
Hunter I watch out for Hunter's rights
 
02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm part of the reason the bill failed
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
last year because somehow between all
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
the Committees and the two two different
 
02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
bodies it in my opinion ended up to be a
 
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
mess this is much cleaner it protects
 
02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
landowners protects Hunters I think it
 
02:29:57.469 --> 02:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
does what it sets out to do
 
02:30:00.830 --> 02:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
um so in the interest of keeping
 
02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
land available for hunters to hunt
 
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
I suggest that we pass this bill would
 
02:30:07.849 --> 02:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your second
 
02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Catherine
 
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think it was well set and I truly
 
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
enjoyed all the testimony from the
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners land owners tonight today so
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
it was quite interesting thank you
 
02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:25.929 align:start position:0%
it was quite interesting thank you
discussion

02:30:25.929 --> 02:30:25.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh just to address representative Lin's
 
02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:32.210 align:start position:0%
uh just to address representative Lin's
concerns

02:30:32.210 --> 02:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
um I understand that that being in the
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
law the penalty could apply to the
 
02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
landowner I mean the property owned as
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
well but I think it's talking about
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
forfeiting the game camera uh and
 
02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
fastening devices in the penalty section
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
kind of proves our intent that it's
 
02:30:50.270 --> 02:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
towards the game camera person as
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the property owner so that
 
02:30:55.130 --> 02:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral four about them contacting
 
02:30:56.809 --> 02:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement officer I don't
 
02:30:59.570 --> 02:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
think the penalty would apply to that
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
I think that if you had a literalist
 
02:31:03.770 --> 02:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
Justice it may
 
02:31:05.809 --> 02:31:05.819 align:start position:0%
um if you had one that bothered to look
 
02:31:07.969 --> 02:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
at the intent of the legislature that it
 
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
would not and are speaking about it
 
02:31:12.349 --> 02:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
right now we are making our intent known
 
02:31:12.359 --> 02:31:13.550 align:start position:0%
right now we are making our intent known
so

02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
penalties of
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
these and it's almost like it's just a
 
02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:25.969 align:start position:0%
these and it's almost like it's just a
license

02:31:25.969 --> 02:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:31:30.010 --> 02:31:30.020 align:start position:0%
fee as opposed to a real penalty
 
02:31:32.690 --> 02:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
125 dollars
 
02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
02:31:37.010 --> 02:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's a um
 
02:31:40.010 --> 02:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
I believe that they this was vetted um
 
02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty hard by uh of numerous
 
02:31:44.270 --> 02:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
different people on whether that was
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
enough it does go up to a thousand
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
dollars potentially for a violation and
 
02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
I think that they came to the conclusion
 
02:31:53.450 --> 02:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
that for a lot of people that hunt
 
02:31:56.450 --> 02:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily people of means
 
02:31:59.570 --> 02:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
and 125 dollars
 
02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I believe that they thought was
 
02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:02.809 align:start position:0%
um I believe that they thought was
enough

02:32:02.809 --> 02:32:02.819 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:32:04.969 --> 02:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
whether or not it is or not
 
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
um I guess time will tell they would
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
forfeit their equipment which is
 
02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably ends up being more than that in
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
the end
 
02:32:14.090 --> 02:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
and I am curious to know what Colonel
 
02:32:16.610 --> 02:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
Jordan is there other license
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.050 --> 02:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um as as we get older the the years we
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
have to hunt shrink and losing one of
 
02:32:53.090 --> 02:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
them is very valuable
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
um representative Newell
 
02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just add that one of the
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
things I really appreciate about this
 
02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
bill and the way that it's written is
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
that and you know you know what I think
 
02:33:03.889 --> 02:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
is reflected in a lot of the testimony
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
is that it's not meant to be
 
02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
um a stick it's meant to be a carrot
 
02:33:08.450 --> 02:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's meant to be something that is like
 
02:33:10.610 --> 02:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
or not a care but it it's meant to be
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
um uh a nudge and say hey uh let's be
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
courteous to each other and things like
 
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
that not necessarily if you do this then
 
02:33:21.290 --> 02:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not putting this properly but you
 
02:33:22.969 --> 02:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
get my point so I'll be voting in favor
 
02:33:25.370 --> 02:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
yeah it's um it's definitely educational
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
but it does have some teeth
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
any further comments representative
 
02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chair
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
um I'll be voting in support but I would
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
have liked to have seen a clause
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um whereby property owners could have
 
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.550 align:start position:0%
um whereby property owners could have
removed

02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
removed
 
02:33:42.889 --> 02:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
um the game cameras on their own with no
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
liability for damage to those cameras
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
um as those cameras are placed there
 
02:33:50.210 --> 02:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
without the permission of the property
 
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
owners but you know in I don't want to
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
throw away the the perfect for the good
 
02:33:56.809 --> 02:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
so absolutely I think it's a it's a um
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
obviously necessary and and um I'll be
 
02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
supporting this
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I I just to respond to that I
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
I I struggled with that a little bit too
 
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
but at the end from the criminal justice
 
02:34:10.910 --> 02:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee standpoint if a landowner
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
takes it down what they've done is
 
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
they've taken away the evidence of the
 
02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
crime so if you call the the fish and
 
02:34:19.610 --> 02:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
game to come out and say hey this person
 
02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
violated this law they put this camera
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
up without permission okay take me to it
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
well it's in my garage well they can't
 
02:34:28.610 --> 02:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
they can't prove the crime anymore so
 
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
and I really do take stock in what the
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
colonel said is avoiding confrontations
 
02:34:35.210 --> 02:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
with armed hunters in the middle of the
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
woods some of them who are not
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily as nice as we would hope and
 
02:34:41.809 --> 02:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
it can be very intimidating for I'd hate
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
to see a landowner get in that position
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
so I agree in my natural instinct says
 
02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
my property I can do what I want but
 
02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:50.090 align:start position:0%
my property I can do what I want but
unfortunately

02:34:50.090 --> 02:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of proving the crime
 
02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
and avoiding unnecessary tragedies I
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
think that it's best left that way but
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
you are free to Lobby to Senate
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
any further
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to ask the clerk

02:36:20.270 --> 02:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
I will speak to my motion everything I
 
02:36:24.889 --> 02:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
said previously still applies if not
 
02:36:27.530 --> 02:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
um it's not as onerous a tree stand
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
isn't as onerous as something capturing
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
pictures of you but nonetheless it is
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
your property it can damage your trees
 
02:36:37.490 --> 02:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
and it can be disconcerting to walk
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
through your woods and see a structure
 
02:36:42.610 --> 02:36:42.620 align:start position:0%

conversations and relationships between
 
02:36:58.490 --> 02:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
landowners and good hunters and that's
 
02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
what we want is the good hunters and if
 
02:37:03.290 --> 02:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
you're not a good Hunter and you're not
 
02:37:04.849 --> 02:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
