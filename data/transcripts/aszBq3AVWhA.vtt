injustice
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the new hampshire general court
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
passed a law requiring law enforcement
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
agencies to adopt a written policy on
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
eyewitness identification procedures
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
that conforms to the model policy issued
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
by the attorney general the innocence
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
project has attempted for years to
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
ensure uniformity of eyewitness
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
identification best practices across new
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's law enforcement agencies
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
we're grateful for the collaboration and
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
support that led to a model policy from
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office and the
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
completion of multiple trainings by law
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers however all of this
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
work in the absence of confirmation that
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
all departments across the state have
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
indeed adopted the model policy leave
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
citizens unnecessarily at risk of
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
wrongful conviction
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
hb 436 is needed to finally ensure every
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
citizen regardless of county can know
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement are conducting
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
proper i went eyewitness identifications
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
nationally there have been 375 dna
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
exonerations of which 69
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
involved eyewitness misidentification
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
many states include remedies in their
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
statutes that dictate consequences for
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
not following established policy
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
such as instruction to the jury that
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
they may consider the lack of compliance
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
with the policy in determining the
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
credibility of an identification or
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
instruction allowing a court to consider
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with the policy in
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
considering suppression of an
 
00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.470 align:start position:0%
considering suppression of an
identification

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
identification
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
a remedy was not included in new
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire's law initially because
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders agreed that law enforcement
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
agencies would adopt and follow policies
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
that comport with the core principles of
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
the model policy issued by the attorney
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
general's office however uniform
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
adoption of these policies has not
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
happened in years have passed leaving
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rates unnecessarily at
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
risk details of efforts to conform adopt
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
confirm adoption of the policy can be
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
found in my written comments along with
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
further details on the national
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
landscape of eyewitness identification
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
reform we urge you to pass hb 436 which
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
will assure uniform justice across the
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
i notice in here we have a change that
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
talks about the enforcement manual
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
pertaining to partial identification
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
current as of january 1st 2019
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'm always concerned about putting
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
a manual state because they always get
 
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
a manual state because they always get
updated

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
is this a good idea to put
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the manual
 
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
of the manual
or

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for that question i
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
understand your concern and the reason
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
that i think it's a good idea to put the
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
date is because that current version
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
which actually is an update from when
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
when the law passed to your point
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
exactly that the the manual was updated
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
the eyewitness identification procedures
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
that are outlined in the
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
dated manual in this law
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
conform to what is
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
widely accepted to be the best practices
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
for eyewitness identification reform so
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
right now there's what's called the core
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
four reforms which are reforms that we
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
know if these simple reforms are
 
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.430 align:start position:0%
know if these simple reforms are
completed

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
um help to ensure that misidentification
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so right now the date that you see
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
in that law that particular policy
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
we know that the core for and what is
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
the sound accepted science is reflected
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
in that policy so that's why i think it
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
does make sense to include that date now
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
if for some reason we needed to update
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
it in the future i think that's a
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
conversation that could happen but right
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
now if they were continuing to follow
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
that policy and that date we would be in
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
in really great shape
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative harper thank you mr chair
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
substantively it seems like the only
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
real change is uh
 
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.829 align:start position:0%
real change is uh
um

00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
changing the words from they
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
to such lineups
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
they seem to quite clearly refer to
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
lineups i don't understand
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
what has transpired
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
since this bill was enacted or an event
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
that happened
that

00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
you that we find this necessary to vote
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
on this today or to
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
consider this today
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
sure so i'm not
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry would you like me to answer
 
00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:10.069 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry would you like me to answer
that

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure uh the version
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at but there is an
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
inclusion of a new section that allows
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
for remedies
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
if the policies are not enacted so i do
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
believe there's further to the change of
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i thank the
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
witness for taking my question
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
under the remedies
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh number two
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
the court may consider the failure to
 
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.389 align:start position:0%
the court may consider the failure to
comply

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
comply
 
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
comply
as

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
of this chapter as grounds for
 
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.150 align:start position:0%
of this chapter as grounds for
suppression

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
can't the court right now
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
consider that as grounds for suppression
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i'm going to leave that
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
question for uh another witness coming
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
up professor sure who is uh has
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
practiced under this i don't want to
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
speak to that i know that that is not
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated in the law right now
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
so i know that that is not currently
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
a stated option but i'm gonna defer to
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
him on you know what the court is
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
allowed to do in their discretion what i
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
would say is this makes it explicitly
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
clear that a jury instruction is to
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
happen and that this can be grounds for
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
suppression but i'd prefer to to defer
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
to him as someone who practices in the
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
state if that's all right with you
 
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative muse you recognized for a
 
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.189 align:start position:0%
representative muse you recognized for a
question

00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
um can you refresh us um
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
why the remedies that are present in
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
this bill weren't included in the
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
original legislation i wasn't here in
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
2018 and i'm just curious what the
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
background is on that oh of course thank
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
you so much i wasn't here either but my
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
organization was
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues were and i'm up to
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
speed on it and actually some of the
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
folks you'll hear from later were here
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
and some of you were here because this
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
committee uh supported uh supported this
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
committee uh supported uh supported this
bill

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
bill
so

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
this is an effort that we actually
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
started almost seven years ago
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
um trying to ensure that eyewitness
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
identification procedures were uniform
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
across the state and just a reminder on
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
the importance of that i know i said
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
this in my comments but of our dna
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
exoneration so people that we're able to
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
exonerate with dna we're able to see
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
other contributing factors when we have
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
an exoneration and 69 of those had a
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
misidentification that's really huge the
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
fact that people who were exonerated
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
through dna later were shown to also
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
have been misidentified
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
really is very telling and shows us that
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
this is something that we need to be
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
ensuring best practice so we're
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
preventing this from ever happening so
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
what we did was we began working with
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office and
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
working with stakeholders in new
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire to say what do we need to do
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
to get a model policy in place and to
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
their credit the attorney general
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
issued a model policy in 2015 and it
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
really captures what we call i already
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
said this the core four it captures
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
these best practices and my
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the understanding
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
of of us and of uh the attorney
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
general's office and of the stakeholders
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
who were involved at the time
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
was that uh including the new hampshire
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
police chiefs association who deserve a
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
lot of credit and have done a lot of
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
training on the policy is that a more
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
prescriptive bill laying out
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
the remedies would be filed later if we
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
weren't able to ensure everyone adopted
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
it but we had sort of the word of
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
everyone involved that this will be done
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
everyone will adopt this everyone will
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
be using these best practices and that's
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
what's important to us what's important
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
is that this is these best practices are
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
followed everywhere in the state um and
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
that is what has not happened and we've
 
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.190 align:start position:0%
that is what has not happened and we've
really

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
tried to run this information down to
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
find out where is this happening ask the
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general please confirm that
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
everyone has adopted this policy and
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
that is what we have not been able to do
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
over the past few years and i detail
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
that more in the written comments um but
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's why we're here today
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
because we have not been able to confirm
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
that everyone is using this best
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
practice that really does prevent
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
wrongful conviction
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
follow it please please
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
represent muse
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it the remedies that
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
are laid out in this bill
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
really won't have any impact on the vast
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
majority of uh police departments that
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
are following the policy now oh that's
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
exactly right for the departments who
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
are already following the policy they're
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
already following the policy so that's
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right and what we're
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
concerned with is ensuring that that
 
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
everyone is so that if someone in one
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
county happens to be arrested there's
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
much less risk of them being exposed to
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
a you know outdated practice that puts
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
them at risk of wrongful conviction we
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
want to sure ensure everyone is
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
following this policy
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know hands raised
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the witness for a
 
00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.270 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the witness for a
testimony

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%

that the
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
young lady of the innocence project
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
say i agree uh with
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative testerman in his question
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
regarding placing the date inside the
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
statute i personally believe it's a
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
mistake for one there was not an
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general's law enforcement
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
manual written in january of 2019 the
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
newest manual came out in november of
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
2020 prior to that it was 2008 prior to
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
that 1993 prior to that 1984 i can go on
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
but you see they're spaced out by
 
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.350 align:start position:0%
but you see they're spaced out by
decades

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
decades
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i testified in front of i believe it
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
was this committee i'm not saying
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
members in roughly 2018 when the bill
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
was first proposed and our agency was
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
100 behind it so i i just want to give
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
you a perspective
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
in april of 2015 the attorney general
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
sent out a memorandum saying this is the
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
newest best practice for eyewitness
 
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:45.669 align:start position:0%
newest best practice for eyewitness
identification

00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
identification
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
within months
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
we immediately we began to transition
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
and within months the entire agency uh
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
had transitioned to the newest best
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
practice that was 2015.
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
three years later i was testifying to
 
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
three years later i was testifying to
say

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
codifying a procedure a best practice
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
procedure handcuffs us pardon the pun
 
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
procedure handcuffs us pardon the pun
because

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
when the newest best practice comes out
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
we have to come before you again to
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
amend the legislation so i believe the
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
statute that you did pass in 2019 um and
 
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
statute that you did pass in 2019 um and
it

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
that attorney general's memorandum in
 
00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
that attorney general's memorandum in
2015

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
2015
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
didn't make the manual until 2020 it
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
took five years but as soon as the
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
memorandum hit coming from the attorney
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
general the chief law enforcement
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
officer in the state we immediately
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
transition uh secondly i know you'll
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
probably hear i'm assuming you'll hear
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
from many attorneys i'm not an attorney
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
but i've been doing this for two decades
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i've spoken to many attorneys this
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
bill is looking to place remedies
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
in case um these measures not followed
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen the committee in my
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
humble opinion that i have attorneys
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
agreeing with me
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
this occurs every day in every court
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
across the nation eyewitness
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
identification is a piece of evidence
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
along with physical evidence dna
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
evidence witness victim suspect
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
statements i can go on and on if they're
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
not obtained properly the judge can
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
place different amounts of weight or
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
make them inadmissible the judge also at
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
trial turns to the jury and
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
explains to them how much weight that
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
they can or can't give a piece of
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
evidence i've witnessed i've been taught
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
this and i've witnessed it
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
dozens if not hundreds of times so i
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
personally believe the law we have is
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
good i'm behind the innocence project
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
where far as far as this is the best
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
practice we're adhering to it and have
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
been since 2015 and i don't think we
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
need more laws in this uh scheme i think
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
we need more education training and
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
funding for law enforcement so that we
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
can have positive and ethical outcomes i
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
will entertain any questions thank you
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you miss mr justified uh the chair
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
would ask a question and i want to thank
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
can questions

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
can questions
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
can you explain how many of the police
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
departments have adopted or
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
or are currently following the best
 
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:02.310 align:start position:0%
or are currently following the best
practices

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marston thank
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
so as i understand that
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
what you are saying
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
is that this this piece of legislation
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
is not needed because it's redundant we
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
already have it on the books
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
precisely sir
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
anybody this may ask a follow-up
 
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.310 align:start position:0%
anybody this may ask a follow-up
question

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
from the chair and
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my follow-up
 
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my follow-up
questions

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
questions
so

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
i guess my question would be how how
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
would we
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
how would the departments be required to
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
actually adopt the best practices if
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's not within the law
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
mr chair that's an excellent question
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
and my answer is this
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you step away from what we're talking
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
about today with eyewitness and and pick
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
any other pick dna evidence pick a
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
statement because they've been
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
conducting interviews for hundreds of
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
years if we do not adhere to the law the
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
best practice nashua's accredited 459

555 page roughly attorney general's
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%

00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence that's contrary to any
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
of those documents in my training a
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
judge can
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
if he or she deems it appropriate put
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
less weight on the evidence or make them
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
non-admissible in and of themselves
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
i hope that answered your question
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
thank you

if i'm reading the bill correctly
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's really only one well other than
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
the date change
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
to such lineups
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
i guess i i'm confused do you know what
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
that means you know what would be the
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
difference from they to such lineups and
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
having not crafted it my opinion when i
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
read it is that they wanted to be more
 
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.710 align:start position:0%
read it is that they wanted to be more
specific

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
and they might have been too vague for
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
the drafters liking um i don't think
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
that line
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
the way i read it would affect us as i
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
said and i agree with you sir the date i
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
believe could be problematic because it
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow us to fluently transition
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
to the best practice and i think that
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
the remedies are redundant
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
officer for taking my question
 
00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.390 align:start position:0%
officer for taking my question
um

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your service to our
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
state i just want to know because
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
another representative asked you if you
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
know if this was being followed best
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
practices on in the other police
 
00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:14.230 align:start position:0%
practices on in the other police
departments

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
is and you and i i heard that you didn't
 
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.789 align:start position:0%
is and you and i i heard that you didn't
know

00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
now with that data being missing how can
 
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.029 align:start position:0%
now with that data being missing how can
we

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
make it our responsibility and hold the
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
state accountable to best practices
 
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.110 align:start position:0%
state accountable to best practices
everywhere

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative i understand your
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
question and that's why my example
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
before was
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
the attorney general said a memorandum
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
if an agency reads the memorandum and
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
says we don't agree we don't think
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's best practice we are not going to
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
use it
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
any defense lawyer any prosecutor seeing
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we are that that agency or that
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
officer was not using the best practice
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
will come up in court which is how the
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
system is set up that would in my
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
opinion be evidence because an
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
eyewitness identification as evidence
 
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
eyewitness identification as evidence
obtained

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
obtained
 
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
obtained
um

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say illegally but at the
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
very very least inappropriately
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
contrary to best practice contrary to
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
the opinion of the attorney general and
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
having seen how it works firsthand i
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be shocked if a judge said yeah
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's no big deal we're going to allow
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
it in because i've sat through these
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
procedures where if we don't if we're
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to do a b and c to
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
recover a knife used in an assault and i
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
skip over point b that knife might not
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
make it in
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
and that's a huge
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
that this is such a huge risk to ignore
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
the attorney general when they come out
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
with a memorandum and that's why i gave
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
the example
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
the memorandum came out in april it hit
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
my desk in may
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
we immediately transitioned the
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
detective bureau i have our standard
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
operating procedure in front of me i
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually testified before the committee
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
and brought all these documents emails i
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
sent out department wide i'm just not
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
able to say which agencies automatically
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
adhered but if they
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know how their evidence and
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
their identifications are ever going to
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
see the light of day in court
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up chair
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative knight you're recognized
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
um are these best practices defined in
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
our law or are they
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
like you're saying they're made up
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
per department when you get the standard
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
operating procedure that you just
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
told us about
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
is that law
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
to my understanding it's not law the law
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
well i'm gonna backtrack on that the law
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
says we have to follow the attorney
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
general's protocol the attorney
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
general's protocol spells out step by
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
step what the procedure is
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you deviate from that you're not
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
following the ag's procedure
 
00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:53.350 align:start position:0%
following the ag's procedure
therefore

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
in court that could be shown that it was
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
not that's not a proper piece of
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
evidence it wasn't obtained
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh properly if i answered your question
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
sorry uh third follow-up if i may
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
represent tonight
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
we do have to limit members to
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
two questions each uh per week
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
he's not
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for the
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
witness for taking the question
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
um is is your concern about the way that
 
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.710 align:start position:0%
um is is your concern about the way that
this

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
law is
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is currently written
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
a function of the date
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
or is it a function of the inclusion of
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
the set the new section about remedies
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
that's my question
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
so the date i believe is problematic for
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
the reasons i stated before as far as um
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
impeding future best practices that come
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
out uh if
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
if if we had it codified back in 2015
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
if we waited for the law in 2015 when
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
the manual when the uh
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
memo came out we would have waited three
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
years to transition to the standard
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
instead of doing it immediately my
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
problem with the remedies is
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
they occur and i guess i would say if we
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
put these remedies in this bill
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
then i would
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
sit here and say please go through every
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
criminal rsa and add the same remedies
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to any type of evidence
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's already happening but i don't know
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
why you would do it for this bill and
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
not aggravated felonious sexual assault
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
would would your concern um be um
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
not as great if the date if the way the
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
date was worded was maybe the current
 
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.269 align:start position:0%
date was worded was maybe the current
version

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
and if the remedies were removed from
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
yes sir if the date was removed and the
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
law said we are to adhere to the
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general's
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
current best practice
 
00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:24.549 align:start position:0%
current best practice
um

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
i personally believe somewhere in there
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
there should be a grace period and i
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
would even be fined if a date was
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
determined um because we have an agency
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
of 180 manchester state police large
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
agencies can't do it overnight but i'd
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
be fine with a a
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
a reasonable uh grace period and yes if
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
the remedies weren't there i
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
i read the current law i really have no
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
issue with it other than it doesn't
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
mention anything about a grace period
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
and there is a mention to the actual
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
manual which changes every decade
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer thank you
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative calling
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
um sir for taking a question
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh the current bill does have uh
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
something of a break period and that
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
would take effect 60 days after passage
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient time you think for a
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
race carrier or time needed
 
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.230 align:start position:0%
race carrier or time needed
uh

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
based on your answer to the previous
 
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.710 align:start position:0%
based on your answer to the previous
question

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
so based on the answer and please
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong i thought the 60
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
days from the passage was the date the
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
law took effect
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh when i say grace period what i'm
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
referring to is not
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
the law what i'm saying is
 
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.389 align:start position:0%
the law what i'm saying is
if

00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
if a new best practice comes out two
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
years from now and there was a grace
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
period for all because i believed some
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge is over 300
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state um knowing that
 
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.350 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state um knowing that
nashua

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
cannot adhere to a new best practice
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
within a 24 hour span if it said
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
when the attorney general comes out with
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
a new best practice law enforcement will
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
follow it they will have x amount of
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
time um to adhere to it i think that
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
would be fair and i'm saying that to
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
show it's not that we're against the
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
innocence project when i testified three
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
years ago i said everything they said is
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
accurate i'm just afraid of codifying a
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
procedure uh we're on board with the
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%

testimony
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
let me try and
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
capture some of the answers to questions
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
that have been raised and comments that
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
have been made
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
the innocence project has been trying to
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
implement this help implement this
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
reform and collaborate with the attorney
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
general's office for seven years
 
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.430 align:start position:0%
general's office for seven years
um

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
four years ago
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
i helped write a survey that was sent
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
out to every single law enforcement
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
agency in new hampshire in anticipation
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the original bill
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
and eight
 
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.990 align:start position:0%
and eight
eight

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies responded as to
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
what their practices were
 
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.150 align:start position:0%
what their practices were
um

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
um we then drafted a bill uh the bill
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
that uh and we included originally we
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
included remedies in it and then we
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated we had a meeting at the
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office which i
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
intended attended with the attorney
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
general's office with three members of
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
the police chiefs association
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
and they said not to worry everybody's
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to comply with this we do not need
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
remedies period
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why remedies were left out
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
four years later the attorney general's
 
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.069 align:start position:0%
four years later the attorney general's
office

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:13.270 align:start position:0%
office
surveys

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
collects the information from all the
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
police departments it seeks to collect
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
information from every single law
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire about whether they're
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
following this policy as the statute
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
requires only 45 percent of the law
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies responded to that
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
survey so we do know that
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
55 percent of law enforcement agencies
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
that are not responding to whether
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
they're following the policy or not
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
included in those who
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
did not respond to the uh
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the uh request of the attorney
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
general's office is
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
some that are following it like nashua
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
nashua did not respond
 
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
nashua did not respond
um

00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
so the measures the remedies that are
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
implemented here are are are mild
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
they don't require that if you don't
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
follow the policy it be suppressed or
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
the jury must ignore it it just says
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
they can consider it
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
cur under current law it's up to a judge
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
to decide whether the
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
eyewitness identification procedure has
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
been suggestive number one
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's been unnecessarily
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
suggestive number two and whether the um
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
the identification even if it was
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
suggestive and unnecessarily so is
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise reliable that's that's what a
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
judge needs to consider
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
this adds to that that the judge may
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
also consider whether they complied with
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's best practices
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's all this does and it allows the
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
jury to also consider it it's a mild
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
remedy for
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
failure to comply i know of no judge
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
who's ever suppressed an eyewitness
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
identification because they didn't
 
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
identification because they didn't
comply

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
comply
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
with the some policy they look at the
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
identification itself and see see
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's suggestive and
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily so so we need these
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
remedies to get police departments in
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to tell us what they're
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
doing and whether they're complying it's
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
really simple it's really
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's closer to
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
housekeeping than anything else
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh lastly
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
i hearken back to when this original
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill was before this committee those of
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
you who are on it i'm sure remember the
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony of jennifer thompson
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
jennifer thompson woke up one night in
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
north carolina being raped
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
she was scared for her life she did not
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
expect to live
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and she promised herself if i lived
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna remember everything i can
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
about what this guy looks like
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
so he can be found
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
and prosecuted
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
she lived
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
she described the person to the police
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
she picked
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
a man named ronald cotton out of a
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
lineup and she identified him at trial
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
he was convicted and sentenced to prison
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
several years later post-conviction dna
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
testing found that he could not have
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
been the person who sexually assaulted
 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.790 align:start position:0%
been the person who sexually assaulted
her

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with best practices
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
is so important those of you who were on
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
this committee back then i'm sure
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
remember her testimony which was
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and very powerful
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
and so uh i
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
real strongly encourage the police the
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
police to follow these practices but i
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
this uh committee uh to vote ought to
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
pass on this
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'm more than willing to entertain
 
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.589 align:start position:0%
i'm more than willing to entertain
questions

00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
mr you were the beneficiary of a
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
negligence of the chair to keep track of
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
the time but uh
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
i keep trying i i'm afflicted by being a
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
law professor if i had to guess that was
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative bolden you recognize
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i was a little
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
late today so i'm catching up but
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
ask if
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
um this uh the the witness is telling us
 
00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:43.109 align:start position:0%
um this uh the the witness is telling us
that

00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
the consequence of
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
current practices could be
 
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.990 align:start position:0%
current practices could be
that

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.829 align:start position:0%
that
a

00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:52.390 align:start position:0%
a
victim

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
victim
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
does not successfully identify
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
their assailant and the victim does not
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
get justice is that what you're telling
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
us that
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
and so conversely if we
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
successfully change
 
00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:07.829 align:start position:0%
successfully change
the

00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:07.839 --> 00:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that we would have more
 
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.109 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that we would have more
justice

00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
is is that what you're telling us
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes i think by adopting this it is it
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
makes it more likely
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
that those police departments who are
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
not following the practices the best
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
practices of the attorney general's
 
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.630 align:start position:0%
practices of the attorney general's
office

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
um will follow them and there will be
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
more justice both
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
where the right person will be
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and for those who may be
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
thank you see seeing new enhancers i
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for his
 
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.230 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for his
testimony

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes so i'm cynthia musso i'm from the
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
new england innocence project and uh
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
formerly of the public defender's office
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to uh sort of
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
reiterate a couple of points that buzz
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
made and you know he sort of made them
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
but i did want to sort of weigh in and
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate that the reality is and one of
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
the things i think that we get tripped
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
up on is that there seems to be this
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
sort of idea that this is kind of a
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
punishment to the police when reality
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is a protection afforded to
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
innocent folks that are facing you know
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions you know in our
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
system and it's also a an affording of
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
protection to the victims of these
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
crimes there's a crime in massachusetts
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
that we that we represented uh the uh
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
defendant in where he was identified by
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
five separate people
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
in three separate sexual assaults and
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
the practical reality is dna
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
post-conviction testing revealed that he
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
was not the perpetrator of those
 
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.550 align:start position:0%
was not the perpetrator of those
assaults

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
assaults
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this was so long after the
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
fact that there had these victims who uh
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
their their assailants were never found
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
these were brutal uh stranger assaults
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
in in massachusetts were really left
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
without justice as was our client who
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
was sent to prison lost his entire
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
military career uh and lost all of his
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
hopes and dreams on on the basis of
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
these witness identifications
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
in cases where uh the procedures that
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
are proposed to be put in place were not
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
put in place
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh it certainly would not have been a
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
punishment uh to anybody uh had the
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
procedures kept out these eyewitness
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
identifications because the correct
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
person could have been found earlier and
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
the wrong person would have been able to
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
go home and i think i don't want that
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
that point to be lost when we're
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
thinking about the importance of this
 
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.150 align:start position:0%
thinking about the importance of this
bill

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um and thank you for taking my
 
00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.750 align:start position:0%
thank you um and thank you for taking my
question

00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.870 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how the remedies uh that
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
are in the bill
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
would actually reduce the odds of the
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
situation that you described happening
 
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.150 align:start position:0%
situation that you described happening
so

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
a person is is falsely accused by five
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
different people uh later can you know
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the conviction is later uh
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
overturned by dna evidence
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
how do these remedies lower the risk
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
of that actually happening to an
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
innocent person yes that's a great
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
question i think that the important
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
thing to recognize is that uh
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
what we would rather be doing is
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
correcting these things before people
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
are sent to prison rather than after
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
right and so any protections that we can
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
put in place that are going to ensure
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
that unreliable evidence isn't put
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
before a jury is critical in making sure
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
that that pre-conviction process is
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
followed in this particular case for
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
example if the procedures had not been
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
followed and the judge as the gatekeeper
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
of that evidence had prevented that
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
evidence from going to the jury there
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
would have been no evidence against our
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
client to convict him in the first place
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
because there was no forensic evidence
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
that led to his conviction uh other than
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
these this eyewitness testimony so the
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
practical reality was there would have
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
been no evidence in that case and our
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
client would not have gone to prison in
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
the first place often our
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
post-conviction uh statistics and the
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
things that we learn in these
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
post-conviction cases highlight the
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
deficits of the criminal legal system
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
that happen pre-conviction and that
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the case with this type
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
of uh evidence
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
um my question is do you
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
is it your opinion that the that if we
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
leave the remedies in this bill that
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
will be more effective in what you are
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
trying to what the innocence project is
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely i can speak to this both as a
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
public defender and as as a
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative the new england innocence
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
project the practical reality is is that
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
these bills can go into place but
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
without any remedy
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bills become somewhat meaningless in
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
other words if the court doesn't have a
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
way to act on the bill the bill just
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
becomes something that is kind of
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
ethereal uh
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
i as a public defender was not even
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
aware that this bill had been placed
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
when it was originally put in place but
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
this remedy will definitely make it
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
accessible to criminal defense attorneys
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
in a way that they can use this in
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
defense of their clients when there is
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know faulty eyewitness
 
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
uh you know faulty eyewitness
identifications

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
identifications
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
follow mr chairman
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
recognize for a
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you um
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
is it also your opinion that um
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that some
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
police departments do not uh comply with
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
the law in a timely manner is a
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
different issue and that this bill
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
as as it is right now it does not
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
address that issue and that is not a
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that police i'm a little
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
confused about your question but i i'm
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
gonna say is the question that uh
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
that uh the timeliness is whether the
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
timeliness is material or not
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
i believe that you're saying that the
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
that these remedies have to be in there
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i believe my opinion is that the
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
professor um
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
shear said that there was a problem
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
because people didn't respond and people
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
are not complying but that's a
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
completely different issue that we may
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
address some other way
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
other than amending this bill to take
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
care of that
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's my question
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
the timeliness i think and the the
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliance the reason that those
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
things are important to be you know
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
together and to be here i think is that
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that again again i
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
mean i think the fact that the police
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
departments haven't complied with the
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
statute is completely related to the
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
reason why we need a remedy written into
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
the statute i mean those things are
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
interrelated i mean that that's the
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
proof is in the pudding right there
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
right at the end of the day if there
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be compliance and there
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be proof of compliance
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is why we have to have a remedy
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise the bill becomes uh
 
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.510 align:start position:0%
otherwise the bill becomes uh
meaningless

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative knight you're recognized
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um thank you for
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
when people are falsely accused as i
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
understand it the state gets sued and
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers put the bill for
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-compliance happening in our police
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
departments is that true
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
are you asking me if when people are
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
wrongfully convicted they can sue
 
00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.790 align:start position:0%
wrongfully convicted they can sue
yes

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh i mean i think the practical reality
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
of i mean is it possible i am not a
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
civil attorney i'm a criminal attorney
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
so those would never be that would not
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
be something i would ever give anybody
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
legal advice about uh the practical
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
reality is that uh
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
there are a number of uh immunities that
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
exist that insulate and protect police
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
departments and the state um from
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
answering and and having a lot of
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
accountability as far as um
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
non-compliance goes and so the practical
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
reality of suing whether you absolutely
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know whether there's a bar to it or
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
not uh is that those suits are very
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
rarely successful even to the extent
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they are initiated in the first
 
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.589 align:start position:0%
that they are initiated in the first
place

00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative knight recognized for our
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so what you're saying is that
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
it's even hard it's even harder to
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
identify in people to make their cases
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
when they're actually wrongfully
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
convicted as well
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
not adding insult to injury on top of
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire having
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
to pay out of pocket for the police
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
officers mistakes on not following a
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
compliance protocol
 
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.589 align:start position:0%
compliance protocol
right

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative martin thank you mr
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.270 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
let's say that we got a crime and let's
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
say we've got a couple of eyewitnesses
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
eyewitnesses um
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
going to be examined by the prosecutor
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
and going to be examined maybe even by
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
the defense attorney try it to the court
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
hearing except
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
the understanding of how the law works
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
so of course that that's the nature of
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
the trial process what we've learned
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
from statistics over time and what we've
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
learned from wrongful conviction cases
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
is that people's memories are actually
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
scientifically very unreliable and that
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
the crucible of cross-examination which
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
we rely on so often in criminal court to
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
suss out truth is not always very
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
effective at doing so the practical
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
reality is we all believe the things
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we think that we saw with our own
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
eyes and explaining to somebody that
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's actually not accurate is really
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
difficult and explaining that to jurors
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
is really difficult as well it's very
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
often that folks are not lying the issue
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
is not that we think people are lying
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
the issue is that people's memories are
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
mistaken the five people that identified
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
our client in massachusetts as the
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
guilty person were not lying they just
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
didn't remember correctly or they didn't
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
remember the details correctly there's a
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
number of different factors that can
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
kind of go into that and certainly yes
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
people can try to cross-examine but
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's really insufficient and it's why
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
we need the judge as a gatekeeper and
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
why this remedy is so critical in
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
hello

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative morrison you recognize
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you mr
 
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.549 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question thank you mr
chairman

00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
the the question just needed a yes or no
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
but let me go on to say
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor is going to examine an
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
eyewitness first
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
when we ask when a question is asked for
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
witness even if it is directed really to
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
be a yes no question we normally don't
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
want to instruct the witness how to
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
answer it
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
president meant it wasn't intended that
 
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.109 align:start position:0%
president meant it wasn't intended that
way

00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
i apologize you may start the question
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
my question resolves in that the
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
prosecuting gets to decide whether
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
somebody is is
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
credible or not credible
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
the defense attorney gets the chance to
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
do the same thing and present that kind
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
of an evidence situation
 
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.549 align:start position:0%
of an evidence situation
but

00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
let's be honest the eyewitness
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
no matter how many of them there are or
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
how little there is if there's only one
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
they too have a right to testify
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
and this is all about credibility with
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
that all being said it's so
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
big and subjective there's no piece of
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that's ever going to resolve
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
the truth in the matter
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
that's my question
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
the practical reality is there is not
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
one statute that's going to solve all
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
the problems of the criminal legal
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
system but it doesn't mean that we
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't make efforts in small ways
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
that would make uh dense into uh
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
inaccurate information being presented
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
to a jury and the reality is although we
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh know that uh
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
i mean at the end of the day prosecutors
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
and defense attorneys actually don't
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
make determinations about credibility
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's left up to the fact finder and
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
the jury and what we're trying to do is
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
to give the jury the most accurate and
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
truthful information because we don't
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
want the jury to make import make
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
decisions and make choices about
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
people's guilt or innocence and about uh
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
the their their lives based on uh
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
information that's uh
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrably false or has been
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
coerced through
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
united states of america and to the
 
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
under god indivisible with liberty and

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
um would it be appropriate to find a
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
suitable and respectful location for the
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
flag i have a hard time seeing it's
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to be moved okay the flag has only
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
moved to the middle for the pledge of
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
allegiance uh however good negligence of
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
the chair we i forgot to recognize
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative morrison
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
hence the flag was in the middle of
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
blocking the view
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
but you always can see on the computer
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
at this time we will open the public

offered by the former committee chairman

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
um so the language contained in this
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
bill does a few important things first
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
it clarifies the existing statute on how
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
someone would petition for this type of
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
redress uh specifically the court uh
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
which they would sort of make their
 
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.309 align:start position:0%
which they would sort of make their
request

00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
it includes a provision to assign an
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
attorney to someone who pursues this
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
type of testing
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh but only if they meet uh who is
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
indigent and only if they meet existing
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
rigorous requirements to qualify for
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
this type of release
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
it clarifies the process for testing the
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
biological material what lab would be
 
00:57:47.599 --> 00:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
biological material what lab would be
used

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
how the results would be shared
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
with the state and with the person
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
seeking the testing
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
um another important uh point to note is
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bill lets people who have completed
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
their sentences uh but who uh believe
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
they were wrongfully convicted uh can
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
request this testing in an effort to
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
clear their name this person
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
i like all others who might apply for
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
the relief would still need to meet the
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
existing standards
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh for their request to move forward
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
so a little bit about why this necessary
 
00:58:19.599 --> 00:58:21.430 align:start position:0%
so a little bit about why this necessary
um

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know we've
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
become accustomed to this idea of dna
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
and biological evidence being sort of
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere and we see that in csi and
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
other tv shows but
 
00:58:31.839 --> 00:58:32.630 align:start position:0%
other tv shows but
um

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
the reality is
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
not many cases have dna evidence
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about a small number
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
of cases
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
where this type of redress would likely
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
be requested
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
and the number of cases where
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
the individual would qualify and where
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
the biological evidence would be enough
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
to exonerate someone is really a tiny
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
we also have seen i suspect many of us
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
news accounts of people exonerated for
 
00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:04.870 align:start position:0%
news accounts of people exonerated for
um

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
serious times like murder and rape
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
through dna after serving long sentences
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh one caveat is that here in new
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire nobody has been exonerated
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
through these means and while i'd like
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
to believe that that means nobody in our
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
prison system
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
um pastor president was innocent the
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
data nationwide just suggests otherwise
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would give someone who
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
finds themselves in this terrible
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
situation a method of seeking their
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
freedom or their clearing their name
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
safeguards in the statute would already
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
protect the state against frivolous
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
claims or attempts
 
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:38.710 align:start position:0%
claims or attempts
to

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
pursue this redress and finally while
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
the bill does contain a fiscal note
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
the judicial council has reviewed this
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
and based on the you know very few
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
number of um
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
dna testing requests in a year the
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does indicate quote uh an
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
insignificant increase in expenditures
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
um i asked the committee to recommend
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
passage passage of the bill i will take
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
questions i'm also happy to seed the
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
floor to experts who are expected to
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
testify after me
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:30.549 align:start position:0%

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative my
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
um belief is that this bill um was not
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
significantly changed i don't know if a
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
word or two changed but the concept the
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr conway
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
i heard you say that to the best of your
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
knowledge you don't think that this has
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
taken place in the state of new
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire where somebody has been
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
exonerated because of the dna
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
testing is that correct uh
 
01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:08.549 align:start position:0%
testing is that correct uh
representative

01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
um in my job as a reporter you learn not
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
to say something is the first or the
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
only because there's always one that
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
someone will come back i that is the
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge that this that a
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
dna uh
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
has not cleared someone i suspect if i
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
was incorrect somebody will correct me
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
in testimony and i will certainly
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
correct the committee representative
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
martin you have a follow-up question
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so my follow-up
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
team representative carly is this this
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
is not to to address a wrong in trying
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
to write it it's being proactive ahead
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
of time in case it should happen thank
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
you representative we have um this
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
process on the books already this
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
essentially um modify it's really a
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill in terms of aligning
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
our existing statute with best practices
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
from other states it's not um you know a
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
radical reforming it's
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's really just cleaning up the
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
statute in a lot of ways
 
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.829 align:start position:0%
statute in a lot of ways
representative

01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
testament thank you mr chairman thank
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
you representative connolly
 
01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.349 align:start position:0%
you representative connolly
is

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
a capability now that will
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
end up with
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
less in this case the prisoner's dna is
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
in some larger database
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
can other agencies access this
 
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
can other agencies access this
and

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
maybe make the connection of a previous
 
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.270 align:start position:0%
maybe make the connection of a previous
crime

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
this person is he opening himself up to
 
01:02:34.559 --> 01:02:37.510 align:start position:0%
this person is he opening himself up to
prosecution

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
guy across he they ended up with his dna
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
and they found out
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative i don't have a good
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
answer to that question i believe in the
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
california case it was a family member
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
um that they tracked him down through i
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
could be wrong on that but i i don't
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
know enough about
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
what's in place with dna in our state
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
but i suspect other people might be able
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
to members of the public we will do a
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
better job of enforcing this go around
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
yes i will be quick thank you so much uh
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
again and on this bill i really
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate it my name is beth powers i
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
am the state campaigns director for the
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
innocence project a national
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
organization dedicated to exonerating
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
wrongfully convicted people through
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
post-conviction dna testing and
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
reforming the criminal justice system to
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
prevent future injustice this committee
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
heard and unanimously passed this bill
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
last year and we thank you for your
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
support and again ask for your support
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
this year nationally there have been 370
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
75 dna exonerations however none have
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
occurred in the state of new hampshire
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
which is what representative conley just
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
stated that does not mean there are not
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
wrongfully convicted people in the state
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
it means that we have not had any
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
exonerations proven through dna
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
hb270 would clarify and modernize the
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
current process for seeking dna testing
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
post conviction this change would not
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
make it easier or lessen the standard by
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
which a conviction is overturned but
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
would rather simply create a clearer
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
path for obtaining dna testing these
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
changes not only benefit the wrongfully
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
convicted often in the course of
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
settling an innocence claim the actual
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
perpetrator of the crime is also
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
identified and therefore prevented from
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
committing additional crimes changes to
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the existing post-conviction dna testing
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
law would enable justice for the few who
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
have experienced the unique horror of
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
wrongful conviction who could benefit
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
from proving their innocence through dna
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
testing for those few bill for those few
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
this bill is monumental i've provided
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
written comments that detail the changes
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill along with
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
national context
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
i won't go into that now in the interest
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
of time but i'm happy to answer any
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
questions i thank you and urge you to
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you miss powers for your testimony
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
the chair would ask to inquire of a
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
question and i want to thank you in
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question
 
01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:45.750 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question
uh

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
this is more of a nationwide question
 
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.270 align:start position:0%
this is more of a nationwide question
but

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
your organization has handled a lot of
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
post-conviction cases involving dna
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh how often or how difficult is it for
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
that dna to be provided for you know
 
01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:03.829 align:start position:0%
that dna to be provided for you know
testing

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
would say that is going to completely
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
depend on the case and on the state
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors to consider how
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
old is the case what is the evidence
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
preservation in the state are they
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
required to preserve the evidence you
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
know if someone
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
often times our clients who are
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
exonerated have served 10 20 30 40 years
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
in prison so we're talking about very
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
old crimes so i would say that it's
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
going to depend on so many factors one
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the reasons this bill is so important
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
is because
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
being able to actually get the testing
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
is so critical that's why this is so
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
important new hampshire's law right now
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
is significantly out of line in terms of
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
how hard it is just to request the
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
testing imagine being in prison for
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
something you didn't do
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
thinking there's dna in your test in
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
your case and wanting it tested and not
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
being able to get that tested that's
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
what this is about but to answer your
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
question there's just a lot of factors
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh that will will change that that
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
answer state to state
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and when it comes to testing a
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
dna or any biological substance do you
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
do you know the approximate cost of that
 
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.270 align:start position:0%
do you know the approximate cost of that
test

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know i think that's also going to to
 
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.150 align:start position:0%
you know i think that's also going to to
be

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
dependent on where you are in in in the
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
in the state it really can vary i know
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
that it can be a costly process but in
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
regard to this bill
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
the number of folks this would apply to
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
is really small and so i think that um
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
spoke on this on the fiscal impact and i
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
think you'll hear from buzz later who
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
anecdotally can speak to the number of
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
these types of claims he has seen and my
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's in the range of
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
10. it's a really small amount so i
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that you know the systems
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
that are already in place to do the
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
testing are there they exist this is not
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
building anything new um or anything
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
representative testerman
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
ms powers uh i have a question
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.799 --> 01:08:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
clients

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
clients
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
were to submit his dna for
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
testing and it would ended up collected
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
could that
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
could the law enforcement people
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
prosecute him for some other crime
 
01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.229 align:start position:0%
prosecute him for some other crime
possibly

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's a good question i think
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
that's something that someone would have
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
to weigh out in making this decision i
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
think that someone who's incarcerated
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and sitting in prison for something they
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
didn't do
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
is probably willing to take that risk so
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes i think potentially if you tested
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
someone's dna and it came back i'm not
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
aware of it ever happening i'll say that
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
to you that doesn't mean it hasn't but
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of it happening but i
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
think more often than not you have a
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
circumstance where someone knows they
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
didn't do this and they're sitting in
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
prison and so they want this tested but
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
what has happened similar to your
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
question is we've had instances where
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
someone is innocent we're able to
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
finally test the dna and it matches
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
someone else in the system it's often
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
matched someone who's currently
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for something else that
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
could have potentially been prevented if
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
that person had been correctly
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
identified in the first place so that it
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
does happen that hits come back and
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no for uh no hands
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
raised i want to thank the witness for a
 
01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:28.470 align:start position:0%
raised i want to thank the witness for a
testimony

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative knight you have
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
i did but i was too late i'll respect
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh good morning again to the committee
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh my name is albert scherr i'm a
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
professor of law at unh
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
the opinions i express for my own
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
and not those of unh law or uh unh
 
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
and not those of unh law or uh unh
proper

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
proper
 
01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.070 align:start position:0%
proper
um

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
this is uh this area is is central to my
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
area of expertise uh i've been
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
litigating and lecturing and training
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
and writing about forensic dna evidence
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
since since the early 90s i handled the
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
first dna case in new hampshire
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
i've worked on a
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
13 year long innocence project case
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
so uh uh uh uh i'm gonna make every
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
effort possible did not take two minutes
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh the number of cases that this will ha
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
that there even is available biological
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
evidence is
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
really small you don't see dna evidence
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
with some rare except you don't see it
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
in drug cases you don't see it in any
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
financial crimes you don't see it in
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
most burglaries you don't see it in most
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
assault cases that are not sexual
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
assault the usually you see uh
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
biological samples of unknown origin in
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
sexual assault cases and murder cases
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
those are important cases but it's a
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
small small subsection
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
of all the cases out there number one
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly in the last five to ten
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
years where dna testing has been used
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
far more aggressively by prosecutors
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
offices in this state and around the
 
01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
offices in this state and around the
country

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
go so going forward you are going to see
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
less retesting
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
of dna samples uh because it's already
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
been done there may be a few here and
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
there where there's an allegation that
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
mistakes have been made so going forward
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
that many
 
01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
that many
finally

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
i've done an informal survey of over 200
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers in new
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire through a listserv in which i
 
01:11:48.719 --> 01:11:51.669 align:start position:0%
hampshire through a listserv in which i
participate

01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
none of them have litigated a uh have
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
have even applied for have have have
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
litigated uh the availability of
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
post-conviction dna testing under the
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
statute uh some of them know of inmates
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
who have tried to make their way through
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
the statute and failed because process
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
wise it's a good bit
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
more difficult than we want
 
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
but practically speaking this is a
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measure that makes it
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
simpler and clearer for what few
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
prisoners are out there who may wish to
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
avail themselves of it do so
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
finally in answer to representative
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
testerman's question everybody's who's
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
convicted of a felony in new hampshire
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
is obligated to give the state of new
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire a dna sample so the huge
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
majority of circumstances their dna is
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
already in a state genetic database in
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
the national genetic database the irony
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
of it is their dna is in there
 
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.709 align:start position:0%
of it is their dna is in there
but

01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
under the current statute it's really
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
hard for them to get testing on the
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
biological sample so i think that's
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
really the the best answer for our
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative testerman's question
 
01:12:58.159 --> 01:12:59.189 align:start position:0%
representative testerman's question
hopefully

01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair i came under two minutes
 
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.510 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair i came under two minutes
uh

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
if i may ask you
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
let me ask if the chair may ask a
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
question and i want to thank you in
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's my understanding this would
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
change the standard from clear and
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
to uh is the departments of the evidence
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
yeah so do you mind explaining maybe the
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
difference in those two standards
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh preponderance of the evidence is
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's more likely than not
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh that the proposition that is being
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
put forward is the case
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
50.001 percent
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
is more likely than not
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence is
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere between
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence and beyond
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
a reasonable doubt which is somewhere
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
over 99 percent clear and convincing
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
evidence you know oddly enough the best
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
way to characterize it is to play with
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
the words you need to be clearly
 
01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.390 align:start position:0%
the words you need to be clearly
convinced

01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
convinced
 
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.350 align:start position:0%
convinced
um

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's hard for somebody to convince
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
another person of
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
that they are that to be clearly
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
convinced uh of a proposition
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
particularly in these circumstances
 
01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
particularly in these circumstances
where

01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh judges uh
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have very much availability
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
to evidence uh and what you're trying to
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
establish is
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
well the proposition is uh it's the case
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
that this would likely provide
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence even though i was
 
01:14:39.679 --> 01:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence even though i was
convicted

01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so to have a clearly convinced
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
standard a clear and convincing standard
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
is a pretty rigorous standard i think
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
those people who try and quantify these
 
01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
those people who try and quantify these
standards

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
think it's somewhere over 75 percent
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh but you know i'm not a big fan of
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
quantifying numbers but you know it's
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere over 75 percent which
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
little reason
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
puts a substantial barrier in the way i
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
mean i think we all now recognize that
 
01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.270 align:start position:0%
mean i think we all now recognize that
with

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh with these statutes in other states
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
the floodgates are not opening to
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
frivolous loss
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
frivolous efforts to get dna testing
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
given all the other protections
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason to put so
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
substantial a barrier as clear and
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence in the way
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question if i just
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
may ask a follow-up question i want to
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you in advance for taking my
 
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.630 align:start position:0%
thank you in advance for taking my
question

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.149 align:start position:0%
question
but

01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
to your understanding and this is an
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
approximation how much does it cost to
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
actually do
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
the dna test
 
01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.750 align:start position:0%
the dna test
in

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
in a state like new hampshire that has a
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
forensic dna laboratory it's a trivial
 
01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.709 align:start position:0%
forensic dna laboratory it's a trivial
uh

01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
marginal cost to do one more uh dna
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
round of dna testing
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
um you know i couldn't even put a figure
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
in it but it it you know their lab is
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
set up to do this testing it's just them
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
doing one more test and they do hundreds
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
of tests a year
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh if it had to be sent out
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
i've seen it cost anywhere from 500 to a
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh in the first instance that would be
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
paid by the individual if they were
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
declared not indigent
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative hopper thank you mr chair
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh professor for taking my
 
01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.550 align:start position:0%
thank you uh professor for taking my
question

01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
um a couple of times in the legislation
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
it refers to rsa
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
526 colon
 
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.110 align:start position:0%
526 colon
4

01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
4
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
which seems to put a three-year limit on
 
01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.030 align:start position:0%
which seems to put a three-year limit on
the

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
ability for somebody to
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
petition the court to check their dna
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
is that a problem or
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
yes it is a problem and that's one of
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
the things we've attempted to fix with
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know there's no logical reason that
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
there should be a three-year limit
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
on filing a claim for post-conviction
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
dna testing you know the uh there are
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
statutes out there that govern
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
how long the state needs to preserve
 
01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.590 align:start position:0%
how long the state needs to preserve
evidence

01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
after the conviction is final and
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's no pending motions or court
 
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
there's no pending motions or court
actions

01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
actions
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what should govern how long a
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
person has to file there's no logic
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
behind a three-year limit and the goal
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is to take
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
take this statute out of that three-year
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
limit and let it depend on the
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
availability of
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the biological evidence as governed
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative true thank you mr chair
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you witness again for taking
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know of any uh instances in the
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire where
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
somebody in custody or somebody who's no
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
longer in custody
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
has asked for that dna testing to be
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
done and the courts have denied
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
them to have the right
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
to have it tested
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
i know of cases where uh
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
pre-trial lawyers have asked for dna
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
testing and for one reason or another
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
the government opposed it and the court
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
did not order it
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's not very common at all
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
but i know of those kind of cases you
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
know there are cases where uh the
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
government after they arrested an
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
individual there's a famous murder case
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
out of hopkinton in which they arrested
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
an individual for killing a young girl
 
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.110 align:start position:0%
an individual for killing a young girl
and

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
they were considering charging that
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
individual with capital murder they sent
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
the testing out for dna testing down to
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
the fbi i believe because they didn't
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
have a dna lab at that point in new
 
01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:08.950 align:start position:0%
have a dna lab at that point in new
hampshire

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the testing came back exculpin
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
exculpating the individual
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that's a good example of
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
the more prosecutors
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
and judges allow
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
pre-trial dna testing
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
the less people will need to take
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
i believe we're on to our last witness
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
but if there are any other members of
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
the public who wish to testify that are
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
in attendance
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
cheer recognizing cynthia
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
hi my name is cynthia musso good morning
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
again i am uh the representative from
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
the new england innocence project and i
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
am a former public defender in new
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a number of years um i had
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
some comments prepared but i wanted to
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
um highlight just a couple of things and
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
i i did submit written testimony as well
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to go over that again
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
but uh what i want to highlight what i
 
01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
really really want to reiterate here is
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
that this these amendments make very
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
small changes that would be very
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
impactful for the innocent folks in new
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are unable to access dna
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
post-conviction testing at this point um
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
i think the reality is is one of the
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
things we've been discussing today is
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
numbers um and my understanding is that
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh the reality is there have been
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i wanna uh commend representative
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
conley that's right there are no dna
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
exonerations in new hampshire at this
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
point the reality is is that even though
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
we know that it's not reflective of the
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
fact that new hampshire is in fact a
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
perfect system but rather uh that uh the
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
malfunctions that actually plague the
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system are just as
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
present here and the reality is we're
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
not catching these we're not catching
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
them and this uh these amendments to
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
this statute are gonna make it more
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
likely that we're going to catch these
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
cases um and be able to help some folks
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
that have been wrongfully convicted of
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
crimes um but it's still very very
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
limited um and and there's some sort of
 
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
natural limits that are already in place
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
which have been discussed today like as
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
buzz highlighted the cases that haven't
 
01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
buzz highlighted the cases that haven't
been

01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh that don't involve dna evidence the
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
preservation statute which is rsa 651 d3
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um there's also uh the fact that um
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
people don't necessarily people aren't
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to access the statute unless dna
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be exonerating uh so the
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
reality is if folks that it just because
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
you have dna in your case doesn't mean
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
the statute is going to be uh something
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
that you're going to access
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
the changes are small but the impact for
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
folks that have been wrongfully
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
convicted is great uh and the reality is
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
that justice for the victims is also at
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
play and i would reiterate that there
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
are a number of cases we just had a case
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
in 2019 in massachusetts where we had a
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
dna exoneration the dna was entered into
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
the system and the actual perpetrator of
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
the crime was found that way um as uh
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
beth discussed in her testimony so uh
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
the um consequences are really
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman i was about to
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
pass on eq 270.
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'll shake it
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
has been segmented by president morrison
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
and just for the members at home this is
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
not a rule but maybe as a better
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
practice during the executive session
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
they want to just keep keep our videos
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
on just to make sure uh
 
01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.590 align:start position:0%
on just to make sure uh
uh

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
it would make it would make my job
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
easier here
 
01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:31.060 align:start position:0%

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your emotion about
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
the past mr chairman there's little i
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
could ask that would be better than the
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
would anyone else i'll open the question
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative rose
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't really a question i guess
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's just more of a statement i
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
i really don't see anything negative
 
01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
i really don't see anything negative
that

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
with the dna but i think
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
like you can only you're only on child
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
for that particular client right so that
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
i don't really think about it
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
i think you could probably answer that
 
01:25:33.679 --> 01:25:34.950 align:start position:0%
i think you could probably answer that
better

01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.270 align:start position:0%
better
but

01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's just like any other evidence i'll
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
say and you know i'm not speaking by any
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
specific case that i haven't worked on
 
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.390 align:start position:0%
specific case that i haven't worked on
but

01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to request something that
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
if i know that it's going to incriminate
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know the defendant or my client
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
there is not somewhat of a discretion to
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
not request at least advise the person
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
are you sure you want you know
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
one that comes up often unrelated to dna
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
but a drunk driving boost
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
if the person really is impaired do you
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
really want to request the cooking
 
01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:17.830 align:start position:0%
really want to request the cooking
camera

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's within the discretion the attorney
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's just one example but just think
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the country these cases some
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
attorney generals are
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
have taken these all the way up to the
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
supreme court of their state
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
and they spend hundreds of thousands of
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
dollars trying to not produce
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
evidence that's in their possessions
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
if it's not exculpatory and it's only
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
going to prove without what some what
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
they already know i don't you know it's
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
i understand there's no harm in
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
producing it but there has been
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
exonerations throughout the country so
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
people served jail we've been in jail
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
for 10 15 years and there was one
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
mountain board involving a hair sample
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
this person was in jail for 18 years and
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
this was actually a case work on body
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
innocence project
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a little complicated but the
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
hair sample like i suppose when someone
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
passed away
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
you can tell by their hair after a
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
couple hours that they've been taken
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
away from a certain time period well the
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
hair sample that they
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
had inside that
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
linked addiction i'm sorry that's
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
defending the case
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
it had it was taken post-mortem
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
so when the person's charged murder that
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
hair sample wouldn't have been there
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
so they they were actually able to prove
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
evidence they were planning although
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
that person did get a very uh
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
very high civil judgment thereafter
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
was 18 million dollars they did spend 18
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
years their life in prison for a promise
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
they would prove they did not commit and
 
01:27:54.149 --> 01:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
the reason why it took so long
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
was that it took
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
like decades to get the dna testing that
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
everyone already had
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
and this is not for they they must have
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
spent more money defending that case in
 
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.629 align:start position:0%
spent more money defending that case in
florida

01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
florida
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then civil judgment there did this
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
it never should have gone that long they
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
had to have the whole time i i would be
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%

01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah this is just because i'm new to the
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
committee i'm kind of curious
 
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
committee i'm kind of curious
um

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
the reference to
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
420 whatever
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
what line
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
so i have no idea what mine is
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
says there's a three-year limit
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
obviously it doesn't apply to this
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
but why is there only a three-year limit
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
why would people be able to steal their
 
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.189 align:start position:0%
why would people be able to steal their
convictions

01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
much later than three years that's just
 
01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:01.730 align:start position:0%

01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating the rsa which is good
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
and you want to you want to eliminate
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
three years here which just does and the
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that some of the dna
 
01:29:20.239 --> 01:29:21.750 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that some of the dna
technology

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
existed at the time of the condition may
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
not exist in the present time
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
so they there are circumstances where
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
the testing of the asymptote didn't
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
exist within that three year window well
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
that particularly is more relevant to
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
cases from the early 90s mid 90s but
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
it's still a good idea to keep that
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not like that's really not
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
my question my question i understand
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
says not withstanding so therefore it
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
ignores 526 golden four
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
but what i don't understand is why
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
why your
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
526 colon 4 has a three-year limit why
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
i understand the question that maybe
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
that may be an issue for this community
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
to discuss in a different day
 
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.270 align:start position:0%
to discuss in a different day
because

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
it just seems very short
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
period of time because people can find
 
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
period of time because people can find
somehow

01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know i think i think that's
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
something that we all should look into
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i mean
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i think we'll discuss it
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
just one thing that i wanted to say i'll
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting this bill this year
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
just like i did last year um but one of
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
the things to note is that um this is a
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
very good bill that addresses a very
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
very very um
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
small number of people um and and
 
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.470 align:start position:0%
small number of people um and and
hopefully

01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
one of the outcomes of a bill like this
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
is that somebody who may have been
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
wrongfully convicted will will be
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
released uh but it is interesting to
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
note uh the way that this bill was
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
paired with uh
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
with the previous bill and the fact that
 
01:31:05.199 --> 01:31:06.070 align:start position:0%
with the previous bill and the fact that
um

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
many more people are subject to
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
eyewitness identification and sometimes
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
improper identification
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
so the potential impact of the bill we
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
heard earlier is
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
significantly greater for a wider range
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
of people
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to kind of note how the
 
01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.070 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to kind of note how the
bills

01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
seem to work together
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and i know we're not talking
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
about the other bill but i guess i'll
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
i support this bill
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing known hand
 
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing known hand
representative

01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
not not really a feel-good bill but
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're addressing an issue that's never
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
happened in new hampshire
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're addressing an issue that
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
no one has ever been denied the
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go back even after when
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
you're releasing
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
from jail to go back and have dna tested
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever been denied that
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
now nowadays dna is very common
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
i would think most
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
would be looking at
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
dna testing if they're
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
for the innocent clients
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a great idea it's a great bill
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
that means
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
oh i respect the comments of the
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative i will just explain that
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
what this is doing
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
in this in our justice system and i i
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
respect our system i believe in our
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
system and i
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
i work in the system
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i stand by it
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
but i will say
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
there are limited occasions where
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
a person is wrongfully convicted
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
one wrongfully convicted person is too
 
01:33:04.239 --> 01:33:05.030 align:start position:0%
one wrongfully convicted person is too
many

01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
and i i would think that this
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
if it did happen this puts that person
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
in the best position to right
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
or correct that injustice
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it hasn't happened yet
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's because it hasn't
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't proven it that it's happened
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
yet doesn't mean it hasn't happened yet
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not implying that it's happening in
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:25.030 align:start position:0%
the future
but

01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
i would say being proactive on this
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
would be the best approach because
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
if someone spends a decade in
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated keep in mind
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
if you have an innocent person in prison
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
and most likely we're talking about rape
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
or murder
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
and you have the wrong person
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
in jail that means there is a chance
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
that there is a murderer or rapist
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
out in the public who is actually
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting away with
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
that crime so there's really two
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
injustices there because the bit is the
 
01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.229 align:start position:0%
injustices there because the bit is the
victim

01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
victim
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the victims families
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know they deserve justice too they
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
have the actual
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
correct person prosecuted
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
in charge of the program so i think it
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
really the only help
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
if you could answer one question before
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
i spend uh
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
68 seconds on my speech you could stop
 
01:34:21.679 --> 01:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
68 seconds on my speech you could stop
that

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.149 align:start position:0%
that
oh

01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's up to the ag i mean the ag would
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
could fight if somebody wanted to do
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
this test is that correct
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes they have the art if they have the
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
option to object to it or they can
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
consent to it
 
01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:37.669 align:start position:0%
consent to it
okay

01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
all right may i continue then all right
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
now that i understand that which i
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
thought that's what was the case um
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
i can't remember who the presidential
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
candidate that lived in goffstown
 
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
candidate that lived in goffstown
um

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
she was on the democrat side
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh kelsey
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah she mentioned an ag in california
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
on the debate stage where
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
she did exactly what we're trying to
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
prevent here
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
so what my point is is we really can't
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
control the future
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
if we don't do anything we can't control
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
the future a.g
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
person in new hampshire if they went
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
rogue on us and started doing this like
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
the california ag did years ago
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking why not support this uh
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
because of that situation you know right
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
now it probably hasn't happened
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
but we can't control the future aeg
 
01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.709 align:start position:0%
but we can't control the future aeg

01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%

01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised uh deploring up

01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%

all right and just to the members i
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
understand before we take a million
 
01:38:18.639 --> 01:38:19.750 align:start position:0%
understand before we take a million
questions

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
unless you know the specific answer to
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
please don't raise your hand but my
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that in order for
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
somebody to go on the consent calendar
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
they do not have a fiscal note we are
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
growth so this happens this one out of
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
zero dollars but it's a fiscal note
 
01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.149 align:start position:0%
zero dollars but it's a fiscal note
nonetheless

01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
of course right
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
it says on
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the official note there would
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
it would have to be taken off and said
 
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.149 align:start position:0%
it would have to be taken off and said
yeah

01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
i just want to mention that there was
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that um the
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
defendants would have to pay for
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
the testing
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
and the and the other piece of that is
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
that the um state if they're the ones
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's trying to prove it of course
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
i will uh
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
be sure to uh consult with the park
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
right now representative newman
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
is this regarding that specific issue
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
and do you have an answer for it
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
no i i have a question of the chair
 
01:39:32.159 --> 01:39:34.709 align:start position:0%
no i i have a question of the chair
adjusting

01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
we might be able to do another executive
 
01:39:36.239 --> 01:39:38.950 align:start position:0%
we might be able to do another executive
session

01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
i understand that i'm just concerned
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
about uh or i have a question about
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
there was a real issue erased in in this
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
bill about the time limit and that it
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
was very short and in this time in this
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
time of time restraints
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
i was going to vote for this bill and
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we could fix that later is that a
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
right approach to that or
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
is that doesn't matter
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a question that it would
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
if i can control how you voted every
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
single time representative newman it
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
would make my life a lot easier
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
if i i didn't understand you i didn't
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
hear your comment
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:02.690 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank the
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
fellow members of this committee for
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
i've got
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
a little story to tell you because this
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
bill as it's presented also has an
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that in a moment
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
the reason the amendment came about was
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
because when i put this request into ols
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
and we sent it out to me as they as you
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
all know you ask for a bill
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
they research or what have you and then
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
they send it to you for your approval
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
well i waited and waited and waited and
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
i never got anything back from ols
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
so i ended up inquiring what happened to
 
01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.310 align:start position:0%
so i ended up inquiring what happened to
my

01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
request for a bill
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
well we sent it to you
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
14 days ago
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh what what address did you send it to
 
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
my old
 
01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.430 align:start position:0%
my old
four-year-old

01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
four-year-old
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
email address which was a legislative
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
email when i was up here before
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i had long since deleted it
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
and now i've got that all straightened
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
out with the state
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
so that people will just send it to my
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
regular email
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
so when i finally got it i only had
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
three days to approve it
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
and get it back in or it would have died
 
01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
and get it back in or it would have died
off

01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
so i just said i just went ahead and
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
said yes it's good let's go
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
then when i read it some more
 
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
i realized there were some stakes in the
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
bill and that's why the amendment is
 
01:44:45.199 --> 01:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
bill and that's why the amendment is
there

01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
but now let's talk a little bit about
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
the bill and what it's about
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
because i'm a firm believer
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
that we have bills presented to us
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
to try to rectify problems
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's no problem to be
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
solved why have a bill
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
well in this case
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very serious problem
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it and i've been involved with
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
little leagues and so i know about
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
child's sexual abuse
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
not that i've done it but i know that
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
there are people that do it
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
my point is that this case came about
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
because of a constituent of mine
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
who came to me and said
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:38.229 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
person that did
 
01:45:39.679 --> 01:45:40.629 align:start position:0%
person that did
was

01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
was arrested was convicted
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
and is in jail i believe he got
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
sentences

01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
running i guess one after the other so
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
he's in there for a little while
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
this started back in way back in
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
13 if i'm not mistaken uh
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
and i've got a lot of notes here from
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
the parents that they gave to me
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
and what they're looking for is not
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
any more to do with the case
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
and the predator
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
gets done and over with and they're
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
happy with the results
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
but they had one question from the
 
01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.709 align:start position:0%
but they had one question from the
get-go

01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
get-go
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
they asked the police when they went in
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
and into his apartment and he was an
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
acquaintance of the family
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
and arrested him
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
there was a and they knew the story the
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
police did that this happened on this
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
guy's couch
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
with a computer
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
looking right at the couch
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
and all the technology now this was not
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
an ordinary
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
computer this was something that was
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
handmade or to that extent that somebody
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
created it and put all kinds of devices
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
into it and on it
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
so you could end up
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
well being able to take either photos or
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
videos and this was in the room where
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
the molestation occurred
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
the police
 
01:47:14.639 --> 01:47:15.830 align:start position:0%
the police
didn't

01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
impound or confiscate the computer they
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
didn't ask for a warrant
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
the prosecuting attorney
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything about this guy's
 
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.149 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything about this guy's
computer

01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
computer
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
now mind you the parents are jumping up
 
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
and down
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
at this time saying
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
we want to know if our son
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
has been videotaped or had pictures
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
taken of him in the process of this
 
01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.189 align:start position:0%
taken of him in the process of this
crime

01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
and everybody ignored him
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
they got the court they asked the judge
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
and he said oh no you don't have a right
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
so i take that
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
a predator
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
a child molester has more rights
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
than the parents or the kids to know if
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to be posted on the
 
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
they're going to be posted on the
internet

01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to any of us
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
a predator has more rights
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
than the parents to know if their kid is
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
on the internet
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
and nobody is everybody is saying no we
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't we don't want to look at that
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're not interested
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
well the parents are
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
not for their case
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
they just know what happened to them
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
they don't want it to happen to some
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
other parents some other children and we
 
01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:34.790 align:start position:0%
other parents some other children and we
know

01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i know
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
having been a president of a little
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
league and looked into
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
i one time
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
went on site to find out how many
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
predators were in
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
the district that my little league was
 
01:48:49.119 --> 01:48:50.070 align:start position:0%
the district that my little league was
in

01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it was somewhere in the vicinity of
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
150 to 200 predators around little
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
league fields etc etc
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
so they're out there
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
and they love taking pictures and they
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
love putting it on the internet
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
and we gotta find a way
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
to stop that
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
the section about computers and
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
pornography and child exploitation
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're there if they had gone in and
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
looked at this guy's computer and found
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
pictures images or video
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
that would then became also a federal
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
crime as i understand it now i'm not a
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
lawyer and i could be wrong
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
but i understand it could be a federal
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
crime which would enhance the penalties
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
 
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.470 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
so

01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
so the bill as it is is asking that
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
we seize the personal computers and
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
electronic devices
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement officer who has
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe that the
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
personal computer
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
or other electronic devices is being
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
used to violate any provision of this
 
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:00.470 align:start position:0%
used to violate any provision of this
chapter

01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
may now here's where i make messed up
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
without obtaining a search warrant see
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
such personal computer or other
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
electronic devices
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
so my amendment
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
changes that
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
that it has to have it's not without a
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
warrant there has to be a warrant and
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
then they can seize it
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
and they're only seizing it for the
 
01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.709 align:start position:0%
and they're only seizing it for the
purpose

01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
of looking into the computer somebody
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have a gripe in this it's
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
not the parents looking at it it may not
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
even be the
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement people what they want to
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
do is look in this guy's computer
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
and find out if he's got images
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
and he's playing around as well
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
after he's done the molestation now this
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
molestation happened to this young man
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
about five years and
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
maybe a parent is going to testify after
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
i get done
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
to just give you some of the flavor from
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
their point of view
 
01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.430 align:start position:0%
their point of view
so

01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
i found that i
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
that this is something that
 
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
i i like to ask a question when people
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
bring a bill up
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
what are you trying to solve
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
what are you trying to do
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
and what is the cost
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
to go to the last part of it
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
the bill does have a fiscal note
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
and it's it's just it's just an
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
estimated yes i would tell you i would i
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
read as i read it of about ten thousand
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollars now i don't i don't understand
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
how that comes into play but
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
i don't wanna not point out all the
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill
 
01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.149 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill
[Music]

01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:38.159 --> 01:51:40.149 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
i want to have the amendment brought up
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming that that can be done
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
at this time mr chairman
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
no they need it would need to be offered
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
during the executive session but if i
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
i understand your amendment and if i can
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
just maybe clarify the testimony
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
on line six
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
contains the language without obtaining
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
a search warrant
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
that same language on the original bill
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
appears on line 13 without obtaining a
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
search warrant it's in my understanding
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
that the amendment which is amendment
 
01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:17.830 align:start position:0%
that the amendment which is amendment
2021-01

01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
line 6 and line 13 of the original bill
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
by we're saying by saying after
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
repeating a search warrant
 
01:52:28.719 --> 01:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
repeating a search warrant
correct

01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
copy of the amendment if they use give
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
me a thumbs up a thumbs down on their
 
01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:42.390 align:start position:0%
me a thumbs up a thumbs down on their
video

01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
we have it here in the chamber you have
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
the people here it's the easy one easy
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
one i'm talking about
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
i know that this is kind of a
 
01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:13.990 align:start position:0%
i know that this is kind of a
strange

01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
strange
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
but i hope i've explained
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
where i'm coming from and this needs to
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
be resolved in some manner unless
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
people here kind of think oh we're just
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
some town molesters well if we catch him
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
we catch him if we don't we don't and
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
the the materials can be on the internet
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
for the rest of humanity
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
and that's the question the problem that
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm bringing to you and with some
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
corrections to this bill i'm seriously
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can get this into a
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
situation of ought to pass with an
 
01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.669 align:start position:0%
situation of ought to pass with an
amendment

01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
and i will take any questions that
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know maybe it's me i think i'm
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
confused a little bit so the whole
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
essence of this is that if
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
they believe people are dealing with
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
child pornography and everything or
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
exploiting children
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that they have um
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
a warrant before going in
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
and confiscating
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
in a few words yes
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
the question really came down to this
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
man was arrested
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
but at the time they went into his
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
apartment and arrested him
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't take the computer and the
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
parents were saying take the computer we
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
want to knock my kids on
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
and so they needed they would have
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
needed a warrant let me give another
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
example if i had
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
if you had a murder and the guy is shot
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
and the gun is on the floor
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the police walk in
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going to grab the gun they
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
might have to have a warrant before they
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
can pick it up
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
but don't it make some sense that
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to take the gun they're
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
going to examine it
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
who owns it
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
has it been fired is it the same caliber
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
of the wound in the person
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
evidence that the guided dead fired it
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
because he's got residue on his hand or
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
what is the story they're not going to
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
just look at that gun on the floor and
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
go oh that don't mean nothing
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
what the heck guys
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
so they're gonna do something with it
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
but what the parents are asking here is
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
this kid was in a room
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
on a couch
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
while being molested and this was not
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
just a one-time incident this went on
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
for several years
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
the parents thought this guy was okay
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
with that kid they had already
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
investigated him but they didn't know
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
what was going on
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
but in this room is the computer
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
facing the couch looking at it and
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
able if in operation to take pictures
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
or to take video
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
and the parents simply wanted to know is
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
my kid on them
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't that make sense to anybody here
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
who has children who hopes to someday
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
have children and if they were being
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
molested would want to know if their
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
kids now been put on the internet
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
am i right am i wrong
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
you want them to take the computer right
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.719 --> 01:56:54.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.159 --> 01:56:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
so if they went for hope i'm sorry
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
so if um
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
you think
 
01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.550 align:start position:0%
you think
they

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
they're going in
 
01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
because they believe
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
this person
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know have these offenses
 
01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.629 align:start position:0%
you know have these offenses
however

01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
i believe you're saying
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be going in period
 
01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:19.669 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be going in period
because

01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a warrant
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
because when i read the original bill
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
maybe that's where my confusion is
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.629 align:start position:0%
coming in
um

01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
it looks like they see seize the
 
01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:32.709 align:start position:0%
it looks like they see seize the
property

01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
because they believe the person is
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
guilty of computer pornography and
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:46.149 align:start position:0%
everything else
so

01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
however they went and i'm assuming that
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
they might have had a warrant to go in
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
before or they might have just gone in
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
because somebody called and complained
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
and just said um
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
my neighbor you know
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
has been touching my child or whatever
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
you know and um and they go in
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
typically they would take the computer
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
but you're saying if you didn't have a
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
warrant don't take the computer
 
01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:09.910 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:12.229 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying
[Music]

01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes and no
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
like the
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
the complaint could get the police to go
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
in to arrest this men was had been done
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
many times
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
the parents had complained to the
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
manchester police department
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
and they had looked into this matter
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then they finally determined that
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
they were going to arrest this gentleman
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
and when they walked in and they
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
arrested them
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming i don't know
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
police procedure but i'm assuming they
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
have the right to arrest somebody
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
without a warrant that's my
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
understanding but they don't have a
 
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
warrant to grab his computer and
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
therefore they didn't touch his computer
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
it would be the same thing in the sense
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the gun on the floor
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
they they going to arrest somebody but
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going to grab the gun
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a warrant to
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
pick up the gun they got to stop
 
01:59:01.119 --> 01:59:02.870 align:start position:0%
pick up the gun they got to stop
everything

01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
we'll go get a warrant from a judge
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just i can't get out that way that's
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
fine i have no objections
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that they answered
 
01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:14.950 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that they answered
that

01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so what you want is for
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
automatically when they go in to
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
to arrest a suspected child officer to
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
make sure they always take the computer
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
so that they can check to see if there
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
is anything on it
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
is that what you're asking for
 
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes and no
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
no if the guy's got a computer in
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
another part of the house or in another
 
01:59:43.679 --> 01:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
another part of the house or in another
room

01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
no don't let don't you have no right to
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
go touch his computer
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
but if where the molestation is taking
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
place in that room and he's got a
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
computer facing that couch which in this
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
case that was the case
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
there is no way of knowing whether he
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
did or he didn't it would almost need an
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
independent person to look into his
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
computer and not be looking to see what
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
other things he's doing but is this
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
child in his computer on video or
 
02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.669 align:start position:0%
child in his computer on video or
pictures

02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
pictures
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
that would make sense because it's not
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
just indiscriminately
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
but it it is that they
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
should have a warrant to still take his
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
computer because it was
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
it was a part of the crime
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
it was used in the crime not his
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
computer in another room
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
computers and or the components from
 
02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:42.229 align:start position:0%
computers and or the components from
computer

02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
computer
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
can be anywhere
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
they could have been used previously
 
02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
that particular time
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
you ought to seize all the computers
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
take a look and see if there's a problem
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
you know wouldn't you
 
02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you want something to just say
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
mandatory and and if there's something
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you but i've talked
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
to lawyers and i've talked to people and
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
i've talked to the police
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i go back to a statement that i made
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
in presenting this
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
the criminal has more rights than you
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
need the children the parents they got
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh no mr chair i uh i weighed my
 
02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
uh no mr chair i uh i weighed my
questions

02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cameron
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
this to me sounds like we are telling
 
02:02:04.719 --> 02:02:05.910 align:start position:0%
this to me sounds like we are telling
you

02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
telling the priest what procedure they
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
should do
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
so am i correct
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
somebody has got to tell somebody what
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
to do when you make an arrest and you
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
see the the
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
weapon if you will or the the the
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
instrument of the crime
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
do you not think that be the case
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
yes i do but further question
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up question
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
do we know for sure that that computer
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
was never taken
 
02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.229 align:start position:0%
was never taken
yes

02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:02:52.239 --> 02:02:54.070 align:start position:0%
yes
absolutely

02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:02.470 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone thank you
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the last couple of bills
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
that we just heard hearings from on
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
protocols of documentation
 
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
and procedures on evidence gathering
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that streamline the process for
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
this problem specifically
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
and solve future problems across the
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
state and make sure that
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
indeed we are gathering the correct
 
02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:32.870 align:start position:0%
indeed we are gathering the correct
evidence

02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and if i
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly yes that is
 
02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly yes that is
correct

02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative greene
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question
 
02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.350 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question
which

02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
is without a warrant
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
that this could be thrown out at any
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
time but because there is a warrant and
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
they have the evidence then it makes the
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
i would say so but i'm not a lawyer and
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not in that
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
profession and that's why
 
02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:10.390 align:start position:0%
profession and that's why
myself

02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the family that's brought this to me
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to figure out
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't solve a problem
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
because they never ever
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
that computer still exists today to the
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
best of their knowledge unless somebody
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
has as the father said unless somebody
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
has as a recently which makes no sense
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
anyways but taken the computer and
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
thrown it in the merrimack river but yes
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to solve
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
see no further hands raised i want to
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank the representative for assessment
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you all and i hope my parents end
 
02:04:47.119 --> 02:04:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you all and i hope my parents end
up

02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
having a chance to testify
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
oh there they are
 
02:05:18.719 --> 02:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
oh there they are
hi

02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
my my name is scott spence um i am the
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
stepfather of the um child that um was
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
um abused in this case
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
just to um give you a recap what
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
happened in this case was that
 
02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.629 align:start position:0%
happened in this case was that
like

02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative marston said the um
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
the computer was there and present and
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
it had
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
cameras that were available on it
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
um the camera the computer does exist to
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
this day
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
and the reason that we were told that
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
the computer did not
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't taken
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
was that in the c cac interview that was
 
02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:58.149 align:start position:0%
was that in the c cac interview that was
taken

02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
taken
 
02:05:58.159 --> 02:05:59.430 align:start position:0%
taken
um

02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
by my son and my um stepson
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
because my son was the one that actually
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
caught the
 
02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
abuse happening to my stepson
 
02:06:12.070 --> 02:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
um so basically this happened to two
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
children um
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
course of what happened
 
02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:19.350 align:start position:0%
course of what happened
um

02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:20.870 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't mention the computer
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so it wasn't taken
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
and they actually went to the
 
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
perpetrator and asked the perpetrator if
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
he used the computer on the children
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
and he said no so they didn't even
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
bother kind of going after it
 
02:06:38.079 --> 02:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
bother kind of going after it
and

02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
when the we pressed the issue they went
 
02:06:42.159 --> 02:06:43.030 align:start position:0%
when the we pressed the issue they went
to

02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor did go to a judge and
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
asked the judge and the judge said no
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
because it would violate his fourth
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendment rights but at this point the
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
computer was gone from the premises
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
well basically what we would like to be
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
asked with this bill
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
is that when the time of arrest
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
a a search warrant be issued
 
02:07:06.239 --> 02:07:06.950 align:start position:0%
a a search warrant be issued
to

02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
go for the electronic devices so that
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
way they can be checked so that way
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
another family doesn't go through
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
i guess the not knowing of what we've
 
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
and it you know it would bring it to a
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
different level if there was something
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't something hey no problem
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
um you know there's no harm no follow i
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
guess but it
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
there is stuff there and like um
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative testerman said if there
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
is something there
 
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.189 align:start position:0%
is something there
then

02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know a computer can be moved
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
so if there's something in the house it
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
should be it should be checked
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what kind of we were asking is
 
02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:50.069 align:start position:0%
so that's what kind of we were asking is
that

02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
and a kid wouldn't necessarily know for
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
instance my my stepson
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have known if he was being
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
recorded because not only in this
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
computer system there were
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
cameras in the monitors but there was
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
also a camera sitting on top of the
 
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
also a camera sitting on top of the
monitor

02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
so that could have been turned easily
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
and he could have been videotaped he
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
never would have known
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
so basically like
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know we were asking is something the
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
issue at the time of arrest so
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your testimony
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
representative wallace thank you mr
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
question i'm sorry that you had to go
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
through this horrible situation
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding correct that you'd like
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
to see
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's no images of what
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
may have transpired not so much for the
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
purposes of conviction but to prevent
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
further victimization of the victims in
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
these types of situations and to ensure
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
those images do not get out to the uh to
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
the worldwide web
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
correct absolutely um you know we have
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
no idea whether um our son is out there
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
on on
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
in any type of
 
02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:09.030 align:start position:0%
in any type of
um

02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
i guess the the dark web or wherever you
 
02:09:12.079 --> 02:09:12.790 align:start position:0%
i guess the the dark web or wherever you
know

02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
and you know i really don't have the
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
stomach to go searching either you know
 
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.069 align:start position:0%
stomach to go searching either you know
so

02:09:20.069 --> 02:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
we don't want any any other child to go
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
through this or family i should say to
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
go through this and you know i don't
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
want my stepson to be
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the computer one day and oh all of a
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
sudden there he is
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
i mean and once these things were out
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
there it it probably be very difficult
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
to put back but i don't want to be
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
not found and be able to be put back out
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
there sometime later on in the future
 
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:46.790 align:start position:0%
there sometime later on in the future
and

02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
if if it does
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
if images are found
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
it will add to a case against the
 
02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
it will add to a case against the
perpetrator

02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
your testimony sir
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just curious could you elaborate
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit more
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
because it's confusing to me why the
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
judge would not
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
issue a warrant you know
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know i know there is a fourth
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
can you explain a little deeper why the
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
judge if you know
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
you know would refuse a warrant because
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
i would think a warrant would be you
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
know easy to obtain
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
what we were what we were told was that
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
um our both our sons did not mention it
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the cac interview
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that it would violate the
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
perpetrator's fourth amendment rights
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we were told and that's as
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
far as it went
 
02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:49.990 align:start position:0%
far as it went
and

02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
as far as we
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
are concerned
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
in my
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
my view that was unacceptable
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
end of story i think that
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
personally more investigation should
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
have been either taken
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
or that
 
02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:05.910 align:start position:0%
or that
um

02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
something like this should exist so that
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
it could have been taken
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
at at the time of the arrest
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
and you can't i'm sorry if i could
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
elaborate and you you can't rely on the
 
02:11:19.599 --> 02:11:20.950 align:start position:0%
elaborate and you you can't rely on the
child

02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and i'm
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
really sorry that this happened to you
 
02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
and your family
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
i just want to go on the record and say
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
for everyone here we take this on the
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee very very seriously
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
and i want to know
 
02:11:51.679 --> 02:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
and i want to know
if

02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
you would be okay if because the issue
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
really is a lack of streamlined process
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
and procedures of documentation that our
 
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.430 align:start position:0%
and procedures of documentation that our
police

02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
are having in this state would you be
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
okay if
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
this issue were to be resolved in
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
um it all depended upon the wording and
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
such i wouldn't know it's again like i'm
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how i mean
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
as long as the issue was
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
um i guess resolved where the point
 
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:27.510 align:start position:0%
um i guess resolved where the point
where

02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
the the perpetrator possibly isn't
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
getting away with a crime and it's a
 
02:12:38.229 --> 02:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
base basically it's not only
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
what my goal is not only to help the
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
families in knowing or not whether or
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
not that
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
images are possibly not on a computer
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
and getting them off but it's also
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
possibly aiding
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
the police
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
or law enforcement in knowing
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
and getting extra charges on a possible
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
perpetrator so
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's the goal point blank
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
so if it's in this bill or another bill
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
so be it
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and again i'm sorry
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
for what you've had to experience and um
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's really brave and to come before the
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
state and share that with us thank you
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
so much
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm so confused
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill and this is a reflection
 
02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
about this bill and this is a reflection
of

02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
probably me but i guess security on
 
02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
what is proposed here i understand this
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
awful situation that the gentleman from
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
manchester his family went through
 
02:13:39.119 --> 02:13:40.149 align:start position:0%
manchester his family went through
that's

02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:13:40.159 --> 02:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
that's
horrifying

02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
horrifying
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
but as i understand it the original bill
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
would remove the requirement for a
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
warrant to seize electronic devices is
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
and the question of the chair i'm not
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
the question but while we have a witness
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
on the stand maybe
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
delay your parliamentary inquiry after
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
in on past bills we've heard uh
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
testimony from folks on the state police
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
internet crimes unit
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i do know that they investigate
 
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
crimes involving
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
pornography children
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
and computers
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious if any attempt or if you
 
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:38.709 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious if any attempt or if you
know

02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
any attempt was made
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
between the manchester police in this
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
particular unit because it would seem
 
02:14:44.639 --> 02:14:46.069 align:start position:0%
particular unit because it would seem
like

02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
a computer in the same room that the
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
assault took place
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
would constitute
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
for their involvement
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
if that has uh is anything that came up
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
no and actually we've sort of kind of
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
reached back out to that department
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
recently because of this bill coming up
 
02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:09.270 align:start position:0%
recently because of this bill coming up
and

02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:10.870 --> 02:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
basically it's kind of
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
falling on its face again because we
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
actually know where the computer resides
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
to this day
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
and it's fallen on its face again but
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
that was just our personal thing and
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
we've kind of resigned ourselves to
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
the fate of that computer and everything
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
else and that's not the point of this
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
bill is to get anything for ourselves
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's for the future
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
so because this bill came up the
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
manchester police um chief did reach out
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
to us because he had heard of this bill
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
and he talked with us about you know
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
our case and etc and we did um talk to a
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
detective and stuff and
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
he kind of it kind of fell flat on his
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
face so
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
um nothing was
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know nothing went forward on that
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
but we would one would think that it
 
02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
but we would one would think that it
would

02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
do what exactly what you said but no it
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
did not
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i may be
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
dumb about this but i always assumed
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
when they re
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
arrested somebody
 
02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
that they took the computers and whatnot
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
in order to prove their case
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
that that was our assumption as well and
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
that is not the case
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's what thank you for trying out of
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
see no no hands raised i want to excuse
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
the witness and
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the representatives a
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
lot of us have uh the ones that didn't
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
speak i'm sure i can say that we all
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for you and your family
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
chief

02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
chief
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
um alan aldenberg
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman can you hear me
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you listening uh give me the
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak this is in fact the
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
manchester case and
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
we are extremely extremely sensitive and
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
to these cases in this case in fact was
 
02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:45.669 align:start position:0%
to these cases in this case in fact was
um

02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
was thoroughly investigated and the
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
person received an extensive um
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
prison sentence obviously none of the
 
02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
family it never is in these type of
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
cases um unfortunately manchester police
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
department investigates hundreds of
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
these cases a year we have detectives
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
that are very well versed and trained in
 
02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
that are very well versed and trained in
this

02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'll i'm hearing all this testimony and
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day what it comes down
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
to is probable cause
 
02:18:09.599 --> 02:18:10.389 align:start position:0%
to is probable cause
and

02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
that's why we went in front of the judge
 
02:18:12.399 --> 02:18:13.270 align:start position:0%
that's why we went in front of the judge
um

02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
to obtain a search warrant for that
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
computer and there was not enough
 
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
problem cause
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
as so if we're trying to circumvent it's
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
gonna be a dangerous world if we're
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
trying to circumvent
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
the search warrant process um simply to
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
seize a computer that
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
we cannot substantiate that there's a
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe that that's
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
evidence of the crime um that's to me
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's not meant to
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
be insulting to anybody i'm not trying
 
02:18:37.599 --> 02:18:38.870 align:start position:0%
be insulting to anybody i'm not trying
to

02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
dismiss what the family's going through
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
if there's not enough probable cause to
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
seize a computer that may be
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
where the crime took place or another
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
part of the home um
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know based off the investigation we
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
do what we can do
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
and establish as much probable cause as
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
we can to make an arrest and to get
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
search warrants on any case that we
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
investigate no matter what it what it
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
may be so there's already process in
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
place and it's it's called the
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
constitution in my opinion thank you for
 
02:19:07.679 --> 02:19:11.990 align:start position:0%
constitution in my opinion thank you for
listening

02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for your testimony the
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
chairman just didn't want to inquire
 
02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
over with an inquiry and i want to thank
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
you in advance for taking my question
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
so if i just understood your testimony
 
02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:25.429 align:start position:0%
so if i just understood your testimony
correctly

02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
the police department applied
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
for a search warrant to obtain to seize
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
the computer
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
but it was denied by the judge or the
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
court was that correct
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative hopper uh thank you mr
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you chief for uh taking my
 
02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
chair thank you chief for uh taking my
question

02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:48.870 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
from the beginning of this hearing i was
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
rather confused but now i
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
seems like i understand
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
a statement and a question the statement
 
02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:00.790 align:start position:0%
a statement and a question the statement
is

02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're aware that most people
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
who engage in uh abusing
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
children sexually or also typically
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
have addictions to pornography and all
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of other crap
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
why isn't that nexus between um
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
a person who was engaged in sexual
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
sexually abusing a child
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
great probability that he also has
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
information on a computer
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
stated that the computer had to be in
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
the room but the computer could be in
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere you can still videotape
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is how can we rewrite
 
02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
so my question is how can we rewrite
this

02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
so that when somebody is being uh you
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
have uh substantial evidence that
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
somebody is being
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
sexually abused
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
that that in and of itself is probable
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
cause to seize electronic devices that
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
again i think that would be a stretch
 
02:20:59.359 --> 02:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
again i think that would be a stretch
without

02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
without
articulating

02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
articulating
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate level of probable cause
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
to get a judge to sign the search
 
02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
to get a judge to sign the search
warrant

02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
i just there's no way around that if you
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
through the investigation if you do or
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
do not establish enough probable cause
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
to get your warrants um
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's the world we live in
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
rightfully so um
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think you're gonna circumvent
 
02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
that you know this in this case you know
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
in many cases like this the children go
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
through cac interviews very difficult
 
02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:34.150 align:start position:0%
through cac interviews very difficult
interviews

02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
interviews
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
done by trained forensic interviewers
 
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.190 align:start position:0%
done by trained forensic interviewers
that

02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
based off those interviews they may
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
develop additional probable cause that
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
there appears to be in fact that a
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
computer may have been used okay then we
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
can reapply
 
02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
for a search warrant or amend our
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
initial search warrant to try to get
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
into that computer or computers
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
but without that probable cause
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to the judge is not
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.710 align:start position:0%
thank
you

02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.309 align:start position:0%
you
representative

02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
originally i think the
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill if i read it correctly was
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
that you have the right to just grab
 
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
that computer and i agree with you the
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
constitution would probably come down
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
and slap anybody that did that pretty
 
02:22:28.319 --> 02:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
and slap anybody that did that pretty
hard

02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
hard
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
but now
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment says that you have to get
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
a search warrant
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
if i if i walk into your your home and
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
as evidence of the crime that we're
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
investigating and you know the
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative used the
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
the example of a gun on the floor okay
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay there's guns there it's
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
relatively clear that may have been used
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the commission of a crime we are
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
going to lock that residence down and
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to apply for a search more
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
before we remove any property from that
 
02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
before we remove any property from that
home

02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:07.590 align:start position:0%
home
so

02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
just because you you
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to say the amendment's going
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
to say you have to apply for a search
 
02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
warrant well that's what we do now
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
and if there's if there's not enough
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause for a judge to sign that
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
then we're not getting into the computer
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's what the process is now
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to sound i don't mean to
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
i just
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
just to clarify i don't i don't believe
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
anyone in the committee uh finding your
 
02:23:43.030 --> 02:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimony to be demeaning or insensitive
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
by any means
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
we all understand it's a very sensitive
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
subject but
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know the fourth amendment is written
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
as it is and i think that's that's what
 
02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:50.870 align:start position:0%
as it is and i think that's that's what
the

02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
chief is saying and we have to respect
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
especially law enforcement who are
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
impacted by the
 
02:23:56.960 --> 02:23:58.389 align:start position:0%
impacted by the
uh

02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify and understand
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't receive any sense of it
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative yeah just follow up mr
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you uh chief for
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
again with a very sensitive situation as
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
this is and i'm sure you guys did
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
everything you could to get that warrant
 
02:24:19.359 --> 02:24:20.389 align:start position:0%
everything you could to get that warrant
um

02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
now that the bill went to that you're
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to grab the computers which would
 
02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
be against the constitution too you've
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
got to get a search warrant
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know i hate to say it but the bill's
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
really not needed at this point because
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
would that be true
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct borrowing any uh
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
constitutionally accepted uh
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
existency um but in these cases um
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not part of icac but we
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
have people that are but
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
i'd be coupled to say that 100 of the
 
02:24:54.399 --> 02:24:55.270 align:start position:0%
i'd be coupled to say that 100 of the
time

02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
those type of investigations result in a
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
search warrant of a computer
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative pantologist
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i
 
02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i
in

02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:08.389 align:start position:0%
in
mr

02:25:08.389 --> 02:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
mr
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the other representative's
 
02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:11.910 align:start position:0%
and the other representative's
testimony

02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
he said that
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
they did not the judge said that they
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
did not
 
02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:18.550 align:start position:0%
did not
mention

02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
the computer is that the reason
 
02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:23.190 align:start position:0%
the computer is that the reason
why

02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
he could not have a search warrant
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative there was
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
not enough uh sufficient level of
 
02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
probable cause for a judge to sign a
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
search warrant to search that computer
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
now that does not mean that
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know you
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
you don't stop your investigation and
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know if further information comes
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
forward then you can reapply for a
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
search warrant but in my understanding
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
in this case there was no additional
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
information to substantiate that
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
my question is is the way that the uh
 
02:26:02.309 --> 02:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment is written it says
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
may sees the computer after getting a
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
search warrant so it seems like you may
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
do it if you get a search warrant and
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
isn't that the case right now
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative newman you recognize for
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
so just make sure i completely
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
understand it does not require you to
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
get a search warrant and seize the
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
computer in all of the cases that deal
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure you stand your
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
question correctly
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
um are you asking if we'll apply for a
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
search warrant every time in these type
 
02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
of cases with computers are involved
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
representing any qualified question
 
02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes my question is since it says may and

opinion that this

that this law causes you to have to get

a search warrant every time you
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh arrest somebody for this kind of

i'm just frustrated
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
that there has to be some way to get you
 
02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:05.670 align:start position:0%
that there has to be some way to get you
to

02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%

02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
take a look and see if there's something

on that
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's related to the case i know
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's a fourth amendment
 
02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
issue but maybe it is so is there any
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
wording of
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
a law rule or something that would
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%

i understand the frustration i
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
understand the frustration of the family

[Music]
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
but just to assume that something's on a
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
device and for us to just arbitrarily go
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
into it
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
and say if you do that and say you
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
discover stuff
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
that incriminates the suspect and you've
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
done so without a warrant you've now
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
compromised your case
 
02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:01.590 align:start position:0%
compromised your case
um

02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
so again
 
02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
in these type of cases a search warrant
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
will be completed it's already
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%

i don't like to find work or i don't i
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't like to find work around the
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%

it was very concerning to to hear that
 
02:32:04.399 --> 02:32:06.870 align:start position:0%
it was very concerning to to hear that
um

02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the um the group what is it called the
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
innocent project had actually reached
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
out to all of our police departments
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
asking for you know information as to
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
whether they were even compliant with
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
the agreement
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
and from what i heard
 
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
most of them were not compliant
 
02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:27.670 align:start position:0%
most of them were not compliant
um

02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:31.270 --> 02:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
the deputy chief from nashua
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
basically stated that nashua
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
is certified in so many different ways
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
and what have you but we're here
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
representing the state
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
not one town or one city or
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
or anything we're here representing the
 
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
or anything we're here representing the
state

02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
um the citizens of the state
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
so with that said even if only two
 
02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
so with that said even if only two
police

02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
police
departments

02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
departments
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
are compliant
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
it seems like we need to do something to
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
bring the other
 
02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:00.309 align:start position:0%
bring the other
uh

02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
departments across the state in
 
02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:03.270 align:start position:0%
departments across the state in
compliance

02:33:03.270 --> 02:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
with the agreement that was made seven
 
02:33:08.950 --> 02:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
years ago from what i can tell
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
that is my reason for wanting to go
 
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
because obviously
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's not across the state
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
and um in terms of the
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
what's the right date so i can't speak
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
to that but for what the bill is trying
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:36.150 align:start position:0%
to do
to

02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
pull our law enforcement accountable for
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
so again
 
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if anybody else um read
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
any of the documentation that was sent
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
to us from the um innocent project as
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
well as from buzz
 
02:33:57.920 --> 02:33:58.790 align:start position:0%
well as from buzz
and

02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
it was actually was quite moving
 
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
to see that that so many people have
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
worked on this
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
and on a very good bill and that it did
 
02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:08.309 align:start position:0%
and on a very good bill and that it did
pass

02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:34:08.319 --> 02:34:09.750 align:start position:0%
pass
previously

02:34:09.750 --> 02:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
previously
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
um but here we are again like a lot of
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
other bills have passed
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
um to go through this all over again
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
and the testimony of the young lady was
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
really really emotional to me
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
so i just
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
hope that my
 
02:34:28.389 --> 02:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues agree and that we move this
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
yes there was some concern i understand
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
during the testimony but remedies for
 
02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
during the testimony but remedies for
this

02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
well the only remedy is the jury shall
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
be instructed as to whether or not
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's credible evidence of compliance
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
or non-compliance
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's no sanctions to the law
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement or anything else
 
02:34:58.380 --> 02:34:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.390 --> 02:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind just raising your
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
digital hand sometimes the hand being
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
raised off the screen so just i would
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
raise it with visual hand it's actually
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
easier for the chair and uh
 
02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:23.370 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:23.370 --> 02:35:24.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm having
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the innocence project
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea it's it's
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
long overdue
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of cases
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:42.469 align:start position:0%
of uh
that

02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
innocence has not been properly
 
02:35:44.399 --> 02:35:46.070 align:start position:0%
innocence has not been properly
attributed

02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
attributed
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
but here's my problem we've got a law
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
that wants to fix
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
instance budget it's really fixing
 
02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
instance budget it's really fixing
police

02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
procedures or police
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
they told us
 
02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:01.510 align:start position:0%
they told us
[Music]

02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:02.469 align:start position:0%
[Music]
these

02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
several hundred agencies that we sent
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
something to
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
some of them didn't
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
respond so they didn't have procedures
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
in place
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to tell the police to do
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
their job
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
and this isn't the bill for it i i just
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
i understand the issue of people being
 
02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:22.950 align:start position:0%
i understand the issue of people being
concerned

02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:24.550 align:start position:0%
concerned
about

02:36:24.550 --> 02:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
police not doing their job and there's
 
02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
some people who are more concerned than
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
to use that as evidence
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
to pass it bill
 
02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative chestnut and thank you
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
comment representative
 
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
am going to vote against the op to pass
 
02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:56.150 align:start position:0%
am going to vote against the op to pass
motion

02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
and the reason is you know hearing
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
the national police officer speak on it
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
and where i'm having the problem is the
 
02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:06.710 align:start position:0%
and where i'm having the problem is the
date

02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
date
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know why do we have to back up to uh
 
02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
you know why do we have to back up to uh
2019

02:37:11.349 --> 02:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
fine representative that made the motion
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
cannot explain that
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm stuck on that part
 
02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know i've supported a lot of things
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
that the innocent project
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
has brought forward and i do support
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
them i just think
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
this was poorly written in the way
 
02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're going down the path is going to
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
be very problematic for the officers or
 
02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
be very problematic for the officers or
the

02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:41.910 align:start position:0%
the
police

02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:37:45.270 --> 02:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
i would have been a lot happier if they
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
that this was going to start on x date
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know with all the
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
manuals written to make sure that it's
 
02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:57.429 align:start position:0%
manuals written to make sure that it's
in

02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
i would have supported that
 
02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:00.590 align:start position:0%
just the way it's written
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
just the way it's written
[Music]

02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know just it's just very problematic
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
as the officer said
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and again you know i go back to line
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
four where they want to remove the day
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
to such lineups so you know there was
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
really no clear
 
02:38:16.950 --> 02:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
explanation of why
 
02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna do my best to convince both of
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
you to agree to agree with the chair
 
02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
let's see how i do it that's my skills
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
so i agree the online four you know
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
changing data such lineups i didn't find
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the original confusion i think they just
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
but while they're going through the this
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill you might as well clarify if you
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
see language in any bill it never hurts
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
to make it clearer if you see something
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
you see oftentimes it says he
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
shall do this
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
they tend to change say he or she i mean
 
02:38:50.479 --> 02:38:52.070 align:start position:0%
they tend to change say he or she i mean
clarification

02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:53.349 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:55.349 --> 02:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
for prestigious current as of january
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
1st 2019 because my understanding of the
 
02:38:57.439 --> 02:38:58.550 align:start position:0%
1st 2019 because my understanding of the
testimony

02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
is that every 10 years an updated police
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
practices manual come out
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
so the most current one is january 1st
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
2019. i understand that this
 
02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:09.190 align:start position:0%
2019. i understand that this
eventually

02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
maybe come outdated and i would assume
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
that that would be on january 1st of
 
02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
that that would be on january 1st of
2029

02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
2029
 
02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:16.870 align:start position:0%
2029
right

02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
so i would think at the time at that
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
time we would want to
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe revisit that issue then
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
but you're right it did say the latest
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
the problem that's happening and
 
02:39:28.399 --> 02:39:30.309 align:start position:0%
the problem that's happening and
so

02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
if there's a best practices guidelines
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
set up and
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
when it's being applied
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
involving identification of wages there
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
are so many
 
02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
loyal procedures well i can go on all
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
day about it but it just
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
it can lead to false identifications
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
very easily
 
02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
so when you're encouraging the police to
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
follow the best practices it's to make
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
the identification as reliable as
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
possible which would actually support a
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
conviction not necessarily finding
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
someone innocent
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
because that can be for some crimes your
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
only evidence to link the defendant to
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
the crime is the identification
 
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
if the identification procedure is not
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
followed correctly
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
that becomes
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
discredited but now you're most likely
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
going to have yourself a not guilty when
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
you may have had a guilty just because
 
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
the best practices wasn't followed
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
or there was a mistake in the
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
identification i just gave a random
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
example when i
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh the defendant had appeared well there
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
was a lineup of eight photos
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
for the identification process well out
 
02:40:37.270 --> 02:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
of seven of the photos no one had a beer
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
so you understand
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
get it it was like
 
02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
i said what is this where's waldo i mean
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
seriously there's not a single person in
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
the lineup that has a beard
 
02:40:49.030 --> 02:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
except for the defendant and then
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
so talk about an easy identification
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
i just i looked at them like this is
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
i thought that was an egregious use of
 
02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
witness identification and
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
won't go any further than that
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm just explaining it's my opinion
 
02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
that having a identification procedure
 
02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
that having a identification procedure
followed

02:41:09.270 --> 02:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
followed
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
correctly really serves the public it
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
serves the defendant it serves the
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
police it serves everyone but why have
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
best practices if no one's required to
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's just not it's just an idea i mean a
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
lot of money gets spent putting this all
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
together implementing the system
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
if the majority of the police
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
departments have fallen already
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
but that just
 
02:41:33.670 --> 02:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
they won't they will be unaffected by
 
02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:34.389 align:start position:0%
they won't they will be unaffected by
this

02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's just my thought representative
 
02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:38.230 align:start position:0%
that's just my thought representative
chestnut

02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
chestnut
 
02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:39.349 align:start position:0%
chestnut
the

02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:43.349 --> 02:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
your point of order is recognized thank
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
you i believe you've called on mr
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
testament before and the whole committee
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't had a chance to speak and you're
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
calling on him a second time
 
02:41:55.349 --> 02:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative marshall you're
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
the point of all your raising is taken
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
and that by the way was a correct point
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
of order because he's actually
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
discussing the rules of the chair and
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
whether being followed thank you for
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
making a correct point of work i do
 
02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that there's been a lot of
 
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings and what is and is not
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
a correct one
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
the mason's manual does this does
 
02:42:17.270 --> 02:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
suggest that the
 
02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
when you call on any
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee member to speak a second time
 
02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
committee member to speak a second time
is

02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you're supposed to have
 
02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
let everyone speak for the first time i
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
i will say and i'm going to ask i'm
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to plead with you to a drawing
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
point of order the problem with that is
 
02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
that you also want to have a healthy
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst the members as we're
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
in a executive session because i was
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
directing my comments and specifically
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
looking at representative chester and
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
american birth all the time
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
i in order to keep that healthy
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
discussion going i would
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
clearer for them to respond right away
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
to those comments i don't mean any
 
02:42:54.389 --> 02:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
disrespect to any members on the
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee but your point of order is
 
02:42:57.590 --> 02:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually correct
 
02:42:57.600 --> 02:42:58.309 align:start position:0%
actually correct
uh

02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:59.590 --> 02:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
so if you don't withdraw and i'm going
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
to agree with you and then not recognize
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative testament that have
 
02:43:08.309 --> 02:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:08.319 --> 02:43:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
martin

02:43:11.190 --> 02:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
myself are you withdrawing your point
 
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
are you withdrawing your point of order
 
02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chairman
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
hi i'm i'm out you were drawing your
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going over myself listen
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
to mars and you're recognized
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
this isn't my point of order or am i
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing i'm recognizing you to speak
 
02:43:29.910 --> 02:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
now because you haven't spoken yet
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you i at this time i'll point out
 
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
that representative rhodes had her hand
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
up as well on this particular bill
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm good
 
02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
you may be good but your hand was up my
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
hand was up i noticed okay so my point
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
i asked i always ask myself this first
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
question i was taught this when i first
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
came up to the state house
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
what are you trying to accomplish with
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
the bill what are you what problem are
 
02:44:01.349 --> 02:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
you attempting to solve
 
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
well as we listen to the testimony
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
especially from officer
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh testament i may not have his name
 
02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
quite right here or testimony
 
02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
he pointed out that the attorney
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
general's office of new hampshire
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
has a policy
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
for how the police department is going
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
to do it now he cannot as an attorney
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
general go out to every little town and
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
village and hamlet and city
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
and tell them you must follow these
 
02:44:31.279 --> 02:44:32.550 align:start position:0%
and tell them you must follow these
procedures

02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
but they are
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
clarified they are there
 
02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:37.990 align:start position:0%
clarified they are there
and

02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
like pesto verde said
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
nashua falls him he believes manchester
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
follows them being large police officers
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
the point being
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we're not solving any problem with
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's my question and i
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
will at the end of it unless i can get
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
turned over there's no grievance prior
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
to this in my opinion for anything and
 
02:45:04.790 --> 02:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
never brought up any case where the
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
witness in new hampshire
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
had had a wrong identification
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
and last but not least
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any cost to this
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
build but
 
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't there's no
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
no so ultimately in my case and i'm only
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
going to speak to one time i've seen no
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
remedy here
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i too
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
will not vote to ought to pass and will
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
be willing to make a motion to itl
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
well there's an active motion on the
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
floor we're going to see how that works
 
02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:39.750 align:start position:0%
floor we're going to see how that works
out

02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i actually
 
02:45:57.830 --> 02:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with a lot of
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
things been said i
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
i think that this is a this is a classic
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
case of
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
if you fail to plan then
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
you plan to fail
 
02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
and just because you don't always have a
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
situation right here
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's also called being proactive
 
02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
it's also called being proactive
and

02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
one thing that is very consistent is
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of inconsistency
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
i i personally had a situation where
 
02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know my prior life when i sold real
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
estate i was you know getting ready to
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
walk into a vacant helmet as being
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
somebody was stealing all the copper
 
02:46:36.479 --> 02:46:37.429 align:start position:0%
somebody was stealing all the copper
and

02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know like i looked right the guy and
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
said oh my gosh like you're are you
 
02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
seriously stealing the copper
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the guy took off and i had to you
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
know go identify him like an hour later
 
02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:50.790 align:start position:0%
know go identify him like an hour later
and

02:46:50.790 --> 02:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
it was very difficult to do that
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know and i'm reminded of another
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
i was um someone was talking to me about
 
02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
like a study that was done in a room
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
full of college students that they gave
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
a situation where it was like a really
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
stressful situation like a guy came in
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
it was all like a play
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
and everybody almost describes something
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
differently because everybody's brain
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
thinks differently so
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know some people might notice the
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
shoes why somebody else notices the hair
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
i think this actually does solve
 
02:47:25.349 --> 02:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems that
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
you don't really know are out there
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
until it's too late so
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:34.479 --> 02:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
ordnay

02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
ordnay
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
um i will support the ought to pass
 
02:47:43.990 --> 02:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
but um my preference is that we amend
 
02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
the bill to
 
02:47:48.630 --> 02:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
take out the current the date um and
 
02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:49.670 align:start position:0%
take out the current the date um and
actually

02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
we could back put back the
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
language of latest version
 
02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:56.309 align:start position:0%
language of latest version
but

02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
without those changes i'm willing to
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%

thank you um
 
02:49:23.190 --> 02:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this was already said
 
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate you hearing uh the
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
reasons why i'm gonna vote to pass um
 
02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
the goal i believe of our committee and
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
our jobs here
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
is to do our our best
 
02:49:35.439 --> 02:49:36.309 align:start position:0%
is to do our our best
effort

02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:49:38.230 --> 02:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
to protect our people
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
and our police from doing the best jobs
 
02:49:42.309 --> 02:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
02:49:42.319 --> 02:49:43.269 align:start position:0%
that they can
and

02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came up that was
 
02:49:45.359 --> 02:49:46.389 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came up that was
really

02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
um terrifying that um chairman abbas
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
brought up is that like
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
we have the potential here to have
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
guilty people continue to do the crime
 
02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:57.590 align:start position:0%
guilty people continue to do the crime
because

02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:49:59.269 --> 02:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
we have the wrong people because we
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the proper protocols in place
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
this would protect our police from
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
making fair
 
02:50:09.429 --> 02:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
cases and getting the actual criminals
 
02:50:09.439 --> 02:50:10.309 align:start position:0%
cases and getting the actual criminals
and

02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
make them more prepared so our
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system is working
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
efficiently and streamlining across the
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
entire state and with all due respect to
 
02:50:24.309 --> 02:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
my colleague across the aisle i feel
 
02:50:24.319 --> 02:50:25.349 align:start position:0%
my colleague across the aisle i feel
like

02:50:25.349 --> 02:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
making sure the state is running
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
smoothly in every single criminal
 
02:50:32.309 --> 02:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
justice town and city is the aeg's
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility as part of his job
 
02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:37.030 align:start position:0%
responsibility as part of his job

description
 
02:50:40.150 --> 02:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
so with that i think this is a definite
 
02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:47.030 align:start position:0%
so with that i think this is a definite
need

02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%

yes mr chairman thank you and my comment
 
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
is uh i would think that instead of
 
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
having the current
 
02:51:09.910 --> 02:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
version with a date that just current
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
version would cover it so that when the
 
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
next current version comes out it's
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%

02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative welch yes these uh
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
manuals come up from the aeg office
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
they don't come out on a regular basis
 
02:52:36.309 --> 02:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
at one point
 
02:52:36.319 --> 02:52:37.830 align:start position:0%
at one point
earlier

02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
probably 20 years ago
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
got a collection of them from the ag's
 
02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:42.950 align:start position:0%
got a collection of them from the ag's
office

02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
and i took them out to the local place
 
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
in my my uh
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
they were anxious to get them because
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
they hadn't had one for years
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with the date in
 
02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:05.349 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with the date in
here

02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
if we go back to the original
 
02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:08.950 align:start position:0%
if we go back to the original
but

02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can't expect the ag's office to be
 
02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
writing these manuals every year because
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i think the reason this data's in
 
02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:18.309 align:start position:0%
and i think the reason this data's in
here

02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
is because that is the first time
 
02:53:22.950 --> 02:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
that they caught up with the law that
 
02:53:27.030 --> 02:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to respond to something
 
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
that representative green had said about
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
chief chester birdie um one of the
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
things that he did say in his testimony
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
was that the the courts are already
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
holding police accountable for these
 
02:53:47.349 --> 02:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
convictions and if you actually
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
sort of use the same standard you know
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
waiting for a case to get to court um
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
02:53:56.710 --> 02:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
trying to create a situation where you
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
know errors in procedure are kind of
 
02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
brought up in front of the judge and
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
things like that i'm not sure that that
 
02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
happens in every case and that every
 
02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer is qualified to do that and um as
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes and and some of
 
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
the other folks have said
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important to have
 
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
those pre-conviction procedures uh
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
tighten down
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh as as much as we can
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we heard
 
02:54:23.110 --> 02:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
during testimony is that well one of the
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
ways you know that's happening is when
 
02:54:27.349 --> 02:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
police departments are responding to the
 
02:54:27.359 --> 02:54:28.389 align:start position:0%
police departments are responding to the
survey

02:54:28.389 --> 02:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
survey
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
and because the response to the survey
 
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't that great and one of the police
 
02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
departments that evidently didn't
 
02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
respond to the survey was nashua it's
 
02:54:40.469 --> 02:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
just very hard to know if this is
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
happening consistently
 
02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
so to me the remedies seem to be
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
seem to be a very good idea and uh and
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
they also
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
and essentially i think one of the other
 
02:54:53.190 --> 02:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
things that we heard
 
02:54:55.349 --> 02:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
is that the vast majority of police
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
departments are already complying with
 
02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
this this is not going to have a big uh
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
a big impact
 
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
one way or the other but where it may
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
have an impact
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
is on somebody who's improperly
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
identified aware a procedure has been
 
02:55:12.230 --> 02:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
used incorrectly
 
02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:15.030 align:start position:0%
so i'll be voting for it
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
so i'll be voting for it

in this session i i heard uh
 
02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
people say that there are a police in
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that
 
02:55:38.469 --> 02:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
in this session i did in testimony i did
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
not hear anyone testify
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we had police in new hampshire that
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
did not follow
 
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
the ag's memos or procedures
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
i did not hear any testimony like that
 
02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
at all i heard
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that people didn't respond to
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
a sermon
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
but i did not hear any testimony that we
 
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
had police
 
02:56:02.230 --> 02:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire saying
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
we aren't going to follow the ag's
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
memories i did not hear that testimony
 
02:56:07.439 --> 02:56:08.870 align:start position:0%
memories i did not hear that testimony
um

02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
please bear with me if i talk about an
 
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that we don't have in front of
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
us but it has been discussed
 
02:56:15.670 --> 02:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
and we ought to be very careful when we
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
start changing
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
when we start talking about the printed
 
02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:20.389 align:start position:0%
when we start talking about the printed
manual

02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
manual
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
because the printed manual comes out
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and the ag is updating
 
02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
that manual
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
he could update that every week
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
and that updated
 
02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
his copy of the updated memo by uh
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
procedures by with this memos
 
02:56:37.910 --> 02:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
are part of the procedure so it's not
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
not the printed copy we're talking about
 
02:56:44.309 --> 02:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
the a.g is updating that every
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
day he can update that man
 
02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:50.330 align:start position:0%

a lot of people talking in testimony

about the

faulty eyewitness testimony

this bill

it doesn't address it

it doesn't deal with it
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
eyewitness testimony is faulty in itself
 
02:57:18.309 --> 02:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
one of the examples they gave was a poor
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
woman who was being raped and she tried
 
02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
to concentrate
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and memorize this guy's face
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
so she and she went and she identified
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
and she was wrong okay
 
02:57:32.230 --> 02:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
but none of this
 
02:57:34.830 --> 02:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
none of this addresses that
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
none um
 
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
because it's not dealing with eyewitness
 
02:57:41.190 --> 02:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
testimony it was a sad case it has
 
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that bill
 
02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:46.070 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that bill
um

02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:52.469 --> 02:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
i heard testimony
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
um the court shall consider
 
02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:04.469 align:start position:0%
um the court shall consider
yeah

02:58:04.469 --> 02:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
the the court may consider yeah that's
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
all judge's prerogatives
 
02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:13.349 align:start position:0%
all judge's prerogatives
um

02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
so if uh
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
ability to comply

with the ag's procedures
 
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
that is an invisible item intercourse
 
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
and that is something that can be
 
02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:32.550 align:start position:0%
and that is something that can be
considered

02:58:32.550 --> 02:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
considered
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
and may weigh
 
02:58:38.469 --> 02:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
evidence uh at a lower uh value or may
 
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:53.830 --> 02:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
comments were made is there a
 
02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrated need
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
which is always a very important thing

is there a demonstrated need for this

02:59:05.110 --> 02:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
is there a demonstrated need that we
 
02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
have procedures that are already being
 
02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:08.230 align:start position:0%

02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see a demonstrated need
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
is it already on the books
 
02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
yes it's already on the books of the

um i don't see any purpose

[Music]

03:00:16.150 --> 03:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
summarized a lot of things
 
03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
this spill is not
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
solving a problem it's giving a judge
 
03:00:25.670 --> 03:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
some instructions
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is not solving a problem
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
of people supposedly not doing their
 
03:00:35.349 --> 03:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
jobs if we had any evidence of that we
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
don't have any evidence of that but you
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
i just don't see a reason for it
 
03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:49.830 align:start position:0%
i just don't see a reason for it
so

03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:00:51.269 --> 03:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
let me just explain
 
03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
what would happen if an office if this
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
was passed and it's assigned to wall
 
03:00:55.439 --> 03:00:56.550 align:start position:0%
was passed and it's assigned to wall
if

03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:00:58.550 --> 03:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
if a police officer just basically does
 
03:01:01.349 --> 03:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
not follow the procedures as we stated
 
03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the manual from january 2019
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
the remedy
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay well what they're what they're able
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
to do in court this is a pre-trial
 
03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
issue it's just like a motion to
 
03:01:16.389 --> 03:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
suppress uh you know evidence obtained
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
through a search warrant that you
 
03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe with outside the scope of the
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
warrant or the search warrant with
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
getting a problem cause
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
what this will do is if they don't
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
follow that procedure that can be
 
03:01:31.110 --> 03:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
considered as evidence
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
to for the judge to consider whether to
 
03:01:35.830 --> 03:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
suppress the identification
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
if the judge does not want to suppress
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
the identification the judge would be
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
provide a specific jury instruction
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
telling the jury about weighing the
 
03:01:46.230 --> 03:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
credibility of the
 
03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:47.590 align:start position:0%
credibility of the
identification

03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
identification
 
03:01:49.670 --> 03:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
all this is doing is saying and if the
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
police are following this already that's
 
03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:51.750 align:start position:0%
police are following this already that's
great

03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
i don't believe they keep
 
03:01:55.030 --> 03:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
track of the statistics on how many
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
motions to suppress are allowed
 
03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
on suppressing the identifications
 
03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
because they're so fat specific to why
 
03:02:03.990 --> 03:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
identification was suppressed the one
 
03:02:07.030 --> 03:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
that i
 
03:02:09.269 --> 03:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
used an example of we never even got
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
that far to argue with because it was so
 
03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:13.190 align:start position:0%
that far to argue with because it was so
egregious

03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
egregious
 
03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
it was just out the door
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes that will happen
 
03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:17.830 align:start position:0%
sometimes that will happen
but

03:02:17.830 --> 03:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:02:20.389 --> 03:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
this what this does yeah with an officer
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
that does not follow this procedure it's
 
03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:23.429 align:start position:0%
that does not follow this procedure it's
not

03:02:23.429 --> 03:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
that's not the egregious problem it's
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
just provide it does provide an outline
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
remedy what to do when that happens
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
and it leaves the judge of discretion
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
i would argue that there is some
 
03:02:35.830 --> 03:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
discretion the judge has already but
 
03:02:37.830 --> 03:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
this codifies what the judge can can't
 
03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:38.950 align:start position:0%
this codifies what the judge can can't
do

03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
and that would actually uh
 
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
limit the make i think maybe
 
03:02:45.750 --> 03:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
emotions to suppress easier for the
 
03:02:47.670 --> 03:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
defense counsel so i think that's
 
03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
defense counsel so i think that's
important

03:02:49.510 --> 03:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:02:51.269 --> 03:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
so it's the city doesn't have a remedy i
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
think it does
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
but to identify the problem
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
this is the issues of identifications
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that happens in every
 
03:03:03.429 --> 03:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
state and it's it's very common
 
03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
especially when you're dealing with
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
someone who doesn't know i mean there's
 
03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
been a false identification that i've
 
03:03:10.309 --> 03:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
heard of
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
he was identified and i was able to
 
03:03:16.230 --> 03:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
prove he was two hours away
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
he worked in the medical field so the
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
medical doctors were time sensitive so
 
03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
that identification was
 
03:03:23.349 --> 03:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
not even close whether that witness was
 
03:03:26.710 --> 03:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
lying or that witness was mistaken
 
03:03:28.150 --> 03:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
that was really that was really what it
 
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
is what the concern was
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
so it does happen but
 
03:03:34.389 --> 03:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
following the correct procedure
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
i believe would be
 
03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:37.510 align:start position:0%
i believe would be
easier

03:03:37.510 --> 03:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
easier
 
03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement to really do their
 
03:03:41.830 --> 03:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
job but also to women to evaluate the
 
03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
job but also to women to evaluate the
reliability

03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
reliability
 
03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:45.190 align:start position:0%
reliability
follow

03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:03:50.389 --> 03:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the judge not the
 
03:03:53.359 --> 03:03:54.469 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the judge not the
police

03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
police
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
03:03:57.429 --> 03:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
the judge has
 
03:03:59.349 --> 03:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
these various options
 
03:04:02.230 --> 03:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
he has i'm assuming and i'm not
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
and don't intend to get into a court of
 
03:04:04.080 --> 03:04:04.950 align:start position:0%
and don't intend to get into a court of
law

03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm assuming he has those options
 
03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:09.830 align:start position:0%
but i'm assuming he has those options
anyway

03:04:09.830 --> 03:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
what am i giving him news he doesn't
 
03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:12.870 align:start position:0%
what am i giving him news he doesn't
have

03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:04:15.269 --> 03:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
and why am i telling him how to do his
 
03:04:15.279 --> 03:04:16.309 align:start position:0%
and why am i telling him how to do his
job

03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
job
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
well that's a fair statement but i would
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
say that applies to all the rules of
 
03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
say that applies to all the rules of
veterans

03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
so there are qualified rules and
 
03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that apply
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
and this i think this gives a fair
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
amount of discretion uh depending on
 
03:04:32.230 --> 03:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
what how the judge wants to perceive it
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that's really because that's i
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
believe that's the best way to do it
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
because the actual
 
03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:38.790 align:start position:0%
because the actual
uh

03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:40.230 --> 03:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
the issue of whether to suppress or not
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very fact specifically
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
depending on how egregious the uh
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
situation was so
 
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
i think we've had enough discussion
 
03:04:48.790 --> 03:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
everyone's had a chance to speak it's
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
very spoke already you've got your hand
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
hi where was that new man that's where
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
would you like to move the question i'm
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
gonna and for the members i'm only gonna
 
03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:08.469 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i got new
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
information i want to say
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
you do yes
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative when you
 
03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
recognize first
 
03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i believe i'm
 
03:05:22.150 --> 03:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
agreeing with the chairman i think that
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
having a list to go by is something that
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
helps everybody to do the right thing
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
the right way and solves the problem
 
03:05:33.590 --> 03:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:36.870 --> 03:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i agree
 
03:05:38.950 --> 03:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
with everything uh representative true
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
said and then
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
my friend representative muse what he
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
was saying too is that
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
if i understood them correctly that
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
the police are following this
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
so again we come back to why are we
 
03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
03:05:57.030 --> 03:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
but the biggest
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
reason i'm definitely now going to vote
 
03:05:59.680 --> 03:06:01.269 align:start position:0%
reason i'm definitely now going to vote
no

03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
is a good friend of mine
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
a state representative a chairman in
 
03:06:05.040 --> 03:06:06.070 align:start position:0%
a state representative a chairman in
this

03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
building sent me article 23
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
that does not allow and it was a june
 
03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
that does not allow and it was a june
2nd

03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
2nd
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
1784 is when this was uh before
 
03:06:18.550 --> 03:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
article 23 does not allow us to back
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
date anything
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
and this is backdated
 
03:06:25.110 --> 03:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh to january 1st 2019 so that's against
 
03:06:30.230 --> 03:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
the constitution as far as i'm ready so
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
the exposed fact those thoughts let me
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
just verify
 
03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
any rap retroactive retroactive
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
application of laws
 
03:06:40.830 --> 03:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
are unconstitutional i agree that
 
03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
100 right that's the correct statement
 
03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
of law
 
03:06:45.670 --> 03:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
and the exposed factors bus is the
 
03:06:45.680 --> 03:06:46.710 align:start position:0%
and the exposed factors bus is the
federal

03:06:46.710 --> 03:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
constitution also has that so we have it
 
03:06:48.640 --> 03:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
constitution also has that so we have it
twice

03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
twice
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
this is not retroactively going to apply
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
this does not take effect
 
03:06:56.469 --> 03:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
this shall take effect 60 days after its
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
passage so for any mistakes that are
 
03:06:58.080 --> 03:06:59.190 align:start position:0%
passage so for any mistakes that are
made

03:06:59.190 --> 03:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
60 days after this is signed into law
 
03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is not going to apply to this is
 
03:07:05.910 --> 03:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
03:07:05.920 --> 03:07:06.710 align:start position:0%
going forward
so

03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
this does not violate that
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
example of that we had last year was the
 
03:07:13.590 --> 03:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
the raising the smoking age on tobacco
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
they wanted to raise the 21.
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like a great public health reason
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
to do so however there was no
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh it would have applied right away or
 
03:07:23.910 --> 03:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
within a short time period so if you're
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
20 years old and you had a car with
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
cigarettes what you legally owned today
 
03:07:29.830 --> 03:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
would become a crime
 
03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
right and there was no justice
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.230 --> 03:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's an unconstitutional okay because
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
now you're
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
the exposed factor that's the way i
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
looked at that that was they were not
 
03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
being compensated they were also being
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
penalized for something that they were
 
03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
doing that was legal it's called the
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional case to reply
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
retroactively though would be if you
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
didn't even have the cigarettes in this
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
possession anymore but he had them in
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
this possession you still charge someone
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
for what they did at the times d
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
this we're not this is not
 
03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
charging anyone with something
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
in the extent that it is we are
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
you know no no one's been charged with
 
03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
anything they've already this is this is
 
03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
going to apply 60 days after it takes
 
03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
effect it's not applying to anyone
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's been charged already
 
03:08:19.190 --> 03:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
i agree but we're talented if you don't
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
mind mr chairman um we're telling the ag
 
03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
that he has to go back to january 1st
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
2019 so in my eyes we are
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
going back to acting no that's the
 
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's the fate of the man
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
trust me if if it was written that way i
 
03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
would have recognized representative
 
03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:37.780 align:start position:0%
would have recognized representative

03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
and to be honest
 
03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:42.389 align:start position:0%
and to be honest
that

03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:44.550 --> 03:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
i would be surprised that though that
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
there was that egregious constitutional
 
03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
violation would uh
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
even be presented
 
03:08:53.590 --> 03:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm very confident that's not that's not
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
did you hear me
 
03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:21.429 align:start position:0%
did you hear me
no

03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
i would like to move the question
 
03:09:27.910 --> 03:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:30.230 --> 03:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
the dean of the house might recognize uh
 
03:09:31.830 --> 03:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative pratt for the very last
 
03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:33.830 align:start position:0%
representative pratt for the very last
comment

03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:34.950 align:start position:0%
comment
fine

03:09:34.950 --> 03:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
fine
 
03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
03:09:38.309 --> 03:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
i just learned
 
03:09:38.319 --> 03:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
i just learned
today

03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
oh yeah representative that that
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
document is actually updated
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
by attending general so that manual
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
they're talking about it also says
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
um the attorney general can update
 
03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
so uh we are talking about documentation
 
03:09:59.670 --> 03:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
so fluid documents could change daily
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
needs time after it changes for
 
03:10:11.290 --> 03:10:11.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.300 --> 03:10:21.590 align:start position:0%

03:10:22.950 --> 03:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
consistent with the testimony that's
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you um i didn't have confusion
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
around the date
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm very clear on the date now that
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
it is a book that's updated every 10
 
03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:55.590 align:start position:0%
it is a book that's updated every 10
years

03:10:55.590 --> 03:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
years
so

03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:59.110 --> 03:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
for me i believe that you need to keep
 
03:11:01.030 --> 03:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
the date
 
03:11:02.790 --> 03:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
because it's not updated for another 10
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
years so 29 2029
 
03:11:07.750 --> 03:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the testimony from the innocent
 
03:11:12.790 --> 03:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
group from uh buzz
 
03:11:15.269 --> 03:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
if there was a change to this piece of
 
03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
the document
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
it would have been stated
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
we had i think four different um emails
 
03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
sent with with testimony and
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
all through that document
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
nothing of any update to this and that's
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
why they were
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
expressing that we want this to go
 
03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:33.429 align:start position:0%
expressing that we want this to go
through

03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:11:33.439 --> 03:11:34.469 align:start position:0%
through
because

03:11:34.469 --> 03:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
we've they're people that are not
 
03:11:36.080 --> 03:11:37.429 align:start position:0%
we've they're people that are not
following

03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
following
 
03:11:40.710 --> 03:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
their own policy and practice
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
so we might not be able we might say
 
03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
right now today that in new hampshire we
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:48.070 align:start position:0%
don't know
anyone

03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
that um was affected by this however if
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is made
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
made law
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
personally i think you're going to see a
 
03:11:56.800 --> 03:11:58.150 align:start position:0%
personally i think you're going to see a
change

03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:11:59.670 --> 03:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
and you will know exactly what's
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.910 --> 03:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
so for those that are afraid i would say
 
03:12:07.990 --> 03:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill and it really should
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
be um
 
03:12:10.469 --> 03:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
in law
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
in law
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
as it stands
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
i would be curious as to what happens
 
03:12:18.870 --> 03:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
over the next year
 
03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
and we will still be here together
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
before everyone starts yelling at me and
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
say i'm out of order i'm just gonna say
 
03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
now the chair does although this is not
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
a public hearing the chair does have any
 
03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
a public hearing the chair does have any
discretion

03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
to ask a question remember the public of
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
the president and i see
 
03:12:34.150 --> 03:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
albert shearer's president i'm going to
 
03:12:36.389 --> 03:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
ask a single question just one and try
 
03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.560 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
as you can hear us talking about this
 
03:12:46.950 --> 03:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
10-year manual everything's updated
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
every time
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
is that a living document to your
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge or is it something that's
 
03:12:52.790 --> 03:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
updated every 10 years
 
03:12:54.870 --> 03:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
the chair just recognized
 
03:12:56.950 --> 03:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
mr shearer to just answer that one
 
03:13:00.309 --> 03:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
specific question
 
03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
as hard as that is to answer the one
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
specific question
 
03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:04.389 align:start position:0%
specific question
um

03:13:04.389 --> 03:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office may
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
send out a memo now and again on a
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
particular issue but the manual itself
 
03:13:21.030 --> 03:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
is updated only every 10 years
 
03:13:22.710 --> 03:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
so therefore you do not believe that to
 
03:13:24.630 --> 03:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
be a living document
 
03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:25.990 align:start position:0%
be a living document
correct

03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:26.830 align:start position:0%
correct

03:13:38.150 --> 03:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
i i think we should move the question
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:52.880 align:start position:0%

that
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
brought this bill to to ahead so
 
03:18:27.990 --> 03:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
there was a bit of a loophole in the in
 
03:18:30.070 --> 03:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
the law regarding uh employment
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions on registered sex offenders
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh this bill uh simply fixes
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
that loophole closes that that loophole
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know really is not a partisan bill
 
03:18:47.349 --> 03:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh it passed
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:18:51.269 --> 03:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
on on the consent calendar out of the
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
house and um because of the uh the covet
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
issue it was laid upon the table in the
 
03:19:00.150 --> 03:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
senate where it died so the the bill
 
03:19:03.429 --> 03:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
before you today is the exact same
 
03:19:03.439 --> 03:19:05.190 align:start position:0%
before you today is the exact same
language

03:19:05.190 --> 03:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:19:07.590 --> 03:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
that was agreed upon
 
03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
by a bipartisan subcommittee
 
03:19:15.670 --> 03:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is it was reviewed by at the time
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
going off memory the state police the
 
03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.990 --> 03:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
aclu and so at that time all of this
 
03:19:30.630 --> 03:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
language was uh
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
was agreed upon and
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh so like i said this this simply
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
closes a a loophole um that exists in
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
the in the current law
 
03:19:43.349 --> 03:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
and uh with that i'll take any questions
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
represented true
 
03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
um i'm not that good on computers so
 
03:19:59.349 --> 03:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
before i get to your email
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the
 
03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer um and lawyers actually
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
hammered out most of this this language
 
03:20:16.469 --> 03:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
but it allowed registered sex offenders
 
03:20:20.389 --> 03:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
um to be employed in jobs which uh had
 
03:20:24.229 --> 03:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
them on uh repetitive um you know access
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
to minor children and uh and that that
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
was sort of the issue the first case um
 
03:20:35.670 --> 03:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
was revolved around a uh landscaper uh
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
in deerfield and uh you know the the
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
court ruled that the registered sex
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
offender could work as a landscaper
 
03:20:47.870 --> 03:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
hiring and having direct supervisor
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
supervisory role um over minor minor
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
children because the
 
03:20:55.750 --> 03:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
the language in the law
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear enough to prohibit it
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:21:04.470 --> 03:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
that occurred back in um
 
03:21:04.480 --> 03:21:06.309 align:start position:0%
that occurred back in um
[Music]

03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
give me one second my my apologies i
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
have too many screens
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
too many screens open i might have
 
03:21:14.790 --> 03:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
accidentally closed it well i think it
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
was around 2018 2019
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then there was a a second case that
 
03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
ended up coming out and uh that was a
 
03:21:28.870 --> 03:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender who was a ride
 
03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
operator at the deerfield fair again
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
putting him you know uh in a position of
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
of you know not only repeated contact
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
with uh with children but you know close
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
contact uh helping people on and off
 
03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:43.510 align:start position:0%
contact uh helping people on and off
rides

03:21:43.510 --> 03:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
rides
 
03:21:43.520 --> 03:21:44.870 align:start position:0%
rides
etc

03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
etc
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so it's those two uh it's those two
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
cases that uh that really
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
brought to light the need to clean up
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:22:02.399 --> 03:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
representative

03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
what happens in need to protect children
 
03:22:15.830 --> 03:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
at all costs but what happens if this
 
03:22:18.790 --> 03:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
individual works at
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
you know shaw's
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
hannaford's mcdonald's uh market basket
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh convenience store i mean there's kids
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
running around those places all the time
 
03:22:27.920 --> 03:22:29.269 align:start position:0%
running around those places all the time
um

03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know what would happen in that case
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
that this
 
03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
proposed law restrict that
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
um i i apologize to representative uh
 
03:22:41.190 --> 03:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
true uh thank you for your question and
 
03:22:42.710 --> 03:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative brett thank you for your
 
03:22:46.630 --> 03:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
question um so the the answer is is the
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
most definite maybe and and the reason i
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
say that is it really depends on um what
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
the job is right so the the law is being
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
tightened up um
 
03:23:00.229 --> 03:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
a registered sex offender cannot
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
knowingly engage in any employment or
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer service
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
which purpose involves the direct care
 
03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:12.710 align:start position:0%
which purpose involves the direct care
instruction

03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
03:23:12.720 --> 03:23:13.910 align:start position:0%
instruction
guidance

03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
or repeat interaction with a minor so
 
03:23:19.910 --> 03:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
not it's not
 
03:23:22.630 --> 03:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's not that there may be many uh
 
03:23:25.510 --> 03:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
interactions individual interactions
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
with um children with minors
 
03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's the repeat
 
03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
interaction with a minor
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
so if if the person is is you know a
 
03:23:40.710 --> 03:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
manager of a department that is staffed
 
03:23:42.630 --> 03:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know with a minor
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
then no that person couldn't do that job
 
03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
because that's the direct supervision
 
03:23:50.070 --> 03:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
right direct care instruction guidance
 
03:23:53.349 --> 03:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
um over of a minor so
 
03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
so no they couldn't do that now you know
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
could they could they be a a grocery bag
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
or or a cashier um yes as long as the
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
other person or people working that
 
03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:06.790 align:start position:0%
other person or people working that
station

03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
station
 
03:24:10.710 --> 03:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
were not uh were not miners
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question if it
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't i'll take the follow-up
 
03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:17.349 align:start position:0%
doesn't i'll take the follow-up
certainly

03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:19.510 --> 03:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes if i could representative
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know these people have to work
 
03:24:29.190 --> 03:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
somewheres and usually if you have a
 
03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
conviction i'm assuming you're working
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
at a lower paying job
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
um which possibly would be mcdonald's
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
but i did see 13 an hour
 
03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:38.790 align:start position:0%
but i did see 13 an hour
um

03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:40.870 --> 03:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
offered but
 
03:24:43.349 --> 03:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know i i guess
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know how would we regulate that
 
03:24:48.630 --> 03:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know so the individual doesn't lose
 
03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
his you know to end back up in jail once
 
03:24:51.439 --> 03:24:52.229 align:start position:0%
his you know to end back up in jail once
he's

03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
he's
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know served his time
 
03:24:56.309 --> 03:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
um you know if he was working at
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
mcdonald's because there is a lot of
 
03:24:59.429 --> 03:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
kids there
 
03:25:01.750 --> 03:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
but she's trying to name any uh
 
03:25:03.750 --> 03:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
businesses or franchises specifically
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
just sent the wrong implies the wrong
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
message i understand why i'm using a
 
03:25:09.349 --> 03:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
hypothetical all right your reference to
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
the business was only a hypothetical yes
 
03:25:12.239 --> 03:25:13.990 align:start position:0%
the business was only a hypothetical yes
password

03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
password
 
03:25:15.670 --> 03:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative for the
 
03:25:17.590 --> 03:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:18.630 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

03:25:18.630 --> 03:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
for for one thing i will not
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
um i will not agree with the supposition
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
um that people
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
right under the registered sex offender
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
program are necessarily um in lower
 
03:25:35.429 --> 03:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
paying jobs i i don't i don't believe
 
03:25:40.630 --> 03:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:43.590 --> 03:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
is not to deny people
 
03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
a right to work a right to earn a living
 
03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:50.469 align:start position:0%
a right to work a right to earn a living
and

03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
and to participate
 
03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
in society
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
is to make sure
 
03:26:02.229 --> 03:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
that registered sex offenders
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
that are not supposed to be
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
near minors
 
03:26:08.790 --> 03:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
are not employed
 
03:26:10.030 --> 03:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
in occupations
 
03:26:10.040 --> 03:26:11.429 align:start position:0%
in occupations

that

that
engages

03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
which the purpose involves a direct care
 
03:26:21.030 --> 03:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
instruction guidance
 
03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:21.910 align:start position:0%

or

03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:26:21.920 --> 03:26:23.590 align:start position:0%
or
repeat

03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:25.110 align:start position:0%
repeat
interaction

03:26:25.110 --> 03:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
with a minor so
 
03:26:30.790 --> 03:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
that the the person should not be
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
holding a job
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
where they have repeat interaction with
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
a minor
 
03:26:37.439 --> 03:26:38.950 align:start position:0%
a minor
now

03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
sexual offenses are varied and i'm
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not an expert in that area but
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that we know and
 
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
i believe is is common knowledge or at
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
least relatively common knowledge
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
if sexual predators
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
often groom their victims
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
before the crime is perpetrated
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the grooming activity
 
03:27:07.670 --> 03:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
takes place over a period of time over
 
03:27:07.680 --> 03:27:09.590 align:start position:0%
takes place over a period of time over
multiple

03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
03:27:12.389 --> 03:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
dare i say repeat interaction
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
with fed miners so this bill prohibits
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
that that opportunity to be made
 
03:27:24.150 --> 03:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
available to a registered sex offender
 
03:27:27.190 --> 03:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
so it it it doesn't preclude them from
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
holding a job which has interaction with
 
03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
interactions or potential interactions
 
03:27:37.269 --> 03:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
with minors what it prohibits is that
 
03:27:37.279 --> 03:27:38.550 align:start position:0%
with minors what it prohibits is that
repeat

03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
03:27:42.309 --> 03:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
interaction with a minor so that they're
 
03:27:42.319 --> 03:27:43.510 align:start position:0%
interaction with a minor so that they're
not

03:27:43.510 --> 03:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
working with that same person you know
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
each day or each week or each month and
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
and the the intent of that is to make
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
sure that that sort of grooming and
 
03:27:58.790 --> 03:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
communication um
 
03:27:58.800 --> 03:28:00.150 align:start position:0%
communication um
pathway

03:28:00.150 --> 03:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
03:28:03.269 --> 03:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
is is not allowed to to create itself
 
03:28:05.670 --> 03:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's the intent of the bill and
 
03:28:07.269 --> 03:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
and that was you know
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that was the intent of the
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
original law right was to to prohibit
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
this this type of employment
 
03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
it not only protects the children i mean
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
clearly that's our priority here but it
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
also protects the registered sex
 
03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
also protects the registered sex
offender

03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
offender
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
by um
 
03:28:27.910 --> 03:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
preventing them from being in you know a
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
a situation that
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
potentially could make recidivism um
 
03:28:35.590 --> 03:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
that much easier so this this really
 
03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:36.790 align:start position:0%
that much easier so this this really
benefits

03:28:36.790 --> 03:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
both populations
 
03:28:40.870 --> 03:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that that makes
 
03:28:42.790 --> 03:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense
 
03:28:45.190 --> 03:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative pandalagas
 
03:28:47.670 --> 03:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:28:50.070 --> 03:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question what
 
03:28:51.269 --> 03:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
you are
 
03:28:52.710 --> 03:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
are you saying
 
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
that these people should not be in
 
03:28:59.590 --> 03:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative and it's a good question
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
and absolutely not i am not saying that
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be uh that they should
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying they should be precluded
 
03:29:11.030 --> 03:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
from management positions but they
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
should be precluded from managing minors
 
03:29:17.590 --> 03:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
right because if you're managing
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
somebody that is a position that
 
03:29:24.070 --> 03:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
requires repeat interaction with the
 
03:29:24.080 --> 03:29:25.190 align:start position:0%
requires repeat interaction with the
employee

03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:29:27.190 --> 03:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
and if the employees are minors then
 
03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:28.710 align:start position:0%
and if the employees are minors then
that

03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
is not management position uh for a
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender so um you know
 
03:29:37.190 --> 03:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
if they're managing the accounting
 
03:29:39.190 --> 03:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
department which presumably would be
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
staffed um with adults
 
03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's there's no issue there but to to
 
03:29:48.190 --> 03:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
have them uh be the manager of you know
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
cashiers or or stocking clerks things
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
jobs like that that are often uh staffed
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
by miners that that would not be that
 
03:30:01.190 --> 03:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
would simply not be appropriate
 
03:30:02.790 --> 03:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:05.830 --> 03:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.840 --> 03:30:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:30:10.389 --> 03:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh allowing or for taking
 
03:30:16.950 --> 03:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
03:30:18.309 --> 03:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things just looking at the
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
way that the the bill is worded um
 
03:30:21.520 --> 03:30:22.389 align:start position:0%
way that the the bill is worded um
the

03:30:22.389 --> 03:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:25.190 --> 03:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
language is being struck uh
 
03:30:27.030 --> 03:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
used to seems to have taken an approach
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
before of specifically naming
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the professions that would be impacted
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
or the types of jobs that would be
 
03:30:33.359 --> 03:30:34.550 align:start position:0%
or the types of jobs that would be
impacted

03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
the the changes
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
make it must make it much less uh make
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
it i'm sorry make it much more ambiguous
 
03:30:42.479 --> 03:30:43.510 align:start position:0%
it i'm sorry make it much more ambiguous
and

03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
how you think a person would know
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
if they were in a job that
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be if they had this kind
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:57.990 --> 03:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
when i originally filed the bill um
 
03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
that those exemplars
 
03:31:10.389 --> 03:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
um were not crossed out and
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
that that was a decision that was made
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
by the subcommittee uh in the previous
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
term and again this this bill this bill
 
03:31:18.399 --> 03:31:19.429 align:start position:0%
term and again this this bill this bill
passed

03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
last year unanimously through the
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee and on a voice vote on the
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
floor of the house
 
03:31:29.190 --> 03:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
it was decided by the subcommittee at
 
03:31:30.550 --> 03:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:31:30.560 --> 03:31:31.750 align:start position:0%
the time
that

03:31:31.750 --> 03:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:35.190 --> 03:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
to make these examples because it's it
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
both strikeouts start with including but
 
03:31:41.190 --> 03:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
not limited to
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:31:45.750 --> 03:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
the question was should there be such a
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
laundry list
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
provided because it's not it's not
 
03:31:52.710 --> 03:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
that list is not a narrowing of the
 
03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
it was included language originally to
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
sort of illustrate examples but it they
 
03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
both places it struck out it starts
 
03:32:06.550 --> 03:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so it it was believed by last year's
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that it actually made the
 
03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
bill more confusing to include that sort
 
03:32:17.110 --> 03:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
of laundry list of um
 
03:32:19.510 --> 03:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
of occupations
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders when uh when
 
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
they're released right and and are
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
allowed to enter into society um
 
03:32:28.479 --> 03:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
allowed to enter into society um
they

03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
they have people that explain to them
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
the do's and the don'ts right that they
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
have to follow um going forward so a
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender
 
03:32:42.150 --> 03:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
if they move from uh one community to
 
03:32:44.070 --> 03:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
another right they have a specific
 
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
amount of time at
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
in which they must notify that they've
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
moved right they have to notify the
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
authorities so all of these and that's
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's just a restriction on registered
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
sex offenders there's a there's a lot
 
03:33:00.790 --> 03:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of them
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
because i village residents
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i've got somebody coming
 
03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
over on the audio
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is simply another um
 
03:33:13.990 --> 03:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
restriction and
 
03:33:17.110 --> 03:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
it was um
 
03:33:19.830 --> 03:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
if that and that's why the um in part
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
two paragraph b
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
um was was added as an extra protection
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
really for the for the for the
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender um you know that
 
03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
they would be notified upon employment
 
03:33:36.710 --> 03:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
um of this of this prohibition so you
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
know we're trying to to protect
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
everybody we're not trying to to create
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
added penalties we're we're really just
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that you know the
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender is not put into
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
a position that um you know could
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
potentially cause them to backslide if
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
you will um and obviously the primary
 
03:33:57.830 --> 03:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
reason for the restriction is to protect
 
03:33:57.840 --> 03:33:58.950 align:start position:0%
reason for the restriction is to protect
minors

03:33:58.950 --> 03:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
minors
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable uh in our in our
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
community and so that that's why the
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee last year had chosen to to
 
03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
strike the laundry list
 
03:34:10.389 --> 03:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
03:34:13.990 --> 03:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
represent you recognize for a follow-up
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%

i just wanted to confirm that the bill
 
03:34:23.190 --> 03:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
from last year that we're talking about
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
is hb 1462 which was actually heard by
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
the labor committee not by criminal
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
justice is that correct
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%

03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
number um and that was the committee
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
that it had been assigned to um last
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
term i i never i i never said that this
 
03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%

make that clarify uh that that clear in
 
03:34:53.830 --> 03:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
my my opening remarks but yes you you
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
are absolutely correct in both of those
 
03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:57.349 align:start position:0%
are absolutely correct in both of those
points

03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:35:03.190 --> 03:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
03:35:05.840 --> 03:35:07.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
the risk of what hipping this uh bill
 
03:35:13.510 --> 03:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
something i don't like when people do
 
03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
mine and i'm trying to do it but what
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
would happen if this passes to people
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
who already
 
03:35:20.469 --> 03:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
hold positions that would be covered
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:23.269 align:start position:0%
under this bill
um

03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
who are to the best of anyone's
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge not doing anything illegal or
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
on board towards minors with interact
 
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
would they be forced would they lose
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
their jobs or
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.269 --> 03:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
so if if the
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
if the bill is is passed as it's before
 
03:35:44.469 --> 03:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
us um it would take
 
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
take effect uh next january first
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
and at which point yes if a registered
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
sex offender
 
03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:54.229 align:start position:0%
sex offender
is

03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
in an occupation
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
that gives them repeat interaction with
 
03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
a minor
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
that yes they would have to they would
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
crawley you're recognized for a
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you mr chairman
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
i guess again along those same lines of
 
03:36:17.670 --> 03:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
impacts on labor in the event that one
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
of these individuals
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
holding a position where they are not
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
interacting with minors
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
and then a minor is hired by someone
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
other than them
 
03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
is again the individual
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
03:36:39.269 --> 03:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative it's uh certainly an
 
03:36:39.279 --> 03:36:40.469 align:start position:0%
representative it's uh certainly an
interesting

03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
03:36:40.479 --> 03:36:42.070 align:start position:0%
interesting
hypothetical

03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
hypothetical
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the registered sex offender is
 
03:36:47.590 --> 03:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
required to notify their employee
 
03:36:50.309 --> 03:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
employer of their status as a registered
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
sex offender
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:36:58.389 --> 03:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
the hiring and firing decisions by any
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
business are made by the business owners
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
or or managers
 
03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:03.590 align:start position:0%
or or managers
so

03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:04.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:37:04.870 --> 03:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's not impossible to conceive
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
that a business may choose to
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
hire a minor into a position
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
and if the manager of that position was
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
a registered sex offender they would no
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
longer be
 
03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%

representative for taking my question
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
um of which i have
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
two and hopefully i'll be recognized for
 
03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:51.429 align:start position:0%
two and hopefully i'll be recognized for
further

03:37:51.429 --> 03:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:37:51.439 --> 03:37:52.389 align:start position:0%
further
uh

03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
in the first place i'm questioning
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
the validity of
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
the last time i said according to you of
 
03:38:03.429 --> 03:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
striking out
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
all of that stuff about
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
and then you went on and stated a lot
 
03:38:15.429 --> 03:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
which i've seen before in many instances
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
on different things that you really want
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
to be sure you know that teachers
 
03:38:20.399 --> 03:38:21.510 align:start position:0%
to be sure you know that teachers
coaches

03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
coaches
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
little league people like that people
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
that work at camp counselors and scout
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
masters and girl scout masters
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
school administrators
 
03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
why are you striking that out instead of
 
03:38:37.750 --> 03:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
more or less leaving it in to amplify
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
that you don't want them around those
 
03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:41.990 align:start position:0%
that you don't want them around those
kids

03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
03:38:45.510 --> 03:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative again
 
03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:47.190 align:start position:0%
representative again
um

03:38:47.190 --> 03:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:50.229 --> 03:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
the bill was submitted by me last year
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the committee referred it to
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for work and it was the
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
decision of the subcommittee not my
 
03:39:00.950 --> 03:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
decision again the these strikeouts were
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
not struck out in the original
 
03:39:05.190 --> 03:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
submission of the bill last year
 
03:39:08.309 --> 03:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
it was the subcommittee that chose to
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
strike that laundry list
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee had a working
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
working session
 
03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
um at which
 
03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
um at which
the

03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
the people it attended was a
 
03:39:22.710 --> 03:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee myself representatives from
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
state police representatives from
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general um attorney general's
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
office with specific expertise in this
 
03:39:33.510 --> 03:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
the american civil liberties union and
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:39:40.229 --> 03:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of thought and discussion
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
went into um the changes the the
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
basically the amendment to the bill
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
that i originally
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
submitted and and it was that
 
03:39:52.469 --> 03:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that chose
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
to strike that language
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
so whether that language
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
is struck
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
and and to make sure we're being
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
specific starting uh near the end of
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
the end of 17
 
03:40:15.190 --> 03:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
and 18
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
it has no effect
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
on the what the bill does right it it is
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
simply um
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
language that lists
 
03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:29.110 align:start position:0%
language that lists
examples

03:40:29.110 --> 03:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
examples
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
so whether that language is in or out
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
does not change the effect of the bill
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative marston you're recognized
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and i appreciate your comments
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
to that extent uh
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
if i were to consider this bill i would
 
03:40:52.469 --> 03:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
like to see an amendment put in that
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
would make those changes back
 
03:40:57.990 --> 03:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
pick out those lines struck i also do
 
03:41:01.830 --> 03:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
like the idea that you have a
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
section two b
 
03:41:06.469 --> 03:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
which states about what the public and
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
private employer shall do
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's that's a great
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation going forward that
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
states they got to make sure if they
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
have they can't hire somebody if they
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
got kids involved but it doesn't get
 
03:41:20.640 --> 03:41:21.830 align:start position:0%
got kids involved but it doesn't get
into

03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:41:24.309 --> 03:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh it does make private or public and
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that i think what you're
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
doing is trying to restrict employment
 
03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:31.030 align:start position:0%
doing is trying to restrict employment
and

03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
with that being said i'd like to see the
 
03:41:35.590 --> 03:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
lines put back in
 
03:41:37.900 --> 03:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
where would you concur
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:39.429 align:start position:0%
where would you concur
[Music]

03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
was there a question
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
yeah at the end i said would you concur
 
03:41:46.150 --> 03:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's a question with the statement
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative um so to be fair um i i
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate the compliment on
 
03:41:59.190 --> 03:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
section two part b
 
03:42:02.550 --> 03:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
um that language was actually um from a
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
former state rep from i believe
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
brookline um
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
who who crafted that language and the
 
03:42:11.349 --> 03:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
next time i see him i'll be
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
if the question if i understand the
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
question correctly and if i don't please
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
03:42:23.590 --> 03:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
the question is would i as the prime
 
03:42:26.150 --> 03:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
be open to
 
03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
removing the strikeout that starts at
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
the end of nine and goes through 12
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
and removing the strikeout that begins
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
basically halfway through 17 and goes
 
03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
through 18.
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
if that's the question then my answer
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:42:50.469 --> 03:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
yes it would not bother me if if a
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee member
 
03:42:55.110 --> 03:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
filed an amendment to
 
03:42:57.510 --> 03:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
put that language back in to remove that
 
03:43:01.190 --> 03:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
strikeout because it has no effect
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
on the working of the bill
 
03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would caution
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
i tended to agree
 
03:43:10.229 --> 03:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
and with the the other uh experts
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
that the the bill is
 
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
more clear
 
03:43:22.150 --> 03:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
and cleaner without that language in it
 
03:43:23.830 --> 03:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
but i would not be opposed to that
 
03:43:26.790 --> 03:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
language being put back in as it's shown
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
on on
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
the paper in front of us
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
at the very end um paragraph three
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
roman numeral
 
03:43:52.560 --> 03:43:53.670 align:start position:0%
roman numeral
is

03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:43:54.710 --> 03:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
only two
 
03:43:54.720 --> 03:43:55.990 align:start position:0%
only two
teachers

03:43:55.990 --> 03:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
is there was this whole situation
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you for
 
03:44:09.590 --> 03:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
the question if you could just give me
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh one because this is
 
03:44:14.070 --> 03:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay it's a very serious matter if you
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
give me one second just to re-read
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph three so i can answer
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
intelligibly i would
 
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
be obliged
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
please take your time you may read the
 
03:44:25.120 --> 03:44:26.630 align:start position:0%
please take your time you may read the
paragraph

03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
so the the answer is um
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
no so
 
03:44:42.319 --> 03:44:44.389 align:start position:0%
no so
this

03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
this

existing rsa
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
03:45:12.560 --> 03:45:13.590 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
is

03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
because this this this is um

um thank you representative revell i do
 
03:46:50.389 --> 03:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
you currently know how many sex

thank you for the question i do not
 
03:47:00.150 --> 03:47:00.160 align:start position:0%

thank you you're recognized for a
 
03:47:03.189 --> 03:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
so potentially
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
we have no idea
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
how many of these people will be
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
immediately unemployed and have zero
 
03:47:13.189 --> 03:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
resources available in place or
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
structure set up for situational
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
or do you sorry do you have any
 
03:47:27.510 --> 03:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
resources available or protocols put in
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
place from for maybe a lot of people
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we could be putting in
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
a homelessness situation a starvation uh
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
situation or any of these situations
 
03:47:42.309 --> 03:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
that they that might be out of their
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
control once we
 
03:47:47.590 --> 03:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
um discontinue their employment across
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
the entire state
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so you've asked
 
03:47:53.269 --> 03:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
me three questions

um similar but different so which which
 
03:47:56.239 --> 03:47:57.349 align:start position:0%
um similar but different so which which
question

03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
if i could take them one at a time if
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
you could if you could give me your
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
questions one time
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
no if you could re-articulate a question
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
that i could answer i would be obliged
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
this answers the question
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i apologize to the chair please ask
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
one question at a time
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
everyone remember the committee you
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
eliminated two questions your witness at
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
the approach of the chair
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
president you already asked one question
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
of this witness earlier
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
so please just ask a single question
 
03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
within the chair discretion to
 
03:48:34.150 --> 03:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't state have
 
03:48:38.950 --> 03:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
any available resources
 
03:48:41.189 --> 03:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
for an unknown number that you want to
 
03:48:44.070 --> 03:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
make a law for to provide
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the after effect that they will be
 
03:48:46.720 --> 03:48:50.630 align:start position:0%
in the after effect that they will be
unemployed

03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
one

03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
i will i will suppose
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the number of individuals that this
 
03:49:01.680 --> 03:49:02.950 align:start position:0%
that the number of individuals that this
bill

03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
will impact
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
will likely be
 
03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:07.830 align:start position:0%
will likely be
limited

03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
limited
 
03:49:07.840 --> 03:49:08.630 align:start position:0%
limited
and

03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
i make that statement going off memory
 
03:49:14.469 --> 03:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
of discussions from over a year ago um
 
03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
primarily from the representatives from
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it was the aclu
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
um it might have been a different group
 
03:49:25.110 --> 03:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
that sort of tracks and and works with
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
these people
 
03:49:30.070 --> 03:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's been two cases brought
 
03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
it seems very limited in scope
 
03:49:35.189 --> 03:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
does have
 
03:49:37.439 --> 03:49:38.469 align:start position:0%
does have
resources

03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
resources
 
03:49:42.229 --> 03:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
and makes resources available
 
03:49:42.239 --> 03:49:43.429 align:start position:0%
and makes resources available
to

03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:49:43.439 --> 03:49:44.790 align:start position:0%
to
poor

03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%

03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
to needy
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
to unemployed
 
03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%

persons

03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
persons
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
we have we have a fantastic food bank
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
communities have food pantries
 
03:49:59.680 --> 03:50:00.870 align:start position:0%

uh that are available to people in need
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so to to answer the question does
 
03:50:15.910 --> 03:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
the does the state have programs uh to
 
03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
take care of people that that may uh

the chair last year
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
um who uh matter of fact brian sullivan
 
03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
that did a great job on the subcommittee
 
03:51:28.070 --> 03:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
on this bill on making the proper
 
03:51:28.080 --> 03:51:29.110 align:start position:0%
on this bill on making the proper
changes

03:51:29.110 --> 03:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:51:31.269 --> 03:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones the committee
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
there that made that deal with labor all
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:51:36.309 --> 03:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
and these here these different cases
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
understand and knew the needs for this
 
03:51:41.110 --> 03:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
bill so i have to compliment them
 
03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:42.469 align:start position:0%
bill so i have to compliment them
because

03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
like representative revell said this
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't him that made those changes this
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
one bill was in the hands of the
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee okay it was very definitely
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
non-partisan but i complement the chair
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
because he was the one that really
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
pushed and did a great job but anyways
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
this here bill is more of a housekeeping
 
03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:00.790 align:start position:0%
this here bill is more of a housekeeping
bill

03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:52:03.030 --> 03:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the language tightening up
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
the language uh with many hands in it to
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that the language was proper
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good bill it makes sense
 
03:52:13.670 --> 03:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
and if you take a look at i use
 
03:52:15.910 --> 03:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
manchester for any area
 
03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
um they were asked how many people um
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
while you were talking i did a google
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
search on uh
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know uh sexual offenders in new
 
03:52:25.750 --> 03:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the first thing that
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
popped up was 2500 in manchester
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh and then i'm sure i have about
 
03:52:34.469 --> 03:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
15 in my district here in londonderry
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is they already know
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
per other laws that are out there uh
 
03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
that they do not work with minors they
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
do not uh hang out with minors they do
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
not try to groom miners okay that that
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
stuff's already another laws because i
 
03:52:51.030 --> 03:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
believe there's about another five or
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
six laws that pertain to um predators
 
03:52:55.520 --> 03:52:56.229 align:start position:0%
six laws that pertain to um predators
so

03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
what is very important as a former human
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
resource manager when i retired from the
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
marine corps was
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
section b
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
which is important because this is
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
something that human resource management
 
03:53:10.150 --> 03:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
under hiring people should say that a
 
03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
public or private employer shall either
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
verbally are in writing
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
advise an applicant for an employment or
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer position that position applied
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
for me involved contact with miners
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
which may be prohibited under the
 
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
section if the applicant was convicted
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
in this way okay just any jurisdiction
 
03:53:33.189 --> 03:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh any of the offenses specified in
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph for this section
 
03:53:37.349 --> 03:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
that was dissected with the committee
 
03:53:38.790 --> 03:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
last time and they came up with some
 
03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
great language which they're cutting off
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
the past they're actually doing the job
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the parole officers because the
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
parole officers already know
 
03:53:49.030 --> 03:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
that there are people that they're
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
watching in supervising do not get jobs
 
03:53:55.510 --> 03:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
with children so that's already done new
 
03:53:57.269 --> 03:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a great record of
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
protecting the children democrats and
 
03:54:01.510 --> 03:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
republicans uh in the labor and in
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
criminal throughout the years of my time
 
03:54:05.429 --> 03:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
have done an awesome job even in
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
children and family law
 
03:54:07.120 --> 03:54:07.990 align:start position:0%
children and family law
so

03:54:07.990 --> 03:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
this language
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
already passed it would have already
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
been in law if culver didn't come
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
forward because it already passed the
 
03:54:15.520 --> 03:54:16.469 align:start position:0%
forward because it already passed the
house

03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
we all supported it on both sides so i'm
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
hoping that
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
we move forward with this bill pass it
 
03:54:25.510 --> 03:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
one more time and let's let's it's a
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
children's protection bill basically and
 
03:54:30.150 --> 03:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's just reinforcing the laws that are
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
already in place and that's all i have
 
03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:40.469 --> 03:54:40.479 align:start position:0%

you for the question yeah i mean that's
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
fine you could do that but what you're
 
03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
doing is you're you're changing all
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
these duty experts that came in
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
and came up with this language
 
03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh and worked with the labor
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
department under chairman sullivan there
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
and uh you know which came up with a
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
great bill and they thought the words
 
03:55:45.910 --> 03:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
that were in there
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know they tightened it up so if you
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
want to open it back up and make a
 
03:55:51.429 --> 03:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
little more confusing uh with more
 
03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
language in there that's fine i i
 
03:55:53.199 --> 03:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
language in there that's fine i i
respect

03:55:54.150 --> 03:55:54.160 align:start position:0%

03:55:55.750 --> 03:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you want as long as we're
 
03:56:00.950 --> 03:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative pandalakis
 
03:56:05.670 --> 03:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:56:07.590 --> 03:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
03:56:07.600 --> 03:56:08.710 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:56:11.910 --> 03:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
this really clarifies this bill really
 
03:56:11.920 --> 03:56:13.590 align:start position:0%
this really clarifies this bill really
clarifies

03:56:13.590 --> 03:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
03:56:16.630 --> 03:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
miners which is supposed to be in it
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
anyway and the other language that was
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
in there was very confusing
 
03:56:25.110 --> 03:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
am i right i thank you for the question
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
now representative you are 100 right
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
because i think even ben berudi and you
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
know the other republicans on that
 
03:56:33.269 --> 03:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
committee there thought the same thing
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
why it was important to them to change
 
03:56:35.120 --> 03:56:36.550 align:start position:0%
why it was important to them to change
it

03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative gabriel
 
03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:47.750 align:start position:0%
representative gabriel
um

03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to remember
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
when we kind of went through this last
 
03:56:53.670 --> 03:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
term and i guess there's different
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
and what have you so
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly i think there
 
03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
was a bill that talked to this a little
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
bit but it also talked to the different
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
degrees that a person
 
03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember what the numbers
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
were whether it was like a degree one
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
two three or something like that
 
03:57:18.800 --> 03:57:19.670 align:start position:0%
two three or something like that
that

03:57:19.670 --> 03:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:22.150 --> 03:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
allowed sex offenders to do certain
 
03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
things based on whatever level they were
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
if i remember something like that
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
do you know if any anything like that
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
i i remember um
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
something like that i think
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative penalakis are probably no
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
better than i am since she's she's kind
 
03:57:39.269 --> 03:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
of one of the grooves there and criminal
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
law and had a probably better memory
 
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
than i do so i know there was something
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
that came further on the different
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
stages of groups within the sexual
 
03:57:50.070 --> 03:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
predator um law but i i'd be lying to

04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
do you have any information on the
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
amount of registered sex offenders in

currently employed
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
so i am i've reached out to our i.t
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
department to get specifics on their
 
04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
employment and the unemployment rate i
 
04:01:24.309 --> 04:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we have about 2900
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
sex offenders within the state of new
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire not just in manchester but
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire state
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
manchester alone has about 400
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that there's about
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
27 of our offenders in manchester that
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
are homeless
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
but i can
 
04:01:39.990 --> 04:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
until i get the numbers specifically
 
04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
from our i.t department who need to pull
 
04:01:43.750 --> 04:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
that from our database the majority of
 
04:01:45.750 --> 04:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
our offenders are employed
 
04:01:48.150 --> 04:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
and are employed in various ways whether
 
04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's construction
 
04:01:49.840 --> 04:01:50.550 align:start position:0%
it's construction
to

04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:53.830 --> 04:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
um a service of other kinds of vehicle
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
service in in other areas where they may
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
come in contact with children on a
 
04:02:00.389 --> 04:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
certainly one of the areas to think
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
about is a convenience store you have
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
children walking into a convenience
 
04:02:06.080 --> 04:02:07.189 align:start position:0%
children walking into a convenience
store

04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
store
 
04:02:08.950 --> 04:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
every single day after school the same
 
04:02:10.870 --> 04:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
convenience store they're going to see
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
the same people working there so that's
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
the type of interaction you're looking
 
04:02:16.150 --> 04:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
at with this bill and we have many
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
offenders that are employed in in those
 
04:02:20.040 --> 04:02:20.050 align:start position:0%
types of situations
 
04:02:20.050 --> 04:02:25.269 align:start position:0%
types of situations
[Music]

04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative hoffer you're right ask
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
for a question yeah thank you mr chair
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
just ask the uh witness what um
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of a convenience store
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes would that mean that
 
04:02:40.469 --> 04:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
that person would be in violation of the
 
04:02:40.479 --> 04:02:44.070 align:start position:0%
that person would be in violation of the
law

04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i think one of the things to think
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
about with a bill like this it's all
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
about interpretation if someone is
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
charged and arrested then it's going to
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
be how it's interpreted through the
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
court procedure through the jury through
 
04:02:58.229 --> 04:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
the judge whoever is handling that case
 
04:03:00.229 --> 04:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
if if you say a repeat interaction and
 
04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
somebody is in in the convenience store
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
every single day
 
04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
buying a candy bar after school and that
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
person is selling them
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
a candy bar that is a repeat interaction
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
with a child now it's not involving the
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
care instruction or guidance of minor
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
children which is what the current law
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%

04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm sorry if this was
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
already covered today
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
but um can you tell me of the 2900 in
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
the state how many
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
were um convicted of crimes involving
 
04:03:42.560 --> 04:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
were um convicted of crimes involving
children

04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
because as i as i understand it it's
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
possible to be a
 
04:03:49.349 --> 04:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender for crimes that
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
do not involve children
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct we do have adult victims
 
04:03:54.640 --> 04:03:56.070 align:start position:0%
that is correct we do have adult victims
um

04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:04:04.469 --> 04:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
roughly around
 
04:04:06.389 --> 04:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of that number
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
um if i i would have to do some research
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
to get the exact numbers but it's around
 
04:04:11.199 --> 04:04:14.950 align:start position:0%
to get the exact numbers but it's around
um

04:04:14.950 --> 04:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:14.960 --> 04:04:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
around

04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.560 --> 04:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
freaky

04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
freaky
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
that's a question
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative gabriel
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair thank you for taking
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
really i was trying to determine i i
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
think that sex offenders have
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
certain levels
 
04:05:00.720 --> 04:05:01.510 align:start position:0%
certain levels
of

04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
um based on their crime i believe
 
04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct we tier offenders in new
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire so it's tier one tier two and
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
tier three
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh tier one
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
offenders are mostly misdemeanor
 
04:05:13.120 --> 04:05:14.630 align:start position:0%
offenders are mostly misdemeanor
offenses

04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh and then tier two and tier three
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
would all be felonies
 
04:05:18.319 --> 04:05:19.269 align:start position:0%
would all be felonies
um

04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:21.269 --> 04:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
with generally victims under the age of
 
04:05:21.279 --> 04:05:25.110 align:start position:0%
with generally victims under the age of
13.

04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:32.690 --> 04:05:32.700 align:start position:0%

thanks for taking my question and thank
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
you chairman
 
04:05:41.590 --> 04:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate you having that data
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
pulled up
 
04:05:42.880 --> 04:05:44.630 align:start position:0%
pulled up
um

04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:44.640 --> 04:05:45.429 align:start position:0%
um
as

04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers you just gave us
 
04:05:49.120 --> 04:05:50.389 align:start position:0%
the numbers you just gave us
uh

04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
this i just want to clarify as this was
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
written this is this was
 
04:05:57.590 --> 04:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
um determined as a housekeeping bill
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
would would any of these those people be
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
in danger of losing their jobs if this
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i can't say whether or not they'd
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
be in danger of losing their jobs again
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
it would be all interpretation if if an
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
employer can justify that the you know
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
an example that i i think of a lot is a
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
farm hand we have a lot of offenders who
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
are farm hands and within the state you
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
also have a lot of children and children
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
group child groups that go to farms to
 
04:06:30.150 --> 04:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
for school trips for birthday parties so
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not that
 
04:06:34.150 --> 04:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
employer can justify that there would be
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
no interaction with children
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
he has to determine if he's gonna
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
keep that person employed or not
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up chair for me
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
 
04:06:45.920 --> 04:06:46.870 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
question

04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
so as this bill is written now it
 
04:06:53.189 --> 04:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't clearly determine
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
the guidelines for protecting people
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
that are in rehabilitative cert like
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting their lives together
 
04:07:03.030 --> 04:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
versus people that are actually
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.429 --> 04:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
i think that it's it's open for
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you change it from what it currently
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
is it is certainly open for
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
interpretation um i think that the word
 
04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
the phrase specifically repeat
 
04:07:18.160 --> 04:07:19.349 align:start position:0%
the phrase specifically repeat
interaction

04:07:19.349 --> 04:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
if it was repeat interaction
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of direct care
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
instruction or guidance that's more
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
clear but because it separates direct
 
04:07:30.309 --> 04:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
care instruction guidance or repeat
 
04:07:30.319 --> 04:07:31.510 align:start position:0%
care instruction guidance or repeat
interaction

04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
04:07:33.110 --> 04:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
that can be interpreted many different
 
04:07:33.120 --> 04:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
that can be interpreted many different
ways

04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
ways
 
04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%

has
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
a hard enough time being able to put
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%

assault let alone a child that is just
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
probably so ungodly confused on what has
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
happened and why this happened
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%

and that bill is in regards to what i i
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
didn't understand what the
 
04:10:13.110 --> 04:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes was saying so it
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense to me because i don't
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
have the bill in front of me i have
 
04:10:18.150 --> 04:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
another chance to pull it back up but
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
what are we dealing with
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
sex offenders
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%

04:11:00.309 --> 04:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.910 --> 04:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
i think this is very serious and i want
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
to go on public record saying that
 
04:11:10.080 --> 04:11:11.349 align:start position:0%
to go on public record saying that
i

04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:11:17.110 --> 04:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i want to say that um this is
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
a very serious matter
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
this is a personal matter
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh i do take this very serious
 
04:11:38.800 --> 04:11:40.150 align:start position:0%
uh i do take this very serious
but

04:11:40.150 --> 04:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
trying to be a representative that's
 
04:11:42.319 --> 04:11:43.670 align:start position:0%
trying to be a representative that's
fair

04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
fair
 
04:11:43.680 --> 04:11:45.189 align:start position:0%
fair
and

04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:45.199 --> 04:11:46.150 align:start position:0%
and
uh

04:11:46.150 --> 04:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
also represent other people that have
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
rights especially if they paid their
 
04:11:50.880 --> 04:11:52.309 align:start position:0%
rights especially if they paid their
time

04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
and they are working without any
 
04:11:58.150 --> 04:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
problems i just don't think that this is
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
clear on the consequences that would
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
happen to their lives
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's fair
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
um i think this bill needs to be
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
retained and worked on and that's why i
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
can't support this motion not because
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
that i don't think this is a very
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
extremely important issue i do thank you
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%

04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
if they do not strike out if they do not
 
04:12:59.349 --> 04:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
return to the original rsa
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
which has these those wordings in it
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
from line
 
04:13:03.680 --> 04:13:04.469 align:start position:0%

04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
on down through 12 and then again i
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
looked it up 17 and so forth
 
04:13:12.560 --> 04:13:12.570 align:start position:0%

04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
leave them in the log which is there now
 
04:13:16.960 --> 04:13:17.670 align:start position:0%
leave them in the log which is there now
by

04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
breaking all of this out
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
i go along with what the b is i think
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
the the section two b with the public
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
and private employer et cetera et cetera
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
et cetera i like that in there
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
but if you're not if you if you're
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
crossing out all that stuff up above
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's in the law now
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
that causes me to to not vote in favor
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.830 --> 04:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
and would i be willing to make an
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.110 --> 04:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
whoever did it
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
anytime you create a list in a bill with
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
penalties you're going to leave
 
04:14:04.389 --> 04:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
something out
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
even though it does say in here
 
04:14:07.359 --> 04:14:08.020 align:start position:0%
even though it does say in here
uh

04:14:08.020 --> 04:14:08.030 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:09.590 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
kind of uh yeah it says notwithstanding
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
yeah but
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
you create you create a list you're
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
gonna leave something out
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
and i've always felt as though it's
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
better to get the the
 
04:14:22.399 --> 04:14:23.349 align:start position:0%
better to get the the
broad

04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
broad
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
brush approach
 
04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
and this is really what happens if they
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate the list and they put in
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
but that is a there was a point of order
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
on that earlier today so we're not going
 
04:14:49.429 --> 04:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
to follow that strict descent so i'll
 
04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
get called out again
 
04:14:51.680 --> 04:14:52.950 align:start position:0%
get called out again

04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
it is with fear and trepidation i will
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
speak on this because i don't have the
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
gift of gab
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
i've never kissed the blinny stone and i
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't express myself very well
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
i wish to address
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
is it on the books
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it's on the box already this whole
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
thing is already on the box
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
is it enforceable
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
i'll get back to that point
 
04:15:27.040 --> 04:15:28.149 align:start position:0%
i'll get back to that point
uh

04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
sexual assault uh number number one a
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%

a child abuse sexual sexual child abuse
 
04:15:40.149 --> 04:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
all right some words were crossed out
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
that that's already on the books
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's a class a poem we're all in
 
04:15:46.630 --> 04:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
agreement with that
 
04:15:49.110 --> 04:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
the changes
 
04:15:51.140 --> 04:15:51.150 align:start position:0%
i don't see why they're needed
 
04:15:51.150 --> 04:15:52.710 align:start position:0%
i don't see why they're needed

04:15:52.720 --> 04:15:56.229 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
part two

a person is guilty of a class b felony
if

04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
after having been convicted
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
he knowingly fails to provide that

information
 
04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
so you can add more words to that
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
from here until eternity
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%

a public a private employer shall either
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%

04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
there's something that will keep lawyers
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
employed uh for their entire lives they
 
04:16:50.790 --> 04:16:50.800 align:start position:0%

04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
verbally did he say just a horrible
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
horrible thing
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
other than the stuff that's already in
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
the books
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
we're left with
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
this meaningless statement
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
of public or private employers shall
 
04:17:06.479 --> 04:17:09.030 align:start position:0%
of public or private employers shall
verbally

04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
advise and operate
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
they shall verbally advise an applicant
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
this bill says he must have already told
 
04:17:17.439 --> 04:17:19.990 align:start position:0%
this bill says he must have already told
them

04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
about the information of his fire
 
04:17:22.399 --> 04:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
about the information of his fire
conviction

04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
04:17:26.229 --> 04:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
so the applicant must
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
tell the employer
 
04:17:30.790 --> 04:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
i was guilty of uh
 
04:17:30.800 --> 04:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
i was guilty of uh
i'm

04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
convicted of sexual offense
 
04:17:37.110 --> 04:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
and then the employer must say have you
 
04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
other than the stuff that's left on the
 
04:17:44.159 --> 04:17:46.070 align:start position:0%
other than the stuff that's left on the
books

04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
books
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
we're left with
 
04:17:48.479 --> 04:17:50.309 align:start position:0%
we're left with
nonsense

04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
nonsense
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and for that reason i
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
could not support
 
04:18:00.550 --> 04:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
this bill as as it's changing the irs
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you miss
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm actually going to support the bill
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
because i think it's more protective of
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
children i also know that we have a
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
separate rsa
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
651 which actually
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
gets into the different tiers of sexual
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
offenders so
 
04:18:28.389 --> 04:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
people who've been convicted of
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
felonious sexual assault
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
and felony level sexual assault crimes
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
are on the list
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
for life
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
people who are convicted of the
 
04:18:40.630 --> 04:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor crimes are on the list for
 
04:18:43.030 --> 04:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
i think as long as you're on that list
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
you're potentially a danger to children
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a problem with the way
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
that this law defines or with the way
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
with the way this bill um actually
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
defines the offenders i think the the
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
bigger issue may be with the other rsa
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we actually have a
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
good process to get people on and off
 
04:19:07.110 --> 04:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
that list
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
but that's a separate issue
 
04:19:15.630 --> 04:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:15.640 --> 04:19:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.349 --> 04:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
well right now i'm not sure if i support
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
it or or i don't support it um
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
but what i have taken the time to do is
 
04:19:30.800 --> 04:19:32.070 align:start position:0%
but what i have taken the time to do is
read

04:19:32.070 --> 04:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
read
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
the letter from the department of
 
04:19:33.520 --> 04:19:34.950 align:start position:0%
the letter from the department of
corrections

04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
and they were the ones that were neutral
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
but they shared the same concerns as the
 
04:19:40.640 --> 04:19:42.469 align:start position:0%
but they shared the same concerns as the
commander

04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
commander
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
of sex offenders register rebecca
 
04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the concern was
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
the open interpretation particularly
 
04:19:50.239 --> 04:19:51.110 align:start position:0%
the open interpretation particularly
around

04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
repeat the terminology repeat
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a concern to me as well when
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
i look at to read this because we keep
 
04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
in mind that yeah we send people off to
 
04:20:00.319 --> 04:20:01.429 align:start position:0%
in mind that yeah we send people off to
jail

04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
jail
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
but on the same token
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
we it's supposed to be rehabilitated
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
to come back out into the out into the
 
04:20:09.199 --> 04:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
to come back out into the out into the
world

04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
world
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and when people come back out into the
 
04:20:11.600 --> 04:20:12.469 align:start position:0%
and when people come back out into the
world

04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
world
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
whether their sex offenders whatever
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
they've done
 
04:20:14.960 --> 04:20:15.750 align:start position:0%
they've done
wrong

04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
04:20:19.990 --> 04:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
so much set up to help them to
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
restart their life
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
so when you say
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
a year from now that if someone working
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the grocery store and where kids come
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
they no longer have that position i
 
04:20:34.630 --> 04:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
would have a problem with that
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
because i look at it as um and i and i
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
suggest that you do take the time to
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
read the comments that they put in here
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
even though they were neutral the real
 
04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
concern was that
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of money to rehabilitate
 
04:20:47.359 --> 04:20:49.269 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of money to rehabilitate
people

04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
and we send them back out
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
and hopefully have them continue
 
04:20:53.680 --> 04:20:55.990 align:start position:0%
and hopefully have them continue
rehabilitation

04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation
 
04:20:58.469 --> 04:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
and um so i don't know i i'm struggling
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
with that and mainly because of the what
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
who's going to call
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
the situation a repeat
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
do they have the best judgment of it you
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
know i
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a slippery slope in my
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
opinion that we could be dealing with
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
so what i can say is looking at this the
 
04:21:24.870 --> 04:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
first thing is i
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
i understand there's some concerns that
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
people might lose their job i understand
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
these concerns
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
with how that will affect especially in
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
an economy like you're dealing with now
 
04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
especially during a pandemic
 
04:21:34.840 --> 04:21:36.550 align:start position:0%
especially during a pandemic
i

04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:21:38.710 --> 04:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
with that point take into consideration
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
04:21:40.319 --> 04:21:41.429 align:start position:0%
this bill is
designed

04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
designed
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
to protect children i think the
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative verbal and he testified
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
did a
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
excellent job explaining the psychology
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
that goes behind how this offense is
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
often committed it's not committed the
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
first second third time someone
 
04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
interacts with a child it's who's it's
 
04:21:57.199 --> 04:21:57.990 align:start position:0%
interacts with a child it's who's it's
it's

04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
planned over a longer period of time
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
what i understand that
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
child predators they actually
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
they literally
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
scope out children that are vulnerable
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of and to exploit
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
so what this says is
 
04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
they will prevent the repeat
 
04:22:19.269 --> 04:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
interactions with a mom so if you work
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
in a grocery store
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
on the loading dock in the back of the
 
04:22:22.720 --> 04:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
on the loading dock in the back of the
store

04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
store
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's not any perceivable situation
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
that i can see where that person would
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
interact with the child never mind
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
repeat interactions with the same child
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why a child would be on the
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
loading dock or girls
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
is the interaction with the child if
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
your job duties require you
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
to interact with the child
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh that's different
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
i would say like a daycare for example
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
probably not the best place to have a
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
child sex predator be working i would
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
hope there's already a lot of books
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
preventing that but
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
by listing
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
professions you've now narrowed the way
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's often interpreted by course is
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the legislative intent to narrow
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
the scope of its application
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's why you don't want to have the
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
list because if you were you're going to
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
forget something we can sit here for two
 
04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
days straight come up with all the
 
04:23:14.070 --> 04:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
places that we don't feel that a child
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
predator or child sex offender should be
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
working now i don't we put the smartest
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
people in the state all in a room we're
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
going to forget
 
04:23:22.640 --> 04:23:24.229 align:start position:0%
going to forget
so

04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
this leaving an open-ended allows
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
the discretion to include stuff in case
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
there is something
 
04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
you want to include any profession
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
period if you regularly interact with
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
the child
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
and having the employer know about that
 
04:23:39.269 --> 04:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
know about the person's history
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
that goes to liability now the employer
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
can't say i didn't know the employee
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
still wants to hire the hire the child
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
sex offender
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
or a child rapist or whatever that's
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's their
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
that now they know they can't say they
 
04:23:55.349 --> 04:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i would certainly uh
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
i believe this is a very good
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill that passed on consent last year
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
it passed out of i believe it passed on
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
the labor committee 19 to one or there's
 
04:24:09.670 --> 04:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
i understand the concerns people have
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
but i think this strengthens it doesn't
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily create new law but it's
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening and clarifying existing
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
law on a very important subject and i
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
would hope that i would be supporting
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative green
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question for you i
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
was late getting in and what was the
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
status of the state trooper
 
04:24:39.750 --> 04:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
04:24:43.110 --> 04:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think they they took a position
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
they just offered to answer questions to
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
help answer any concerns
 
04:24:47.520 --> 04:24:49.030 align:start position:0%
help answer any concerns
representative

04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
i think there's a strong argument here
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
for retaining this bill i think
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
collectively we all
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
strongly support the concept
 
04:24:59.600 --> 04:25:01.030 align:start position:0%
strongly support the concept
um

04:25:01.030 --> 04:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
there were some problems identified one
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
people losing their jobs through no
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
fault of their own
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
since they come out of prison
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
or whatever the adjudication process was
 
04:25:12.560 --> 04:25:14.389 align:start position:0%
or whatever the adjudication process was
um

04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
and then we would just
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
limit where they could work moving
 
04:25:19.110 --> 04:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
forward i've heard that potential
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
impacts with people's livelihoods
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
we also know um
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
just through the data and through the
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
statistics that
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh one's co-worker is often not a
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's more often than not family
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
or a friend of the family
 
04:25:46.149 --> 04:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
we heard that two-thirds of these
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
um crimes are committed against children
 
04:25:52.950 --> 04:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
under 13.
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
a horrible statistic there ever was
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
but under this law we would then be
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
limiting where the other served the
 
04:26:03.030 --> 04:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
people who did not commit that attack
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
can work
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
04:26:08.950 --> 04:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh well i'll say that so i guess i would
 
04:26:08.960 --> 04:26:09.990 align:start position:0%
uh well i'll say that so i guess i would
say

04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support this now i want
 
04:26:13.349 --> 04:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
to support it
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:26:23.680 --> 04:26:24.550 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
i will be supporting this bill um
 
04:26:27.760 --> 04:26:29.030 align:start position:0%
i will be supporting this bill um
i

04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it's more broad in scope
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
and doesn't list out
 
04:26:32.640 --> 04:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
and doesn't list out
um

04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
certain situations so
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's a strong bill and i think
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
that the importance here is really
 
04:26:40.479 --> 04:26:41.510 align:start position:0%
that the importance here is really
protecting

04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
i get a regular
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
update for the my city
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
and the sex offenders who happen to show
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
up in the last week or so
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i am
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
appalled at the number i see who come in
 
04:27:10.000 --> 04:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
appalled at the number i see who come in
who

04:27:11.110 --> 04:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:27:13.590 --> 04:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
in most cases have an interaction with
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
some child under the age of 13.
 
04:27:17.439 --> 04:27:20.870 align:start position:0%
some child under the age of 13.
and

04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:25.349 --> 04:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
people will tell you that they've
 
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
already served their time they've
 
04:27:27.040 --> 04:27:29.269 align:start position:0%
already served their time they've
rehabilitated

04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated
 
04:27:32.550 --> 04:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
as i understand that's not true
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill is really
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
important i think we ought to pass it
 
04:27:40.950 --> 04:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know retain it whatever people want
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's the wrong thing because
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
essentially we're saying
 
04:27:46.000 --> 04:27:46.870 align:start position:0%
essentially we're saying
uh

04:27:46.870 --> 04:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
are not near as important as the
 
04:27:56.070 --> 04:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.080 --> 04:27:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i think it's no secret
 
04:28:02.080 --> 04:28:02.870 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i think it's no secret
that

04:28:02.870 --> 04:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
i have resisted many times
 
04:28:05.279 --> 04:28:06.830 align:start position:0%
i have resisted many times
to

04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
enhance you know
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
like from
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
lower crimes up to class a mr felonies
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
and etc
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't think
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
is outreach
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
i think it protects children i think it
 
04:28:23.439 --> 04:28:24.790 align:start position:0%
i think it protects children i think it
protects

04:28:24.790 --> 04:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
protects
 
04:28:24.800 --> 04:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
protects
the

04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
child predator person
 
04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to support the bill because
 
04:28:32.469 --> 04:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
i just think that it is the right thing
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
to do for the children of new hampshire
 
04:28:41.189 --> 04:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
04:28:43.040 --> 04:28:43.830 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
uh

04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
last 29 years
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%

abusing children that they're related to

not

04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any instance where a
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
store clerk
 
04:30:50.309 --> 04:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
offended uh
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
there probably is nationwide but
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
probably pretty rare
 
04:31:02.070 --> 04:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i really
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know but i really don't like
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity and that
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
that part of the bill
 
04:31:11.110 --> 04:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
it seems like that should be uh clinched
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
i believe everyone has now spoken with
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
i also don't remember so this is the
 
04:31:29.910 --> 04:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was originally
 
04:31:33.189 --> 04:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about the paragraph that
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
required the notification by the
 
04:31:34.800 --> 04:31:35.910 align:start position:0%
required the notification by the
employer

04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
but i noticed for the other paragraphs
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
there are penalties assigned when when
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
those are violated but in that section
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
there is no penalties so if the
 
04:31:47.429 --> 04:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
they should be doing that but if they
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
inadvertently don't do that i don't
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
believe there's a penalty to the
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
employer and if it gives the defense
 
04:31:55.510 --> 04:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer something to work with then so be
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
it that i think i'm going to support
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk will now call the role if

04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
we have we've had a public hearing on i
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
was killed
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
six points
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
in my my understanding that there was a
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
desire to present an amendment
 
04:37:10.709 --> 04:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
due to our kind constraints in this
 
04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%
committee which i have
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
expressed to this uh committee members
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
several times over
 
04:37:19.590 --> 04:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
we are under time constraints uh it's
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
unlikely we would be able to get the
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
amendment in on this bill
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
being able to do the work on that it
 
04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
deserves it was requested to be retained
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
so they can at least be
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
assigned a subcommittee to work on the
 
04:37:33.029 --> 04:37:33.039 align:start position:0%
summertime i believe that that's a very
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
fair request
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
of the members of the command
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
who want to work on something
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
but as you can tell there's something
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
else we just as we're limited on what we
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
can meet on what we can do
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
so the chair will be supporting the
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
 
04:37:50.959 --> 04:37:52.230 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
chairman

04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
looking back at my notes now that i have
 
04:37:56.070 --> 04:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
a chance and i know what we're talking
 
04:37:56.080 --> 04:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
a chance and i know what we're talking
about

04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
i found some problems with this build
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
and i found the fact that
 
04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
there was some consideration there would
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
be some consideration to itl this rather
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
than retain it
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
and if we retain it at some point in the
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
future can we then ipl
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
correct we can and i will say that if if
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is not retained i would be
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
supporting an itl but speaking with
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
want to work on this issue with faith
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe that the bill itself is
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
well intended does have problems and by
 
04:38:34.629 --> 04:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
retaining it it will allow those members
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work on the very
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
after that subcommittee which will
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
probably be during the summer time into
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
the fall if we have an executive session
 
04:38:44.240 --> 04:38:45.109 align:start position:0%
the fall if we have an executive session
then

04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
i think we may probably have a different
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
looking bill by then
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%

04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
sign on to a bill i didn't think it was
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
a spy as a sponsor

and i said fine and that was about the
 
04:42:46.948 --> 04:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
last i remember
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
the last couple days i've been reading
 
04:42:48.638 --> 04:42:50.550 align:start position:0%
the last couple days i've been reading
this

04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
what this bill tries to do
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i can't support it any longer so i'm
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to remove my support from it i
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what that means as far as
 
04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
what happens to it here in the committee
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%

04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.450 --> 04:43:18.460 align:start position:0%

04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
the chief
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
experience he's unmuted mr chairman i
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if he's having technical
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
issues on this side
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
i believe he is the only witness
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
sign would you testify so we'll just
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
give it another minute too
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:52.320 --> 04:44:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:58.240 --> 04:45:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.160 --> 04:45:12.150 align:start position:0%
 
head

04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
head
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.830 --> 04:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
and he is allowed to talk uh
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah mr head
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
you are unmuted
 
04:45:23.430 --> 04:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you um thank you mr chairman
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee my
 
04:45:26.230 --> 04:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
name is richard head i'm the government
 
04:45:28.150 --> 04:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
04:45:28.160 --> 04:45:29.110 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator for the judicial
branch

04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
branch
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
um you should have received a letter
 
04:45:32.708 --> 04:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
from me last week i don't know if this
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
bill is going to go forward
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
in light of
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative testerman's testimony
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
we do ask it and this is actually an
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
issue with with bills generally
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes where it has an effective date
 
04:45:47.030 --> 04:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
upon passage
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
when bills like this are passed within
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch it requires a
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of of work on our end
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
if there are forms that get changed if
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
the uniform
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
charge table needs to be updated
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
any one bill doesn't take a substantial
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
amount of time but the cumulative total
 
04:46:10.070 --> 04:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
of bills over the course of a session
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
creates a fair amount of work in terms
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
of creating the modifications within our
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
systems within the forms
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
educating police
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement generally judges
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then also some of the technical
 
04:46:25.990 --> 04:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
changes the electronic changes that are
 
04:46:26.000 --> 04:46:27.270 align:start position:0%
changes the electronic changes that are
needed

04:46:27.270 --> 04:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
house i'm sorry rsa 14 colon 9-a
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
says that any changes to judicial
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
process actually should have an
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
effective date of january 1 2022
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
and you may see a similar testimony from
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
me throughout the session where we see a
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill that has a short
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
04:46:49.350 --> 04:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
we just ask that this bill if it is
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
going to go forward be amended to
 
04:46:54.550 --> 04:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
january 1 2022 as an effective date
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
we also just note without any position
 
04:46:59.430 --> 04:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
on it that it does have some oddities in
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
terms of structure it creates a
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor in a document that is
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
essentially a form
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
and we have not seen where where a crime
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
is actually identified and described in
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
a statute that is a form and not a
 
04:47:16.150 --> 04:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
criminal code provision
 
04:47:17.910 --> 04:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
and it also does not have a definition
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
of good behavior but again not taking a
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
position on it those are just things
 
04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
that we're noting
 
04:47:24.550 --> 04:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the bill i'm happy to take
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
any questions but
 
04:47:28.470 --> 04:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
my primary purpose was just ask for it
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr chair
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for thanking my question
 
04:47:39.600 --> 04:47:40.628 align:start position:0%
thank you for thanking my question
well

04:47:40.628 --> 04:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
i might have backed off at the last
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
second there but the title of the
 
04:47:47.430 --> 04:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bill is
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
the dependent remain in good behavior
 
04:47:51.200 --> 04:47:52.310 align:start position:0%
the dependent remain in good behavior
um

04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
you tell me what
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
so do you know what that means
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the it's actually in the context of
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
this bill i do not
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
um it is not clear from the from the
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill as to what that means typically the
 
04:48:08.788 --> 04:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
good behavior is is used
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the context of revoking something
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
so in in in fact the current form has it
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
that context in which the summons uh by
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
by receiving a summons you're
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
essentially receiving a benefit you're
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
don't having a warrant issued for your
 
04:48:23.280 --> 04:48:24.550 align:start position:0%
don't having a warrant issued for your
arrest

04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
and you have to remain of good behavior
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
um by sort of
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then you also see it in bail you
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
also see it in probation it's typically
 
04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
defined in a bail or probation order as
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
to what that means
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
um as is just sort of what are the
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
requirements of good behavior
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
in this context
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you default to some case law
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
it talks about it has to be a statutory
 
04:48:49.360 --> 04:48:50.948 align:start position:0%
it talks about it has to be a statutory
violation

04:48:50.948 --> 04:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
violation
 
04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
it becomes very unclear when you get
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
into like ordinances things like that is
 
04:48:57.510 --> 04:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
a violation of an ordinance a violation
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
of good behavior but in this case it's
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
not sort of taking away the right to a
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
summons it's not taking away bail it's
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
not taking away probation but in this
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
case the addition is creating a crime
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh so then the question is you know is
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
is somebody who might commit this crime
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
on notice of what that crime actually
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
entails by not having a definition of
 
04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
good behavior
 
04:49:20.320 --> 04:49:21.270 align:start position:0%
good behavior
oh

04:49:21.270 --> 04:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and thank
 
04:49:25.030 --> 04:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my follow-up question
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
i was pre-med not free law
 
04:49:27.840 --> 04:49:29.110 align:start position:0%
i was pre-med not free law
but

04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
is it is it basic is good behavior
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
basically say i'm expected to obey the
 
04:49:33.680 --> 04:49:34.628 align:start position:0%
basically say i'm expected to obey the
laws

04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:49:37.590 --> 04:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
because i'm a citizen all the time
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's good behavior saying
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
at least you
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
fulfill your court date as long as you
 
04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
and so in this case it's just saying
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
so at least in the current form yes
 
04:49:54.628 --> 04:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
the short answer is in very very broad
 
04:49:57.510 --> 04:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
terms i would generally agree with that
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but what becomes less clear is when
 
04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
good behavior failure to remain of good
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
behavior is itself a crime
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
as would be as would be the case in this
 
04:50:06.480 --> 04:50:08.150 align:start position:0%
as would be as would be the case in this
bill

04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
where then becomes
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not in that case in this
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
case defined where
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
normally in a in a criminal code those
 
04:50:16.830 --> 04:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
types of phrases would get
 
04:50:16.840 --> 04:50:18.628 align:start position:0%
types of phrases would get
defined

04:50:18.628 --> 04:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:50:18.638 --> 04:50:20.070 align:start position:0%
defined
convert

04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
convert
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
04:50:24.150 --> 04:50:24.160 align:start position:0%

04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
pass this um
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
you wanted the date changed to january
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
1st is that 20 22nd or 22
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
2022 correct so the the way the statute
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
reads um rsa14 colon9a
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
says that the effective date of bills
 
04:50:48.070 --> 04:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
would be that modify court process
 
04:50:51.270 --> 04:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
create new crimes which this one does
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
should become effective the january 1st
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the year after the session
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.110 --> 04:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking that question mr
 
04:51:07.120 --> 04:51:08.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking that question mr
head

04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
head
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
my question to you is simply this
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
if he goes out
 
04:51:16.550 --> 04:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
and he creates another crime
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
that in itself is a violation probably
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
of his release is that not correct
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
well this is not a release this this
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
particular form is a summons for arrest
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
so this this form is is simply uh you're
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're being issued a summons of arrest
 
04:51:36.150 --> 04:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
instead of having a warrant issued for
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
so this is this is the this is before
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
anybody has
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
gone through trial or been convicted or
 
04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
pled to anything
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
correct i misunderstood and i misstated
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
when i said that he was being released
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
my guess my question is
 
04:52:01.590 --> 04:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
if he doesn't behave himself regardless
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
of whether we have a law or not and he
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
commits a crime if we just do the
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
process don't we
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
if i understand thank you for the
 
04:52:12.390 --> 04:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
question if i understand you know if if
 
04:52:12.400 --> 04:52:13.350 align:start position:0%
question if i understand you know if if
somebody

04:52:13.350 --> 04:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
receives a summons they go up and commit
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
the crime that crime still has its own
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
penalty associated with it
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
and they can be fully charged for that
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
separate crime
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
and go through trial on that separately
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:41.680 --> 04:52:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
sir

04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:52:44.550 --> 04:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair my hand is up
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry i didn't see it
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr taking my question uh
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
could you just um educate me maybe on
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
the policy or the reference that you use
 
04:53:00.718 --> 04:53:01.510 align:start position:0%
the policy or the reference that you use
that

04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
guides us on uh
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we ought to use january first uh
 
04:53:07.440 --> 04:53:09.430 align:start position:0%
that we ought to use january first uh
2022

04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
2022
 
04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
as uh an appropriate date
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
um there's a statute um rsa 14 colon 9-a
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
and you should have you uh last friday i
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
sent a letter to the whole committee if
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
you've had a chance to to see it um
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
that statute says and i'll just read it
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
each law affecting judicial practice and
 
04:53:30.638 --> 04:53:31.750 align:start position:0%
each law affecting judicial practice and
procedure

04:53:31.750 --> 04:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
04:53:33.750 --> 04:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
or establishing or eliminating criminal
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
prohibitions civil causes of actions or
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
remedies or limitations of actions shall
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
take effect on the january 1 following
 
04:53:41.760 --> 04:53:43.670 align:start position:0%
take effect on the january 1 following
passage

04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
passage
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
and in this case this particular bill
 
04:53:47.590 --> 04:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
since it would affect judicial practice
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
and procedure
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
and create a crime being that being a
 
04:53:51.440 --> 04:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
and create a crime being that being a
misdemeanor

04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
the the bill or the i'm sorry the law
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
that governs effective date of bills
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
says that it would be effective it
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
should be effective on january 1 2022.
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly common thing we see it in
 
04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
a large number of bills um
 
04:54:08.958 --> 04:54:10.070 align:start position:0%
a large number of bills um
and

04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:12.550 --> 04:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just i try to identify it where i
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%

04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
for the committee and ask for an
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%

chief shigori i figured out my technical
 
04:54:46.160 --> 04:54:48.550 align:start position:0%
chief shigori i figured out my technical
issues

04:54:48.550 --> 04:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
issues

uh she will be next up
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
we excuse the current witness on that
 
04:55:00.070 --> 04:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:01.990 --> 04:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
04:55:02.000 --> 04:55:03.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
committee

04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:55:03.040 --> 04:55:03.830 align:start position:0%
committee
um

04:55:03.830 --> 04:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
to go a little surprised by some of the
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
things that attorney had said because
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
so 2019
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
594 594-14 someone's instead of arrest
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
was amended to add the language
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
to remain of good behavior
 
04:55:22.550 --> 04:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
a warrant of arrest may issue so
 
04:55:24.550 --> 04:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
it was already there about warrant but
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
it didn't say what the what the warrant
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
was for
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
what what what the offense would be so
 
04:55:31.270 --> 04:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that language of good behavior
 
04:55:33.510 --> 04:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
already existed in this statute
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
and it already said it was a misdemeanor
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
the next sentence is any person who
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
fails to appear in answer to such
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
summons shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
 
04:55:43.590 --> 04:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
that language already existed to say
 
04:55:45.990 --> 04:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
that a form doesn't say that is kind of
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
surprising because already existing in
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
but to go to why that i asked for this
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
bill to be filed and i thank honorable
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative testerman for doing this
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
on my behalf because i i was the one who
 
04:55:58.628 --> 04:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
asked for this
 
04:56:00.550 --> 04:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm on the interbranch
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
criminal and juvenile
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
justice council and i'll say this isn't
 
04:56:06.788 --> 04:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
something this was a discussion i had
 
04:56:08.948 --> 04:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
with judge king during one of those
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
meetings when he told me he's the head
 
04:56:13.750 --> 04:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the circuit courts who handle most
 
04:56:15.910 --> 04:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors which a summons can only be
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
issued for a violation or misdemeanor
 
04:56:20.550 --> 04:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
in lieu of an arrest
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
um that it's a it's a misdemeanor if
 
04:56:26.310 --> 04:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
they don't behave of good behavior and i
 
04:56:26.320 --> 04:56:27.270 align:start position:0%
they don't behave of good behavior and i
said

04:56:27.270 --> 04:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
i said i don't see that i see a warrant
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
can be arrested i can be warrant for
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
rest can be issued for not being a good
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
behavior but i don't see where it's a
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor because there's a period in
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
there and
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
i said if that was the intent of
 
04:56:40.798 --> 04:56:42.550 align:start position:0%
i said if that was the intent of
legislature

04:56:42.550 --> 04:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
then they should have had
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
it added that to the second sentence in
 
04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
that last little bit that has to be
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
part of the form
 
04:56:54.628 --> 04:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a long-standing law uh
 
04:56:57.270 --> 04:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
goes back to 1941 someone's instead of
 
04:56:58.390 --> 04:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
an arrest
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh but this was a a change that came in
 
04:57:00.798 --> 04:57:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh but this was a a change that came in
2019

04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
2019
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
when this bill was discussed in 2019 i
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
approached through our lobbyists i said
 
04:57:09.190 --> 04:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
we need to get that little bit clarified
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
as to what happens if they're not of
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
good behavior i mean we charged with a
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
warrant for what
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
um and it already says if you don't
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
appear which it appears in the first
 
04:57:22.868 --> 04:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
sentence that lasts a little bit
 
04:57:25.670 --> 04:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
and the second sentence says
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm sorry it says it said before
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
upon failure to appear a warrant for
 
04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
resume issue any person who fails to
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
appear and answered shall be guilty of a
 
04:57:34.160 --> 04:57:35.430 align:start position:0%
appear and answered shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor

04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
it added or to remain a good behavior
 
04:57:37.360 --> 04:57:38.470 align:start position:0%
it added or to remain a good behavior
warrant

04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
04:57:40.550 --> 04:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
may issue but it didn't say for what
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
what offense that would be
 
04:57:44.550 --> 04:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
um and i didn't hear any discussion in
 
04:57:44.560 --> 04:57:46.150 align:start position:0%
um and i didn't hear any discussion in
2019

04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
2019
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
about there was no definition of good
 
04:57:47.680 --> 04:57:48.868 align:start position:0%
about there was no definition of good
behavior

04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
04:57:51.190 --> 04:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't an issue
 
04:57:53.350 --> 04:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
apparently until now
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
i mean this this law has been in effect
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
over a year with good behavior added to
 
04:57:58.080 --> 04:57:59.030 align:start position:0%
over a year with good behavior added to
it

04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:57:59.040 --> 04:58:00.550 align:start position:0%
it
and

04:58:00.550 --> 04:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
i just wanted clarification that
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
what exactly
 
04:58:06.550 --> 04:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're charging this person with
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
because it says a warrant but it doesn't
 
04:58:09.910 --> 04:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
say what for
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
it was a minor change i'd ask for it in
 
04:58:11.760 --> 04:58:13.430 align:start position:0%
it was a minor change i'd ask for it in
2019

04:58:13.430 --> 04:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
2019
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
and from the discussion with judge king
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
that was the practice of the court or
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
the what he thought the practice of the
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
court should be anyways
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that you might needs
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
might know is unmuted so thank you
 
04:58:44.878 --> 04:58:47.910 align:start position:0%
might know is unmuted so thank you
um

04:58:47.910 --> 04:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
could you
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
do you think that a
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
change to the wording of the bill
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
as it's written
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
that references
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
the definition of good behavior
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
um as a crime in a in another rsa might
 
04:59:04.550 --> 04:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to solve the problem of
 
04:59:04.560 --> 04:59:06.788 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to solve the problem of
this

04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
two points it has to be added as i say
 
04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
that it has to be added in there as to
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
what we're arrest what the warrant's
 
04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
gonna be for and i don't have an
 
04:59:17.830 --> 04:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
objection to adding a definition of good
 
04:59:20.550 --> 04:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
behavior by case law when you look at
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
good behavior as regards to suspended
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
sentences or suspended or to revoke bail
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
it has to be a
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
crime a criminal act which is a
 
04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or higher offense or serious
 
04:59:36.628 --> 04:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle offense as stated on the
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
bail forms and the suspended forms it's
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
not spelled out it wasn't spelled out
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
when this was put in effect in 2020
 
04:59:47.350 --> 04:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
if that is what's needed i certainly
 
04:59:50.310 --> 04:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with adding that
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
04:59:53.510 --> 04:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor felony under state or
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh that's the basic that's what's on the
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
bail forms
 
05:00:00.550 --> 05:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
and or serious motor vehicle offense is
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
what's on the bail forms but it requires
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
the idea i think behind passiveness
 
05:00:11.110 --> 05:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
last year well make it effective last
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
year passed in 2019
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
was to make it so that
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
if that law enforcement more likely to
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
put people on a summons then take them
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
into custody
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and so they added good
 
05:00:26.550 --> 05:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
behavior because that was a a concern is
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have anything if we
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
release somebody on a summons to say you
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
have to be of good behavior
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
but without and it says you would arrest
 
05:00:36.390 --> 05:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
you can arrest them on a warrant but i
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what for because it's not in
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
the second sentence
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
that's why i added it but if the
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
definition of good behavior what's
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
intended that's certainly i believe
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislative body to
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
set what the legislative intent is
 
05:00:49.680 --> 05:00:50.708 align:start position:0%
set what the legislative intent is
um

05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
the courts have have defined it and and
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
through case law as committing a
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
criminal offense
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
which would eliminate violations because
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:09.510 --> 05:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question properly
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think one other thing point i'd like
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
to make is that
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
when i had this discussion with judge
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
king one of the points i made with him
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
was i'm not likely to use a summons
 
05:01:25.750 --> 05:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
unless i know
 
05:01:27.270 --> 05:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
because the intent was to give more
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
summonses out rather than arrest people
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay but i need to be assured they're
 
05:01:32.550 --> 05:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a good behavior and that i
 
05:01:32.560 --> 05:01:33.590 align:start position:0%
going to be a good behavior and that i
have

05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
some teeth to the good behavior
 
05:01:37.590 --> 05:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
that was the idea behind this is a
 
05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
warrant but what do i charge them with
 
05:01:42.550 --> 05:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
so so i said i'm unlikely to release
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
somebody to arrest somebody on a warrant
 
05:01:46.550 --> 05:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
that i don't know is going to show up
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't have anything to do if
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
they're really not of good behavior
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
because i don't know what i'd charge
 
05:01:53.190 --> 05:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
them with an offense
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
what an rsa is if somebody fails to
 
05:01:56.708 --> 05:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
appear right now if i give them a
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
summons and they fail to appear
 
05:01:59.910 --> 05:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
i can charge them with a misdemeanor
 
05:02:02.550 --> 05:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
under 594.14.
 
05:02:06.150 --> 05:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's right on the form i can do that
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
you know good behavior
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
added definition great but i think it
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be in there that that's a
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so i know what the arrest
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
warrant will be for
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify the legislative
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
intent when this was modified in 2019
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
and i understand the need to give some
 
05:02:22.798 --> 05:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
and i understand the need to give some
time

05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is a a huge ask for
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
changing law enforcement training
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not a big
 
05:02:33.670 --> 05:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
good behavior is already in there
 
05:02:36.550 --> 05:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
in a sense the the big change would be
 
05:02:38.550 --> 05:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the forums getting new new summons is
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
printed up and changing the
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
there may be a minor change that's
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
needed to the uct the uniform charge
 
05:02:47.590 --> 05:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
table i doubt it would be much though
 
05:02:47.600 --> 05:02:48.350 align:start position:0%
table i doubt it would be much though
because

05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
594.14 should already be in there
 
05:02:53.510 --> 05:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
for failing to appear so it shouldn't be
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
a huge
 
05:02:56.070 --> 05:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
change for failing to uh
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
failing to abide by a summons shouldn't
 
05:03:00.628 --> 05:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
be a a huge change because it's the same
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
sentence same rsa that should already be
 
05:03:03.520 --> 05:03:06.948 align:start position:0%
sentence same rsa that should already be
in

05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.550 --> 05:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
an intro there
 
05:03:08.560 --> 05:03:11.670 align:start position:0%
an intro there
uh

05:03:11.670 --> 05:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
interesting comment i know about it it
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies a lot for me
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
saying that thank you very much for your
 
05:03:22.958 --> 05:03:25.030 align:start position:0%
saying that thank you very much for your
testimony

05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
the challenging times you're meeting
 
05:03:28.240 --> 05:03:31.510 align:start position:0%
the challenging times you're meeting
under

05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
i see no other witnesses
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
recess i guess until the chairman comes
 
05:03:46.878 --> 05:03:49.030 align:start position:0%
recess i guess until the chairman comes
back

05:03:49.030 --> 05:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
and mr chair we had three people signing
 
05:03:54.310 --> 05:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
in to support this bill we had three
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
people signing in in opposition and we
 
05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:12.160 --> 05:12:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
now all right
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
were you on mute before yes did you guys
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%

05:12:21.750 --> 05:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
all right uh just everyone forget the
 
05:12:21.760 --> 05:12:23.430 align:start position:0%
all right uh just everyone forget the
last

05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
ten one minute sorry about that
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh people the members at home were not
 
05:12:30.550 --> 05:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh they were muted so we're just gonna
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
stop no no listen let me just start over
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
we have to start over because
 
05:12:35.600 --> 05:12:38.470 align:start position:0%
we have to start over because
please

05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:38.480 --> 05:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:12:39.430 --> 05:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
we opened the executive session on house
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill 525
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
and at that at that time we opened it
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
about maybe two minutes ago
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative burt was recognized for a
 
05:12:52.550 --> 05:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
motion of any speed to legislate
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
then that motion was seconded by
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
and at this point in time i recognized
 
05:13:01.670 --> 05:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative popper to speak uh on
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
that topic
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
i while he was speaking i realized that
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
the members from home
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
were not non-reactive to anything and
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
we've now figured that out
 
05:13:11.840 --> 05:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
we've now figured that out
so

05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:14.550 --> 05:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any objection to us
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
continuing with this process no point of
 
05:13:17.120 --> 05:13:19.110 align:start position:0%
continuing with this process no point of
view

05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
view
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
but i would like to talk at some point
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for reporting order
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
are you challenging a ruling of the
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
chair no i just have a point of order
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
after after a representative makes a
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
motion and it's seconded the motion
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
the person making the motion is usually
 
05:13:39.670 --> 05:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to his motion and
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
you did not give mr
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative burke that opportunity
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you pointing that out i uh
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
will most certainly recognize
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative if your hand was up and i
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
did not see it it wasn't off uh so my
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
that is my mistake but considering that
 
05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
his hand was not up and i didn't know
 
05:14:00.550 --> 05:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
i let him i recognized representative
 
05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
hawker whose hand was up
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm sure representative burt was
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
upset by that he would have made a point
 
05:14:10.550 --> 05:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to let representative
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
hopper re-begin his point all right and
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
i'm sure representative burt will be
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
recognized thereafter thank you uh thank
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
for the people
 
05:14:26.798 --> 05:14:28.230 align:start position:0%
for the people
online

05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
my point was that i think this bill
 
05:14:32.230 --> 05:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
should be retained
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that there is an absolute
 
05:14:37.670 --> 05:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh clear connection
 
05:14:37.680 --> 05:14:39.830 align:start position:0%
uh clear connection
between

05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh people who abuse little kids
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
and pornography
 
05:14:47.190 --> 05:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the abuse of pornography
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i think if we carefully
 
05:14:52.550 --> 05:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
write this bill we write this bill
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
we should be able to
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
write it so that when a person is
 
05:14:59.600 --> 05:15:00.788 align:start position:0%
write it so that when a person is
charged

05:15:00.788 --> 05:15:00.798 align:start position:0%
charged
 
05:15:04.310 --> 05:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and caught sexually abusing a child that
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
any electronic device that contains
 
05:15:06.798 --> 05:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
any electronic device that contains
information

05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
within the scope of that person's
 
05:15:11.120 --> 05:15:12.788 align:start position:0%
within the scope of that person's
control

05:15:12.788 --> 05:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
is subject to a warrant for
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
investigation i think in this particular
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
case i am willing to bet that they were
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
able to get that guy's
 
05:15:23.840 --> 05:15:25.510 align:start position:0%
able to get that guy's
computer

05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
computer
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure there was probably a lot
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
of information
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
other information that might have led to
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
the arrest of people that are involved
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
in child pornography also
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
because it you know
 
05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
the two behaviors go together
 
05:15:43.590 --> 05:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
so i think we should be able to craft
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
this so the police could have more
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
easily obtained a warrant in the case
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the folks that were testifying this
 
05:15:50.480 --> 05:15:52.310 align:start position:0%
of the folks that were testifying this
morning

05:15:52.310 --> 05:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:55.920 --> 05:15:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
please except my apology for recognizing
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
a different performance no need to
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman committee members the reason
 
05:16:08.240 --> 05:16:08.948 align:start position:0%
mr chairman committee members the reason
i

05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:16:11.110 --> 05:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
make the motion of itl and i just want
 
05:16:12.948 --> 05:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
to make it uh for the record i've been
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
on criminal justice uh this is i believe
 
05:16:15.520 --> 05:16:16.390 align:start position:0%
on criminal justice uh this is i believe
my

05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
fourth term my record will show that i
 
05:16:20.878 --> 05:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
fourth term my record will show that i
support

05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do to slow child
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
molesters down from abusing their
 
05:16:27.360 --> 05:16:28.628 align:start position:0%
molesters down from abusing their
children

05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
but the reason i'm
 
05:16:33.510 --> 05:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
making the motion to itl this is
 
05:16:35.350 --> 05:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
was totally against the constitution
 
05:16:41.350 --> 05:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
the second for the amendment
 
05:16:43.270 --> 05:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
was added in
 
05:16:43.280 --> 05:16:44.788 align:start position:0%
was added in
which

05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
removed you know got away from the
 
05:16:49.350 --> 05:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
but it went back to current law that we
 
05:16:53.990 --> 05:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
have now so we heard from the police
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
chief that they did request a warrant to
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
seize the computer
 
05:17:03.910 --> 05:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
sadly um cac or s-ac i'm not sure what
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
it was called where the kids got
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.030 --> 05:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
they can't draw out enough information
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
from those children
 
05:17:15.040 --> 05:17:16.550 align:start position:0%
from those children
to

05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
secure a war
 
05:17:19.040 --> 05:17:20.310 align:start position:0%
secure a war
now

05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
what i feel on this is the system
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
fails those children
 
05:17:26.638 --> 05:17:28.708 align:start position:0%
fails those children
and

05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to fix that
 
05:17:31.520 --> 05:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to fix that
um

05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
what i feel on this particular bill why
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think we should itl it is because if
 
05:17:39.910 --> 05:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
we are going to retake if we were going
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
to retain it let's just work on it over
 
05:17:43.830 --> 05:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
the summer we don't need this bill we
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
can work on anything over the summer
 
05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
bring a clean bill back because where
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
the issues are we go back to that dusty
 
05:17:52.470 --> 05:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
old piece of paper called the
 
05:17:52.480 --> 05:17:54.070 align:start position:0%
old piece of paper called the
constitution

05:17:54.070 --> 05:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that the courts are
 
05:17:59.350 --> 05:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
be okay with the language and that's
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
going to take some time
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
and um you know it's a huge hurdle to
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
work around that constitution which i
 
05:18:09.430 --> 05:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
want it to be that way
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
but again we need to itl this particular
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill and just bring a clean bill back
 
05:18:18.110 --> 05:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
next year thank you mr chairman
 
05:18:18.120 --> 05:18:22.628 align:start position:0%
next year thank you mr chairman
[Music]

05:18:22.628 --> 05:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that i'm alone when i
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
say that everybody in the room is
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
is very sorry for the unfortunate
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance that happened with the
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
family and their child and
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's just absolutely disgusting
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this bill was the
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
solution to that problem and i think
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
if it was the chief of police um that
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
testified basically even said that as
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
well that he
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
that played out which is very very
 
05:18:52.798 --> 05:18:54.070 align:start position:0%
that played out which is very very
unfortunate

05:18:54.070 --> 05:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:18:56.788 --> 05:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately their that family is the
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
one that you know felt that crap that is
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
not that's not normal and normally that
 
05:19:02.948 --> 05:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
is what happens you would take
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
any of any of that evidence and um
 
05:19:08.708 --> 05:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that this bill is
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
fixing any anything at all and everybody
 
05:19:17.110 --> 05:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.550 --> 05:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
05:19:20.708 --> 05:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
i support the ipl for house bill 545
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
because um
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
remember with a show offense to the uh
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:31.830 align:start position:0%
remember with a show offense to the uh
sponsor

05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh five
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
as it's written
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
as it's drafted
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
through nobody's fault
 
05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional and i always vote
 
05:19:50.470 --> 05:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
 
05:19:52.400 --> 05:19:53.670 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
chairman

05:19:53.670 --> 05:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:19:53.680 --> 05:19:55.350 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
no disrespect was taken from
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i would only point out that the
 
05:20:05.110 --> 05:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
has attorneys and the attorneys draw out
 
05:20:11.670 --> 05:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
our bills and they drew this up i didn't
 
05:20:13.270 --> 05:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
go in and dictate
 
05:20:16.788 --> 05:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
and i say you're correct he did up
 
05:20:22.868 --> 05:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.878 --> 05:20:26.230 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
and let me you know let me just clarify
 
05:20:29.910 --> 05:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative marston you can do an
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
excellent service by your decisions and
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
i i think they should be thankful
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
that you this is a very serious issue
 
05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
and you know working in the legal field
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
i know firsthand how difficult this
 
05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
subject is when i'm defending someone or
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
representing the victim so you get a
 
05:20:47.910 --> 05:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
great service body decision which and
 
05:20:49.110 --> 05:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
they also brought awareness in a
 
05:20:51.270 --> 05:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
situation where i think we all agree
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
the system failed that family
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and fairness to what we heard
 
05:20:57.270 --> 05:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
05:20:58.868 --> 05:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
and i appreciated that everyone in this
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
committee had respect for that family
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
and didn't ask the detailed specific
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
questions we are talking about a minor
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
so we didn't get all the information
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
so i want to thank the members for for
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh as drafted in a
 
05:21:17.910 --> 05:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislative whatever reason why they
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
draft this way we're not going to
 
05:21:21.190 --> 05:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
require a search warrant for the police
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
to come into your house and
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
take electronic device i i think that's
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
and the fourth amendment is very clear
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
that they just that's just not permitted
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment at least to fix
 
05:21:33.270 --> 05:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
the would have fixed the
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
constitutionality problem of it i know
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't adopt that amendment
 
05:21:38.788 --> 05:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh it only could be offered on a
 
05:21:40.390 --> 05:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
positive motion but just the fourth
 
05:21:41.830 --> 05:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendment the right of the people to
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
secure in their persons houses papers
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
and effects against unreasonable search
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
and seizures
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
shall not be violated in no warrants
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
shall issues but upon probable cause
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
supported by oath or affirmation
 
05:21:56.708 --> 05:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
and particularly describing the place to
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
be served and the persons of things to
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
be seized
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
under the fourth amendment going way
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
back to the fourth amendment
 
05:22:05.670 --> 05:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the police
 
05:22:08.070 --> 05:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
followed that process they applied for a
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
05:22:11.190 --> 05:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that the warrant wasn't
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
written properly
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
but under any scenario i agree with
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative parker in its statistics
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
will show this that all likelihood a sex
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
offender who physically does their sex
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
defense on a minor before they even get
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
to that level they often start with
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
child pornography and i would not be
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
surprised at all if those devices had
 
05:22:33.030 --> 05:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
child pornography on it and that's it's
 
05:22:34.708 --> 05:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
horrible and i agree that i wish the
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
police found a way
 
05:22:40.150 --> 05:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
to seize those devices and
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
look to see if this evidence because it
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
might not just be this particular victim
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
it could be others
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
but for whatever reason a judge did not
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
find probable thoughts
 
05:22:52.230 --> 05:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
i would say even retaining
 
05:22:53.590 --> 05:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
we were not rewriting the fourth
 
05:22:53.600 --> 05:22:54.948 align:start position:0%
we were not rewriting the fourth
amendment

05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
and and to me
 
05:22:58.948 --> 05:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
this is just a very unfortunate
 
05:22:58.958 --> 05:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
this is just a very unfortunate
situation

05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
but again we don't know what the
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
affidavit said we don't know what
 
05:23:08.310 --> 05:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
much more than that but all we know is
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the court did not find probable
 
05:23:09.840 --> 05:23:10.868 align:start position:0%
that the court did not find probable
cause

05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
cause
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if if that device was seized without
 
05:23:14.708 --> 05:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
the warrant
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter what's on they would be
 
05:23:16.000 --> 05:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter what's on they would be
suppressed

05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
suppressed
 
05:23:17.760 --> 05:23:20.070 align:start position:0%
suppressed
so

05:23:20.070 --> 05:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a force
 
05:23:22.708 --> 05:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
it's an unfortunate situation that
 
05:23:22.718 --> 05:23:23.910 align:start position:0%
it's an unfortunate situation that
happened

05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:23:26.230 --> 05:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
but then when we had laws on this last
 
05:23:28.150 --> 05:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
term i often said i wish we could pass
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't we'll have to give an
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
exception just for this issue but
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
because the fourth amendment is written
 
05:23:36.550 --> 05:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
so i couldn't if i could think of a way
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
to fix this i would i would be on board
 
05:23:40.470 --> 05:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
with retaining it i don't
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
i can't figure it out so that's what i'm
 
05:23:47.830 --> 05:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.190 --> 05:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:23:55.440 --> 05:23:56.708 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

05:23:56.708 --> 05:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the intent of where we're
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
trying to go with this
 
05:24:03.910 --> 05:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
and um i would
 
05:24:06.150 --> 05:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
say that we can resolve a lot of the
 
05:24:06.160 --> 05:24:07.270 align:start position:0%
say that we can resolve a lot of the
issues

05:24:07.270 --> 05:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the intent that we were trying
 
05:24:11.030 --> 05:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
to get at
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
would be with some of the other bills
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we heard
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is an extremely important issue
 
05:24:20.310 --> 05:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
this this bill was
 
05:24:22.958 --> 05:24:24.310 align:start position:0%
this this bill was
properly

05:24:24.310 --> 05:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
properly
 
05:24:24.320 --> 05:24:25.430 align:start position:0%
properly
prepared

05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
i feel that it's not appropriate
 
05:24:30.550 --> 05:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
and it does a disservice to the lawyers
 
05:24:32.550 --> 05:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
that work with us to throw them under
 
05:24:34.830 --> 05:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
the bus
 
05:24:34.840 --> 05:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
the bus
and

05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:37.830 --> 05:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
that issue was already addressed by the
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee we don't need to
 
05:24:41.190 --> 05:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
revisit them
 
05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the representative we
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
withdrew his comment after and
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
we don't even discuss it any further
 
05:24:48.600 --> 05:24:54.788 align:start position:0%
we don't even discuss it any further

05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:57.750 --> 05:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
i deserve to have a voice for my people
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
i was trying to knew you but i can't
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
until you have proven
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
but just we don't need to discuss it
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
want to say for the record please mr
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
chairman if if i can
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
that it's a completely
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh we have to hold ourselves accountable
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
to the duties of which we were elected
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
and voted into office for and it does a
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
certain disservice to our entire
 
05:25:19.680 --> 05:25:20.788 align:start position:0%
certain disservice to our entire
committee

05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:25:22.708 --> 05:25:22.718 align:start position:0%
um because i
 
05:25:24.070 --> 05:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
think we
 
05:25:26.868 --> 05:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
already answered a warning on this
 
05:25:29.850 --> 05:25:29.860 align:start position:0%
okay i'm done thank you thank you
 
05:25:29.860 --> 05:25:36.070 align:start position:0%
okay i'm done thank you thank you
[Music]

05:25:36.070 --> 05:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think this this bill is
 
05:25:39.670 --> 05:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
necessary but
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering whether or not
 
05:25:41.680 --> 05:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering whether or not
um

05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:46.550 --> 05:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
police standards are are should be
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
corrected because if we're looking at
 
05:25:52.070 --> 05:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
sex crimes
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
we probably should be looking at
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
electronic devices at the same time that
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
we are arresting them for molesting
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
children right because those two crimes
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
go together
 
05:26:04.718 --> 05:26:07.110 align:start position:0%
go together
um

05:26:07.110 --> 05:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why the sex crimes unit was
 
05:26:15.430 --> 05:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
not involved in this case that we heard
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
so do we need a new
 
05:26:20.948 --> 05:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
law or do we need to correct
 
05:26:23.670 --> 05:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
police standards
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative gabriel
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:26:34.160 --> 05:26:34.170 align:start position:0%
a good question
 
05:26:34.170 --> 05:26:36.708 align:start position:0%
a good question
[Applause]

05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
representative courtney
 
05:26:41.350 --> 05:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
but i think it was before
 
05:26:42.550 --> 05:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:26:44.470 --> 05:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative burt mentioned can you
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
speak up representative gabriel
 
05:26:47.040 --> 05:26:48.230 align:start position:0%
speak up representative gabriel
um

05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
i believe the issue might have been even
 
05:26:51.360 --> 05:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
i believe the issue might have been even
before

05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:26:52.560 --> 05:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
before
um

05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
i guess the judge
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think it happened
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
and because we we don't we're not privy
 
05:27:02.628 --> 05:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
to anything that really happened there
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
i think that whoever interviewed the
 
05:27:06.550 --> 05:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
children screwed up
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
so that has nothing to do with the law
 
05:27:11.510 --> 05:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
here that we have because it's in place
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
but for a judge to say that probable
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
cause was not there something happened
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
before that
 
05:27:19.110 --> 05:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
that made him say that
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
or her say that
 
05:27:21.200 --> 05:27:21.910 align:start position:0%
or her say that
so

05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:21.920 --> 05:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
therefore i will not be i will be
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative candelagas
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
it was stated when i asked a question
 
05:27:43.990 --> 05:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
the computer was not taken was because
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
no one said that peaches were taken
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
and we have to stand by the constitution
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we could rewrite this
 
05:27:57.600 --> 05:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we could rewrite this
bill

05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
i feel very bad but
 
05:28:05.830 --> 05:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
i always heard in other cases that they
 
05:28:07.030 --> 05:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
did have the
 
05:28:07.040 --> 05:28:07.990 align:start position:0%
did have the
um

05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
computers and whatnot to prove their
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
cases but evidently something went wrong
 
05:28:12.080 --> 05:28:14.470 align:start position:0%
cases but evidently something went wrong
here

05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:37.270 --> 05:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not a list where we'll say
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
this will establish it's not like very
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
this fact will establish this one won't
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's really it's a legal standard you
 
05:28:43.200 --> 05:28:45.030 align:start position:0%
it's really it's a legal standard you
know

05:28:45.030 --> 05:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:28:49.510 --> 05:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
more likely than not it's somewhat very
 
05:28:53.590 --> 05:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
closely done we've heard that testimony
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:58.400 --> 05:28:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:28:59.670 --> 05:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have the the exact you know
 
05:29:01.200 --> 05:29:03.110 align:start position:0%
i don't have the the exact you know
specific

05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
phrase but it has to be you know after
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
articulating the facts
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
it's basically more likely it's very
 
05:29:17.670 --> 05:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is hypothetically
 
05:29:21.190 --> 05:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
if someone would say is a known addict
 
05:29:22.708 --> 05:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
and you search that person at any given
 
05:29:22.718 --> 05:29:23.510 align:start position:0%
and you search that person at any given
time

05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:29:23.520 --> 05:29:24.470 align:start position:0%
time
right

05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:29:26.070 --> 05:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
and if you see someone who's a known
 
05:29:27.270 --> 05:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
drug addict
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
if you were to search that person at any
 
05:29:30.628 --> 05:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
given time you can make an argument that
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're highly likely to have a
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
controlled substance on
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
this but i would argue that the mere
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
fact that a person's in your addict does
 
05:29:39.190 --> 05:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
not give someone a police officer a
 
05:29:41.030 --> 05:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause you get a warrant to
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
search them or just search them every
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
time so that's the problem that you have
 
05:29:48.390 --> 05:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:50.070 --> 05:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
even though there is a link between the
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
two and you may know it just having
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
knowing you're having a hunch is
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
generally not enough
 
05:29:56.948 --> 05:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
it would have to be some fact that the
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
computer itself was involved in some
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
type of crime
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we're just basing on statistics so
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't think there will
 
05:30:03.200 --> 05:30:04.868 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't think there will
be

05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
be

05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
see see no hands raised i think the
 
05:30:12.150 --> 05:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
battery put the question on the

05:32:15.670 --> 05:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
so when a bill has a fiscal note if it's
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
itl it does not require it's still going
 
05:32:19.590 --> 05:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
to descend
 
05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
i also did check on the other bill we
 
05:32:21.200 --> 05:32:22.788 align:start position:0%
i also did check on the other bill we
had

05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
hb 945
 
05:32:27.030 --> 05:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's our hb 270 that also is still
 
05:32:29.190 --> 05:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
permitted to go to the same calendar i
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
did consult the card
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
on one of the bills i saw
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
um under 10 000 is that to cut off
 
05:32:45.600 --> 05:32:46.310 align:start position:0%
um under 10 000 is that to cut off
for

05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
the court said
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that a bill does not
 
05:32:52.628 --> 05:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
require a fiscal note
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
if it is under
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
if the fiscal impact is
 
05:33:01.030 --> 05:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
under 10 dollars so the issue when that
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
came up it involved like a piece of
 
05:33:04.708 --> 05:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
paper and
 
05:33:04.718 --> 05:33:06.310 align:start position:0%
paper and
really

05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
small marginal cost so
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
that did not require this one
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
but that just means it can't go into
 
05:33:16.628 --> 05:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it also means that the bill is
 
05:33:17.760 --> 05:33:19.430 align:start position:0%
and it also means that the bill is
required

05:33:19.430 --> 05:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
all right this time we can close the
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%

05:33:22.638 --> 05:33:25.270 align:start position:0%

i passed on the consent calendar but was
 
05:35:35.190 --> 05:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
a victim of the pandemic
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
while it's not a pressing issue
 
05:35:37.440 --> 05:35:38.628 align:start position:0%
while it's not a pressing issue
um

05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
it did seem
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
like a larger issue with the kovid 19
 
05:35:42.718 --> 05:35:45.350 align:start position:0%
like a larger issue with the kovid 19
pandemic

05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:47.270 --> 05:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
this law would be part of the harassment
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
laws which is what cyber flashing is um
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
i have received these unsolicited
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
intimate images before and is incredibly
 
05:35:55.990 --> 05:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
violating it's illegal to flash someone
 
05:35:57.430 --> 05:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
in person and i believe it should be
 
05:36:00.708 --> 05:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
illegal to do so digitally
 
05:36:03.510 --> 05:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
um regardless for the reason of sending
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
these messages
 
05:36:06.390 --> 05:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
the action of sending these images is
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
harassment with nearly no recourse for
 
05:36:10.390 --> 05:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
the people who receive them
 
05:36:12.390 --> 05:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh when i receive a message or an email
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
i expect to have a conversation not send
 
05:36:17.110 --> 05:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
graphic images with no warning
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
these images are often sent without
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
prior contact purely to get a response
 
05:36:23.110 --> 05:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
when i've received one the advice i'm
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
given is to block the sender
 
05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
indecent exposure is a similar crime
 
05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
with similar recourse that i'm asking in
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
this bill but cyber flashing can
 
05:36:31.200 --> 05:36:31.990 align:start position:0%
this bill but cyber flashing can
be

05:36:31.990 --> 05:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:36:32.000 --> 05:36:33.750 align:start position:0%
be
uh

05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
a fiber flasher can send many more
 
05:36:36.868 --> 05:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
images at a time which is why i think
 
05:36:38.708 --> 05:36:38.718 align:start position:0%
similar action and therefore similar
 
05:36:38.718 --> 05:36:39.830 align:start position:0%
similar action and therefore similar
crime

05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.110 --> 05:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative martin i just have a
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
question i do not have a copy of 296 and
 
05:37:01.830 --> 05:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
where do i go to get one here you can
 
05:37:13.030 --> 05:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
represent uh representative bourdain
 
05:37:17.910 --> 05:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:37:19.990 --> 05:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:37:20.000 --> 05:37:21.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:24.628 --> 05:37:24.638 align:start position:0%
so you said that that
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
most likely this would happen
 
05:37:28.390 --> 05:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh by phone
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
and usually
 
05:37:34.150 --> 05:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
most these kind of uh crimes might be
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
sent these images may be sent to more
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
than one person at a time
 
05:37:38.000 --> 05:37:38.868 align:start position:0%
than one person at a time
would

05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:37:40.948 --> 05:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
if that is the case would that be one
 
05:37:45.430 --> 05:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
i would assume
 
05:37:48.390 --> 05:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
multiple crimes it would have to be
 
05:37:51.670 --> 05:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
reported by the person who received them
 
05:37:53.270 --> 05:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
um so i think that by that manner it
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
would be multiple crimes but i i guess
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's not listed in the bill itself
 
05:38:01.270 --> 05:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
05:38:02.548 --> 05:38:02.558 align:start position:0%
representative boarding you recognize
 
05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question
 
05:38:06.548 --> 05:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
thank you um the reason i ask the
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
question is because um
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
under the vision there's a section
 
05:38:12.628 --> 05:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
guilty of a violation for the first
 
05:38:14.948 --> 05:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
offense and a misdemeanor for a second
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
are other offenses so uh
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
i guess it's a isn't really an important
 
05:38:21.600 --> 05:38:28.788 align:start position:0%
i guess it's a isn't really an important
question

05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
so in the original bill last term um it
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
was going to be a misdemeanor every time
 
05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
the committee changed it to a violation
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
for the first events
 
05:38:40.310 --> 05:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
um at the recommendation i believe of
 
05:38:43.510 --> 05:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
um but yes that would be something we
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
we do
 
05:38:50.070 --> 05:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
well for someone thank you
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative for testimony and if you
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't mind the chair will require a
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
question and just to clarify
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
i was opposed to that amendment last
 
05:38:59.750 --> 05:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
term of making it a
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
just a
 
05:39:02.548 --> 05:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
first offense that didn't work out so
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
well but i was going to ask you though
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
would you support an amendment that
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
changed the first offense to
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
stay either a misdemeanor or a class b
 
05:39:14.638 --> 05:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
stay either a misdemeanor or a class b
mission

05:39:15.910 --> 05:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
mission
 
05:39:15.920 --> 05:39:16.788 align:start position:0%
mission
yeah

05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:39:24.868 --> 05:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:26.788 --> 05:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:28.948 --> 05:39:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative marston thank you mr
 
05:39:30.868 --> 05:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking our
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions i have a simple question
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if
 
05:39:43.030 --> 05:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
this situation of unsolicited disclosure
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
of intimate images
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
would that constitute a probable cause
 
05:39:49.350 --> 05:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
and be allowed to confiscate the
 
05:39:49.360 --> 05:40:02.708 align:start position:0%
and be allowed to confiscate the
computer

05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:04.948 --> 05:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
that is a real relatively complicated
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
legal question but i will allow the
 
05:40:10.310 --> 05:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
witness to answer if she wishes
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
um i'm not a lawyer and
 
05:40:15.750 --> 05:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't work in criminal justice for the
 
05:40:17.510 --> 05:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
most part so i would not be able to
 
05:40:22.548 --> 05:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.558 --> 05:40:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:40:26.470 --> 05:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um there's a
 
05:40:29.350 --> 05:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
possibility i may have a follow-up but
 
05:40:29.360 --> 05:40:30.150 align:start position:0%
possibility i may have a follow-up but
the

05:40:30.150 --> 05:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:31.830 --> 05:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
first question is
 
05:40:34.470 --> 05:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming this is going to be only in
 
05:40:34.480 --> 05:40:35.830 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming this is going to be only in
state

05:40:35.830 --> 05:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:40:38.470 --> 05:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
um because it is rare but i get these
 
05:40:40.830 --> 05:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
weird friend requests on
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
facebook um
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
and occasionally it is a woman that is
 
05:40:46.080 --> 05:40:46.788 align:start position:0%
and occasionally it is a woman that is
uh

05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:49.590 --> 05:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
dressed very loosely and
 
05:40:51.750 --> 05:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not welcoming it so i delete it
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
instantly you know you know i don't have
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
a friend request and then one night and
 
05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
from what i understand everybody gets
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
them how are we gonna
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
stop that
 
05:41:00.718 --> 05:41:01.590 align:start position:0%
stop that
from

05:41:01.590 --> 05:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
um i would agree that this is a much
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
better federal law than it is a state
 
05:41:12.868 --> 05:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
law but i am only a state rep
 
05:41:12.878 --> 05:41:15.110 align:start position:0%
law but i am only a state rep
um

05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:18.390 --> 05:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
i guess it would be
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:24.070 --> 05:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
i don't really know um i would say that
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
as the victim it would be where the
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
victim is but i'm
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
not the boss on this
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
in fairness
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
that was also a very complicated legal
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
question it was back to
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we we respect the representative for
 
05:41:42.150 --> 05:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
hanging in if i could do a follow-up
 
05:41:42.160 --> 05:41:43.190 align:start position:0%
hanging in if i could do a follow-up
representative

05:41:43.190 --> 05:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:41:44.470 --> 05:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative recognized for a
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you and thank you
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question that was
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know i i just didn't know how to
 
05:41:53.590 --> 05:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
even begin to answer that last question
 
05:41:55.590 --> 05:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
what would happen if
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
if a
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
girl was sending a boy
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
some pictures that both of them enjoyed
 
05:42:05.430 --> 05:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden they broke up
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the boy says hey stop sending me
 
05:42:09.670 --> 05:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
pictures and she continued to do that
 
05:42:11.830 --> 05:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know where does it become
 
05:42:11.840 --> 05:42:13.110 align:start position:0%
you know where does it become
consensual

05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
consensual
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
so if it's unsolicited which i would say
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
is anything that wasn't specifically hey
 
05:42:24.150 --> 05:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
can you send me this um that would make
 
05:42:26.310 --> 05:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
it a crime
 
05:42:30.948 --> 05:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:30.958 --> 05:42:34.788 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you
 
05:42:38.708 --> 05:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative for taking uh my question
 
05:42:41.910 --> 05:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up if i can after
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
just for clarification there's currently
 
05:42:48.390 --> 05:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
nothing in place that would allow people
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire to report
 
05:42:53.190 --> 05:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
a crime like this and hold these
 
05:42:55.670 --> 05:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
offenders accountable is that correct
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
um there is a law that applies um if
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
you're a minor if an adult is sending a
 
05:43:02.070 --> 05:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
minor a
 
05:43:05.750 --> 05:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up
 
05:43:09.350 --> 05:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
night you're recognized for a follow-up
 
05:43:09.360 --> 05:43:10.230 align:start position:0%
night you're recognized for a follow-up
question

05:43:10.230 --> 05:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:14.470 --> 05:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
so if this were to be
 
05:43:17.350 --> 05:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
law there would be some mechanism in
 
05:43:18.868 --> 05:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
place for
 
05:43:21.270 --> 05:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
reporting getting the data of how many
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
people harassed sexually harass others
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:30.070 --> 05:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah you would file a police report
 
05:43:31.590 --> 05:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
and therefore the police would then have
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:35.040 --> 05:43:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
my question for you representative
 
05:43:47.670 --> 05:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
i i've been flashed i was on elm street
 
05:43:50.310 --> 05:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
and uh man walked by my friend and i
 
05:43:52.390 --> 05:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
were sitting outside of a cafe
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and a man walked by and um
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'm sure you can imagine what
 
05:43:58.948 --> 05:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh what else happened and then he went
 
05:44:00.948 --> 05:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
to the ben and jerry's down the street
 
05:44:00.958 --> 05:44:02.070 align:start position:0%
to the ben and jerry's down the street
again

05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:44:04.470 --> 05:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
and um it wasn't pleasant
 
05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
and i i can
 
05:44:07.590 --> 05:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
it makes 100 sense that if this is
 
05:44:09.680 --> 05:44:10.948 align:start position:0%
it makes 100 sense that if this is
happening

05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:44:13.110 --> 05:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
on the computer on the phone and text
 
05:44:14.868 --> 05:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
message that it's going to produce
 
05:44:16.470 --> 05:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
exactly the same experience the same
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
unwanted result in the recipient
 
05:44:19.440 --> 05:44:20.310 align:start position:0%
unwanted result in the recipient
um

05:44:20.310 --> 05:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
so i was curious did you file this
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislation because you had an
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
experience that led you to
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
the realization that this legislation
 
05:44:31.990 --> 05:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
was necessary or did you just observe
 
05:44:33.190 --> 05:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
that there was
 
05:44:35.190 --> 05:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
discontinuity between
 
05:44:36.310 --> 05:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
the law
 
05:44:38.230 --> 05:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
as it applies to in real life
 
05:44:39.990 --> 05:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
interactions versus online interactions
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
because i know that
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have legislation like this
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
30 years ago because of the advent of
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
the internet
 
05:44:48.708 --> 05:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
05:44:50.150 --> 05:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
before the witness answered that
 
05:44:51.750 --> 05:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
question i i didn't need to wait for a
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
moment and i
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is a i i appreciate the question it
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
is a very personal question
 
05:45:01.110 --> 05:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
so i i'll give the representative the
 
05:45:02.470 --> 05:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
discretion to answer that or not but i
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
i think you understand what the point
 
05:45:10.390 --> 05:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
um hello uh so it was part of my
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that i have received um a few
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
of these um as a state rep and then as a
 
05:45:19.510 --> 05:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
private citizen before that
 
05:45:22.948 --> 05:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
um so yes it was inspired by that i also
 
05:45:24.868 --> 05:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
had uh seen it in the news that other
 
05:45:27.270 --> 05:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
states in town um in like the city of
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
new york had also banned it
 
05:45:32.628 --> 05:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
um so it would be
 
05:45:34.390 --> 05:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
one of the first states we would be one
 
05:45:36.788 --> 05:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
of the first states to do this um
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:43.190 --> 05:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and the
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
chairman no disrespect by
 
05:45:47.270 --> 05:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know cutting off that i just want to
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
make sure you confirm
 
05:45:50.548 --> 05:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
you had i will say you've had some very
 
05:45:54.390 --> 05:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:54.400 --> 05:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
if i could just get clarification
 
05:45:59.430 --> 05:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
i believe you would the chair was asking
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
you would support an amendment that
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
would make this
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
the first offense a misdemeanor
 
05:46:07.270 --> 05:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh if said amendment was prepared would
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
would that be a would you support a
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanor
 
05:46:15.910 --> 05:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:19.270 --> 05:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
i would support either
 
05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:24.240 --> 05:46:28.708 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair and i'm not sure if the
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
sponsor also has the same recollection
 
05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
but my recollection last year was
 
05:46:37.350 --> 05:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment was made to change it to a
 
05:46:37.360 --> 05:46:39.270 align:start position:0%
the amendment was made to change it to a
violation

05:46:39.270 --> 05:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
violation
 
05:46:41.190 --> 05:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
because of concerns over some members of
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
the committee about
 
05:46:42.718 --> 05:46:44.070 align:start position:0%
the committee about
a

05:46:44.070 --> 05:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:46:46.868 --> 05:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
underage or teenage person
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
doing this because this is what stupid
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
teenagers do
 
05:46:54.310 --> 05:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and possibly having that go on uh you
 
05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
know their permanent criminal record
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
so i think that was part of the
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
rationale for changing it to a violation
 
05:47:04.708 --> 05:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
and uh and having subsequent crimes be
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors but
 
05:47:08.708 --> 05:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not 100 sure and maybe the
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
um while there was a work session on
 
05:47:19.750 --> 05:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
this bill i had my own committee to be a
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
part of okay uh so i just remembered
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
that it was at the
 
05:47:24.080 --> 05:47:25.750 align:start position:0%
that it was at the
um

05:47:25.750 --> 05:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
at the advice of the aclu to make it a
 
05:47:27.840 --> 05:47:30.070 align:start position:0%
at the advice of the aclu to make it a
violation

05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
violation
 
05:47:37.350 --> 05:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:39.350 --> 05:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
see no further questions i want to thank
 
05:47:44.070 --> 05:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:45.590 --> 05:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair is going to
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
is introducing the house bill 200 on
 
05:48:17.480 --> 05:48:17.490 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:48:18.788 --> 05:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:48:21.030 --> 05:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is increasing the penalty for
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.670 --> 05:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
a person is guilty of a class a
 
05:48:29.670 --> 05:48:29.680 align:start position:0%

05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%

05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%

05:49:05.830 --> 05:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's about all i have let me see what
 
05:49:05.840 --> 05:49:17.910 align:start position:0%
that's about all i have let me see what
else

05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:17.920 align:start position:0%

for taking my question excuse me i heard
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
from the stroke
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
as i understand this bill it's just a
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
completely up the
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
penalties involved in the situations of
 
05:49:39.990 --> 05:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
all cases
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's what it looks like to me i
 
05:49:43.990 --> 05:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
haven't personally spoken
 
05:49:44.000 --> 05:49:46.070 align:start position:0%
haven't personally spoken
right

05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
but i believe that the intent was to
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
increase the criminal penalties for
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
these violations
 
05:49:58.628 --> 05:49:58.638 align:start position:0%

05:51:05.750 --> 05:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman committee members
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
i totally oppose oh this is on hb 296.
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
i totally oppose this bill um and it was
 
05:51:15.030 --> 05:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
as it was mentioned before the thing
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:51:18.788 --> 05:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
uh if a couple is uh intimate and
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
they're sending them and then something
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
changes it becomes a very hairy issue so
 
05:51:24.470 --> 05:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's an issue right there but
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing is police are for it
 
05:51:31.750 --> 05:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
to take care of murders assaults rapes
 
05:51:34.150 --> 05:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
break-ins that's their job and we don't
 
05:51:36.868 --> 05:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
need more laws on the books this if they
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
have another law for this unsolicited
 
05:51:42.470 --> 05:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
images thing it just takes the police
 
05:51:44.070 --> 05:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
away from what they're supposed to be
 
05:51:44.080 --> 05:51:45.270 align:start position:0%
away from what they're supposed to be
doing

05:51:45.270 --> 05:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
the more important work
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
i mean this can be easily remedied you
 
05:51:51.670 --> 05:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
get a
 
05:51:53.590 --> 05:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know dirty image whatever on your
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
phone or your computer you just delete
 
05:51:58.150 --> 05:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
it and block it i mean how simple can
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
this be why do you need another law get
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
the police involved the courts don't
 
05:52:04.708 --> 05:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
they have enough to do let them work on
 
05:52:06.070 --> 05:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
the real stuff
 
05:52:09.030 --> 05:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
and let's not forget every new law then
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement and when you have
 
05:52:14.070 --> 05:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement you have police
 
05:52:15.990 --> 05:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with civilians and you know how
 
05:52:18.390 --> 05:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
that works out sometimes somebody gets
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know abrasive and then there's
 
05:52:24.310 --> 05:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
overreach and a simple little incident
 
05:52:26.390 --> 05:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
can turn into like a deadly you know
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
like you know somebody gets stopped for
 
05:52:30.548 --> 05:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
taillight not working and it becomes a
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
whole out of blown out of proportion and
 
05:52:35.510 --> 05:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
somebody dies a shooting so
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
let the police do the work for the
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
important things this is a really
 
05:52:42.390 --> 05:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
trivial issue that a person can fix it's
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
annoying it's
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
you know i agree it's tacky but you can
 
05:52:49.110 --> 05:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
just block it do you really need another
 
05:52:49.120 --> 05:52:50.390 align:start position:0%
just block it do you really need another
life

05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%

thank you chair thanks for taking my
question

05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh what's your current relationship to
 
05:53:21.270 --> 05:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:23.190 --> 05:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
are you speaking to me
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes sir oh i i'm just a private citizen
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't like getting involved with
 
05:53:29.670 --> 05:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
police and um
 
05:53:31.910 --> 05:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
the less let them do their thing and i
 
05:53:34.310 --> 05:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
think i got stopped once for as i've not
 
05:53:35.910 --> 05:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
didn't do a signal or something like
 
05:53:38.548 --> 05:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
that but i don't uh i don't mess with
 
05:53:39.910 --> 05:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
police and
 
05:53:41.430 --> 05:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
i i want to have
 
05:53:44.868 --> 05:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
as little to do with them as possible
 
05:53:48.070 --> 05:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and my follow-up
 
05:53:48.080 --> 05:53:50.708 align:start position:0%
thank you and my follow-up
oh

05:53:50.708 --> 05:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:50.718 --> 05:53:52.708 align:start position:0%
 
apologies

05:53:52.708 --> 05:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
05:53:52.718 --> 05:53:55.190 align:start position:0%
apologies
um

05:53:55.190 --> 05:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.270 --> 05:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
you think that sexual harassment is an
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
inconvenience and not a serious crime
 
05:54:04.628 --> 05:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
i think it's tacky and it's ugly and it
 
05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be done
 
05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
should it be involving the police no
 
05:54:11.030 --> 05:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely not when you can fix this
 
05:54:13.510 --> 05:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
yourself you can just block it what do
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:21.030 --> 05:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:54:24.390 --> 05:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question sir
 
05:54:27.510 --> 05:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
um i guess i got the same concerns and i
 
05:54:28.628 --> 05:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you you know could
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit more on it
 
05:54:33.270 --> 05:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
because i was concerned also if you you
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
know have a girl sending the boy picture
 
05:54:36.868 --> 05:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
and the boy sending the girl picture
 
05:54:38.310 --> 05:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
back and then all of a sudden one of
 
05:54:39.910 --> 05:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
them breaks up with them
 
05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
um you know when does it become
 
05:54:45.270 --> 05:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know against the law and and you
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
know when like you said they could just
 
05:54:49.590 --> 05:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
delete it but um you know where do you
 
05:54:51.510 --> 05:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
think that could lead to
 
05:54:55.990 --> 05:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's a big mess i mean that's becomes a
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
he shed he said and she said type a
 
05:55:03.510 --> 05:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
situation and they're both going to
 
05:55:05.510 --> 05:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
argue from their point of view
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh maybe she just doesn't want to have
 
05:55:09.910 --> 05:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
anything more to do with him and she
 
05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
period but the actual bill says that he
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
knows that she doesn't want to she
 
05:55:18.548 --> 05:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
didn't give consent so you know it's
 
05:55:19.910 --> 05:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
quite messy
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
and to make a law on this and get the
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
police involved i just think is is just
 
05:55:27.910 --> 05:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh will be an endless and not going to
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
get anybody anywhere to be honest
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
um it's that's a very messy area to get
 
05:55:36.230 --> 05:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
into especially if it was a couple that
 
05:55:37.990 --> 05:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
was intimate and they were sending
 
05:55:39.670 --> 05:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
images back and forth everybody was
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
happy with it and then the relationship
 
05:55:45.030 --> 05:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
turned sour and suddenly that very first
 
05:55:48.310 --> 05:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
text after the souring point became
 
05:55:50.470 --> 05:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's harassment and that is now
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
against the law uh how are you going to
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
find out exactly maybe he thought that

[Music]

05:59:04.708 --> 05:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:20.070 --> 05:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.590 --> 05:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:26.600 --> 05:59:30.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:59:30.310 --> 05:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:32.150 --> 05:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
i understand that and my understanding
 
05:59:34.628 --> 05:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
is and i'm glad that we have to sponsor
 
05:59:37.910 --> 05:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
him to uh correct me is that in lieu of
 
05:59:40.628 --> 05:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
being arrested
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
that police officer can issue someone's
 
05:59:42.240 --> 05:59:44.070 align:start position:0%
that police officer can issue someone's
subject

05:59:44.070 --> 05:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
subject
 
05:59:45.750 --> 05:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
so they're now released on the summons
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
and they're notified that they're gonna
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
have an arraignment on
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
so and so dates
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
in between the time that they have the
 
05:59:52.708 --> 05:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
summons and the time that they have
 
05:59:54.150 --> 05:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
their arraignment
 
05:59:55.750 --> 05:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
this summons states they must be under
 
05:59:57.510 --> 05:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
the age
 
05:59:59.430 --> 05:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's what this will i guess my
 
06:00:01.190 --> 06:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
question is what would happen if we
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
didn't pass this but someone was not on
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
good behavior in between that time here
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:11.190 --> 06:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
so they would be arrested for the new
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
crimes that's what i believe and then my
 
06:00:14.390 --> 06:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
other question is so the term good
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
behavior that's usually a condition of
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
your release
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
basically don't commit any further
 
06:00:19.760 --> 06:00:21.350 align:start position:0%
basically don't commit any further
offenses

06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
but in here we're not having a judge to
 
06:00:25.590 --> 06:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
separate the new conditions of the
 
06:00:27.670 --> 06:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
release being done by a police officer
 
06:00:27.680 --> 06:00:28.470 align:start position:0%
release being done by a police officer
which

06:00:28.470 --> 06:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:00:29.990 --> 06:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying the police officer i'm
 
06:00:30.000 --> 06:00:30.830 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying the police officer i'm
not

06:00:30.830 --> 06:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
sure it's appropriate for the police
 
06:00:35.750 --> 06:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
officers creating those conditions
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's some disrespectful please often
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
you may respond
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
may he respond without that point of
 
06:00:44.558 --> 06:00:50.230 align:start position:0%
may he respond without that point of
order

06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%

he's not to tell me what i can raise my

06:05:10.708 --> 06:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
during orientation i said
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
that it's an honor to chair this
 
06:05:14.310 --> 06:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
community having someone's experience of
 
06:05:16.390 --> 06:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative welsh has to
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
work with me as a vice chair and then
 
06:05:19.510 --> 06:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
now the dean of the house of this
 
06:05:19.520 --> 06:05:20.788 align:start position:0%

06:05:22.628 --> 06:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
and i i certainly respect the strikes in
 
06:05:24.390 --> 06:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
the tenure of perhaps
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
representatives of video along with me i
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
did not hear any
 
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:31.920 --> 06:05:33.270 align:start position:0%

06:05:38.788 --> 06:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
it works in remark but i would just if
 
06:05:40.230 --> 06:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
that comment was made i would find it
 
06:05:40.240 --> 06:05:41.830 align:start position:0%
that comment was made i would find it
inappropriate

06:05:41.830 --> 06:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
06:05:44.708 --> 06:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
and not forget any member well
 
06:05:46.788 --> 06:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
if you didn't hear it it's fine but i
 
06:05:49.110 --> 06:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
just gave my opinion
 
06:05:50.390 --> 06:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
if it was said that would be
 
06:05:50.400 --> 06:05:52.788 align:start position:0%
if it was said that would be
inappropriate

06:05:52.788 --> 06:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
06:05:54.310 --> 06:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
and we've always been able to do that
 
06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:10:29.830 --> 06:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:10:42.390 --> 06:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:44.708 --> 06:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i guess mine would be
 
06:10:47.430 --> 06:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
just a question for the chair
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
since i've been sitting on the uh
 
06:10:51.270 --> 06:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committees this is i
 
06:10:52.868 --> 06:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
guess the first time
 
06:10:55.990 --> 06:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
congrats to an amendment that uh
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
usually when we're an executive the
 
06:11:00.548 --> 06:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
amendment has to be sponsored by
 
06:11:02.708 --> 06:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
a committee member uh and i see that
 
06:11:04.548 --> 06:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
there's a representative's name before
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
representative burt's name which seems
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
kind of strange that it should only be
 
06:11:10.708 --> 06:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative first name on it am i
 
06:11:13.430 --> 06:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect or am i correct we had that
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
question came up last week last week or
 
06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
a week before i did i did actually check
 
06:11:19.430 --> 06:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
with the clerk
 
06:11:20.868 --> 06:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
and represent well just told me lunch
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
my what i
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
what i understand is this in this after
 
06:11:30.390 --> 06:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
consultation with the clerk is that
 
06:11:32.070 --> 06:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
although it's a good practice to have a
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
member of the committee be sponsored the
 
06:11:37.110 --> 06:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
amendment remember a member's name does
 
06:11:39.990 --> 06:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
not have to be on the amendment but it
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
has to only be offered
 
06:11:44.708 --> 06:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
by a member of the committee so if it
 
06:11:47.270 --> 06:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
didn't have a member's name on it of the
 
06:11:49.430 --> 06:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice public safety committee
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
that is still acceptable provided
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
there's a member going
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
or sorry willing to offer these so
 
06:11:57.670 --> 06:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not out of order for
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative bert to offer
 
06:12:07.510 --> 06:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:09.670 --> 06:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
06:12:12.470 --> 06:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes just some questions um it is a
 
06:12:14.470 --> 06:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
rather lengthy amendment and it looks
 
06:12:15.750 --> 06:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
06:12:15.760 --> 06:12:16.868 align:start position:0%
like uh
essentially

06:12:16.868 --> 06:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:12:19.030 --> 06:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
a rerun of the entire bill
 
06:12:22.150 --> 06:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
um there were several issues
 
06:12:23.510 --> 06:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
more than several issues that were
 
06:12:25.270 --> 06:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
raised during the public hearing on this
 
06:12:28.868 --> 06:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
bill we had testimony that educational
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
institutions should be exempt from this
 
06:12:30.638 --> 06:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
institutions should be exempt from this
bill

06:12:31.430 --> 06:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:12:33.430 --> 06:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
we had issues
 
06:12:35.430 --> 06:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
from the municipal association with the
 
06:12:38.150 --> 06:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
whole idea of penalizing
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
municipal officials um doing their job
 
06:12:43.750 --> 06:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
um we had a whole series of issues and
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if uh if
 
06:12:48.070 --> 06:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative burke could speak to the
 
06:12:48.080 --> 06:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
representative burke could speak to the
differences

06:12:49.350 --> 06:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
differences
 
06:12:51.830 --> 06:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the amen between the amendment uh and
 
06:12:54.868 --> 06:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:12:56.628 --> 06:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
so representative news what i can
 
06:12:59.670 --> 06:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
explain is involving the issue of
 
06:12:59.680 --> 06:13:00.708 align:start position:0%
explain is involving the issue of
uh

06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
liability involving the individual board
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
members whether it's course collections
 
06:13:06.310 --> 06:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
board members
 
06:13:08.628 --> 06:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
i assume that the the amendment does fix
 
06:13:08.638 --> 06:13:09.590 align:start position:0%
i assume that the the amendment does fix
this

06:13:09.590 --> 06:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:13:12.548 --> 06:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
please fix that one issue
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
selectmen or a school board member or
 
06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh any any public official will not be
 
06:13:22.948 --> 06:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
being liable uh for any reason merely
 
06:13:26.230 --> 06:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
the way they voted whether to support or
 
06:13:28.150 --> 06:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
object to any type of
 
06:13:30.788 --> 06:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
rule law regulation that's applicable at
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
the municipal level
 
06:13:36.788 --> 06:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
so the amendment does resolve that
 
06:13:39.990 --> 06:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's aware of where the changes
 
06:13:41.590 --> 06:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
and then in regards to the issues of
 
06:13:41.600 --> 06:13:43.110 align:start position:0%
and then in regards to the issues of
school

06:13:43.110 --> 06:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:13:44.390 --> 06:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
and this is something that this was
 
06:13:45.990 --> 06:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
actually in the first
 
06:13:48.390 --> 06:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
of the original draft
 
06:13:49.670 --> 06:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's
 
06:13:51.430 --> 06:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
still being hearing the amendment it
 
06:13:56.628 --> 06:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
what it what it does is that the schools
 
06:14:01.590 --> 06:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
our school system is not allowed to make
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
any rule they would be preempted unless
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly authorized by statute
 
06:14:08.948 --> 06:14:08.958 align:start position:0%
so when
 
06:14:10.230 --> 06:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the same level they can be an
 
06:14:12.000 --> 06:14:13.270 align:start position:0%
at the same level they can be an
authorization

06:14:13.270 --> 06:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
06:14:15.830 --> 06:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
expressly authorized for school to
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
under the current law that is irsa
 
06:14:23.430 --> 06:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
193 colon 13
 
06:14:25.750 --> 06:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
this school has the authority
 
06:14:28.628 --> 06:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
at this time to
 
06:14:30.390 --> 06:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
suspend or discipline a student if they
 
06:14:32.708 --> 06:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
were to carry a
 
06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
firearm on school property
 
06:14:36.548 --> 06:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh while the school concession they
 
06:14:38.310 --> 06:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
would actually
 
06:14:40.470 --> 06:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
the superintendent or the designee would
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
have the authority to expel this when i
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
first read this bill the biggest concern
 
06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
i had was
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
would this allow a student to
 
06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
let's say open carry on school property
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
while the school's in session
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
that seems
 
06:14:55.350 --> 06:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
to go too far and
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
it was discovered that there was a law
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
that law would protect that for me it
 
06:15:00.470 --> 06:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
06:15:01.990 --> 06:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
i would presume that most schools would
 
06:15:04.310 --> 06:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
keep that
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
rule in place
 
06:15:08.310 --> 06:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
here when you say schools are you
 
06:15:09.990 --> 06:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
talking about universities like the
 
06:15:12.868 --> 06:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
i'm reading uh
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
chapter this is under education chapter
 
06:15:18.000 --> 06:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
chapter this is under education chapter
193

06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
193
 
06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:36.070 --> 06:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
i guess this is a question to
 
06:15:37.990 --> 06:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
06:15:38.000 --> 06:15:39.270 align:start position:0%
the chair
okay

06:15:39.270 --> 06:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:39.280 --> 06:15:40.310 align:start position:0%
okay
um

06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:41.750 --> 06:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of struggling with this right
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
now because
 
06:15:43.910 --> 06:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
06:15:46.548 --> 06:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
coming through a very four
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
four and some change pages
 
06:15:50.470 --> 06:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i really would like to read this and
 
06:15:52.548 --> 06:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
i understand that representative burke
 
06:15:54.868 --> 06:15:54.878 align:start position:0%
sent it out last night but yeah
 
06:15:54.878 --> 06:16:04.310 align:start position:0%
sent it out last night but yeah
that

06:16:04.310 --> 06:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:06.470 --> 06:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can cover this on monday
 
06:16:08.948 --> 06:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
this recommendation and we just had two
 
06:16:10.548 --> 06:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
bills that we probably could just knock
 
06:16:12.630 --> 06:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
out like if that's what you wanted to do
 
06:16:12.640 --> 06:16:14.150 align:start position:0%
out like if that's what you wanted to do
[Music]

06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
i i understand the point i if i recall
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
last term we were given a 15 page bill
 
06:16:20.548 --> 06:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
it was about
 
06:16:32.330 --> 06:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:32.340 --> 06:16:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:16:36.830 --> 06:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
but with looking through the amendment
 
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
if members want to take time that we're
 
06:16:42.788 --> 06:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
still discussing it i would encourage
 
06:16:44.788 --> 06:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
people to continue
 
06:16:46.548 --> 06:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
reading through it and
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
if those are the major
 
06:16:50.310 --> 06:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
issues been changed the majority of this
 
06:16:52.708 --> 06:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
06:16:55.030 --> 06:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh i reminds you the same language as
 
06:16:55.040 --> 06:16:57.430 align:start position:0%
uh i reminds you the same language as
before

06:16:57.430 --> 06:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:16:59.670 --> 06:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
i mean you can take me through and show
 
06:17:02.548 --> 06:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
me or tell me what was changed then line
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
by line yeah
 
06:17:05.670 --> 06:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that the chair is required to
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
do that but i'm just explaining because
 
06:17:09.350 --> 06:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you go line by line that's gonna take
 
06:17:11.110 --> 06:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
without the opposition it would be
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
faster if someone actually
 
06:17:14.548 --> 06:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
independently read it
 
06:17:14.558 --> 06:17:15.510 align:start position:0%
independently read it
okay

06:17:15.510 --> 06:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
can you give this chance to leave
 
06:17:22.310 --> 06:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:26.708 --> 06:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:28.708 --> 06:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question of representative
 
06:17:28.718 --> 06:17:29.910 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question of representative
burt

06:17:29.910 --> 06:17:29.920 align:start position:0%

06:17:29.920 --> 06:17:30.708 align:start position:0%
burt
yes

06:17:30.708 --> 06:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:17:32.788 --> 06:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
and i do it during the executive session
 
06:17:35.190 --> 06:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
i do if i encourage the free club
 
06:17:35.200 --> 06:17:38.548 align:start position:0%
i do if i encourage the free club
discussion

06:17:38.548 --> 06:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
representative byrd if i understand you
 
06:17:42.230 --> 06:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
wrote the
 
06:17:45.670 --> 06:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:48.150 --> 06:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
i have no draft in this shift
 
06:17:50.150 --> 06:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
06:17:50.160 --> 06:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
follow it
yes

06:17:51.830 --> 06:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:17:54.628 --> 06:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
and somebody already somewhat stated or
 
06:17:54.638 --> 06:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
and somebody already somewhat stated or
asked

06:17:55.830 --> 06:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
asked
 
06:17:58.868 --> 06:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
this almost totally replaces the bill
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
from all the concerns we took care of
 
06:18:08.948 --> 06:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
all the concerns from the previous bill
 
06:18:11.750 --> 06:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
that was in existence and basically
 
06:18:16.150 --> 06:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:18:20.470 --> 06:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
why not just rewrite the bill an
 
06:18:21.990 --> 06:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
06:18:22.000 --> 06:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
amendment is
it

06:18:23.350 --> 06:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:18:26.948 --> 06:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
it's concluded i'm i'm confused why not
 
06:18:28.708 --> 06:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
just a build
 
06:18:30.230 --> 06:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
and state stated
 
06:18:33.350 --> 06:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
because how the legislative process
 
06:18:36.310 --> 06:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
works is i wrote well i didn't write the
 
06:18:38.628 --> 06:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
original bill uh representative silber
 
06:18:38.638 --> 06:18:39.430 align:start position:0%
original bill uh representative silber
did

06:18:39.430 --> 06:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
did
 
06:18:41.670 --> 06:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh there was a lot of concerns and the
 
06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
only way to fix house bill 307 is with
 
06:18:45.990 --> 06:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's the only way we can
 
06:18:47.750 --> 06:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
do it because we can't introduce a new
 
06:18:47.760 --> 06:18:49.430 align:start position:0%
do it because we can't introduce a new
bill

06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:18:51.270 --> 06:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to wait till next year
 
06:18:53.670 --> 06:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
so it's better to as
 
06:18:53.680 --> 06:18:55.190 align:start position:0%
so it's better to as
processed

06:18:55.190 --> 06:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
processed
 
06:18:56.868 --> 06:18:56.878 align:start position:0%

you know i have the
 
06:20:00.150 --> 06:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
if you would like to look at this
 
06:20:00.160 --> 06:20:01.590 align:start position:0%
if you would like to look at this
representative

06:20:01.590 --> 06:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:20:05.910 --> 06:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:07.910 --> 06:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
and probably the chairman but
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:20:12.628 --> 06:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
when we saw the red flag bill but we had
 
06:20:14.390 --> 06:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many
 
06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
replace all
 
06:20:18.628 --> 06:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
kinds of changes
 
06:20:21.830 --> 06:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
i specifically
 
06:20:24.628 --> 06:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
representative sponsor coming in
 
06:20:27.750 --> 06:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
and doing a replace all
 
06:20:29.830 --> 06:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
the day of the final day of your
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
executive and that we just
 
06:20:34.548 --> 06:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
it ended up just coming apart getting
 
06:20:37.590 --> 06:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
tossed out and and i question
 
06:20:40.150 --> 06:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know somebody
 
06:20:43.830 --> 06:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
all it is is the same as we had before
 
06:20:43.840 --> 06:20:45.030 align:start position:0%
all it is is the same as we had before
and

06:20:45.030 --> 06:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
but with a few changes
 
06:20:47.280 --> 06:20:48.230 align:start position:0%
but with a few changes
and

06:20:48.230 --> 06:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and so i said well who told you
 
06:20:52.628 --> 06:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
that well the sponsor told me yeah
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
and i said well i don't trust the
 
06:20:57.830 --> 06:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor now i trust
 
06:21:00.548 --> 06:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
for example i trust you but i don't
 
06:21:03.030 --> 06:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it's unreasonable
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
to say let's take a look at this over
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
the weekend and we could go down it's
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
going to pass
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't worry about that
 
06:21:12.230 --> 06:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
i think yeah
 
06:21:13.590 --> 06:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
there was anything
 
06:21:16.310 --> 06:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
you had to write answered you know
 
06:21:18.548 --> 06:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
give me a chance i mean i
 
06:21:20.868 --> 06:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
she even you know last year
 
06:21:22.390 --> 06:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
representing said well i said it to you
 
06:21:25.110 --> 06:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
at 5 30
 
06:21:26.948 --> 06:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
well i recall that was 5 30 it was it
 
06:21:28.868 --> 06:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
was the town election you know sent to
 
06:21:33.270 --> 06:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
us on a town election executive
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
i actually took the time to read the 15
 
06:21:37.030 --> 06:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
pages that were sent to me at night and
 
06:21:38.470 --> 06:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
show up the next day to have an
 
06:21:39.990 --> 06:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment there after so that was
 
06:21:41.830 --> 06:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
actually particularly frustrating
 
06:21:43.750 --> 06:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
because i read 15 pages for nothing and
 
06:21:46.470 --> 06:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
i at the time still my first year in my
 
06:21:47.830 --> 06:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
first term i used to like to reference
 
06:21:49.190 --> 06:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
the line for page numbers when you
 
06:21:49.200 --> 06:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
the line for page numbers when you
change

06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
06:21:51.510 --> 06:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
three paragraphs all my notes would
 
06:21:53.350 --> 06:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
completely help you out
 
06:21:55.110 --> 06:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i can appreciate the frustration and
 
06:21:57.910 --> 06:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know is coming back you know
 
06:21:59.910 --> 06:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
that can be frustrating so second that's
 
06:21:59.920 --> 06:22:02.070 align:start position:0%
that can be frustrating so second that's
cute

06:22:02.070 --> 06:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
cute
 
06:22:03.750 --> 06:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
i understand we had a very
 
06:22:05.910 --> 06:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
long day yesterday
 
06:22:09.110 --> 06:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
a longer day on wednesday
 
06:22:11.350 --> 06:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
so if i'm assured that the members
 
06:22:12.310 --> 06:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
at least we know everyone has the
 
06:22:15.190 --> 06:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
amendment right yes we got it
 
06:22:17.590 --> 06:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
so that that solves that problem
 
06:22:19.510 --> 06:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
no one did not have it
 
06:22:19.520 --> 06:22:20.788 align:start position:0%
no one did not have it
so

06:22:20.788 --> 06:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:22.788 --> 06:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the amendment you may
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
give me a thumbs up or something
 
06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:35.190 --> 06:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry but i didn't get to do my
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
at nine o'clock
 
06:22:43.510 --> 06:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah what what we'll do is for the time
 
06:22:44.708 --> 06:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
being rather than answer a bunch of
 
06:22:46.470 --> 06:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill that would i
 
06:22:48.390 --> 06:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
the feeling of the committee is
 
06:22:49.910 --> 06:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
that people want to have more time to
 
06:22:53.110 --> 06:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
read the amendment so why don't we
 
06:22:55.350 --> 06:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
recess this executive session
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
you can save your questions about this
 
06:22:59.270 --> 06:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
amendment until we'll get your time
 
06:23:02.070 --> 06:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll make a hint
 
06:23:09.270 --> 06:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:11.270 --> 06:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
between nine
 
06:23:13.430 --> 06:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
and four whatever whatever collie gets
 
06:23:13.440 --> 06:23:14.150 align:start position:0%
and four whatever whatever collie gets
here

06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:23:15.400 --> 06:23:15.410 align:start position:0%

i'm not taking any questions at this
 
06:24:22.310 --> 06:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
time i'm just simply asking if people i
 
06:24:24.230 --> 06:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
asked a question and i didn't get a
 
06:24:24.240 --> 06:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
asked a question and i didn't get a
response

06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:49.430 --> 06:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just simply trying to see if
 
06:24:50.868 --> 06:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
everybody has the amendment they want to
 
06:24:52.708 --> 06:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
interrupt well everyone's looking for
 
06:24:52.718 --> 06:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
interrupt well everyone's looking for
something

06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know do we want to do
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're not any following hearing to make
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
a point of order there's no ruling that
 
06:25:05.350 --> 06:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then you challenge the rule we had a
 
06:25:09.830 --> 06:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
very appropriate challenge in the
 
06:25:11.750 --> 06:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
appointment today where i
 
06:25:14.070 --> 06:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
let someone else speak and
 
06:25:28.070 --> 06:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:30.708 --> 06:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
since we are nodding and hearing do uh
 
06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
06:25:37.670 --> 06:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:40.470 --> 06:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
the only my only question is and i would
 
06:25:42.788 --> 06:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
i know what a point of order is i know
 
06:25:42.798 --> 06:25:43.510 align:start position:0%
i know what a point of order is i know
when

06:25:43.510 --> 06:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:25:46.150 --> 06:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
and i know how sensitive you are about
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
correct parliamentary language
 
06:25:51.430 --> 06:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
my question is i did not hear
 
06:25:54.470 --> 06:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
the the bill number and all i wanted was
 
06:25:56.948 --> 06:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
a clarification so if i could have that
 
06:25:59.110 --> 06:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
please that would be helpful in finding
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
the material because we don't have a
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
list of the bills to have that already

06:26:43.990 --> 06:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
no does everyone have a copy of the
 
06:26:46.948 --> 06:26:46.958 align:start position:0%

represent new me
 
06:26:51.830 --> 06:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
06:27:03.790 --> 06:27:03.800 align:start position:0%

06:27:22.390 --> 06:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
i believe it's only adding one sentence
 
06:27:24.150 --> 06:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
to the original bill
 
06:27:25.910 --> 06:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe that representative wells
 
06:27:28.070 --> 06:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
will speak on that amendment
 
06:27:28.080 --> 06:27:28.868 align:start position:0%
will speak on that amendment
but

06:27:28.868 --> 06:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:27:30.150 --> 06:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's all it's obviously the preference
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.030 --> 06:27:59.040 align:start position:0%

the the assistant sent the copies out

06:28:10.548 --> 06:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
at this time

06:28:19.350 --> 06:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
i am mr chairman i'm not trying to give
 
06:28:23.030 --> 06:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
you a hard time but it's very hard to
 
06:28:25.110 --> 06:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
hear about an amendment that you can't
 
06:28:27.590 --> 06:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
get up and just walk to the table and
 
06:28:30.230 --> 06:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
get like we used to be able to
 
06:28:34.788 --> 06:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:38.230 --> 06:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
i i agree and you're doing a good job
 
06:28:39.990 --> 06:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
i think we're doing you know overall
 
06:28:42.070 --> 06:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing our best uh and i think
 
06:28:42.080 --> 06:28:43.750 align:start position:0%
we're doing our best uh and i think
we're

06:28:43.750 --> 06:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:28:45.990 --> 06:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
all getting better this time around but
 
06:28:47.830 --> 06:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
this event is to be shorter that's the
 
06:28:52.070 --> 06:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:53.590 --> 06:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
let's open the executive center this
 
06:28:55.110 --> 06:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
time we are opening the executive

hearing
 
06:29:07.350 --> 06:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
06:29:09.110 --> 06:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
the chair is wrecking recognizing
 
06:29:22.948 --> 06:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:25.590 --> 06:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
and just just to clarify that that
 
06:29:30.948 --> 06:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:35.350 --> 06:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.750 --> 06:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak on the amendment
 
06:29:40.830 --> 06:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
yes during the hearing we had testimony
 
06:29:45.190 --> 06:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
from retired law enforcement officer
 
06:29:46.868 --> 06:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
who made the point
 
06:29:46.878 --> 06:29:47.670 align:start position:0%
who made the point
that

06:29:47.670 --> 06:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:50.390 --> 06:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
while this bill
 
06:29:52.468 --> 06:29:52.478 align:start position:0%
opens the discipline of hearings up to
 
06:29:54.390 --> 06:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
the public there are some things
 
06:29:56.468 --> 06:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be in the public for
 
06:29:56.478 --> 06:29:58.070 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be in the public for
instance

06:29:58.070 --> 06:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
instance
 
06:29:58.080 --> 06:30:01.030 align:start position:0%

uh

06:30:01.030 --> 06:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:07.270 --> 06:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:08.948 --> 06:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
the present language of the bill talks
 
06:30:10.948 --> 06:30:10.958 align:start position:0%
about the ability for an involved paddy
 
06:30:13.270 --> 06:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
presumably a police officer
 
06:30:15.190 --> 06:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
to seek closure of a portion of the
 
06:30:17.830 --> 06:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
hearing that would disclose confidential
 
06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps of solicitous information
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
related or perhaps not related to the
 
06:30:26.708 --> 06:30:26.718 align:start position:0%
allegations that we also support however
 
06:30:28.468 --> 06:30:28.478 align:start position:0%
the bill suggests that the body might
 
06:30:30.868 --> 06:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
approve the specificity
 
06:30:32.548 --> 06:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
that the portion of the hearing will
 
06:30:32.558 --> 06:30:33.510 align:start position:0%
that the portion of the hearing will
reveal

06:30:33.510 --> 06:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
reveal
 
06:30:35.510 --> 06:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
confidential information that creates a
 
06:30:43.930 --> 06:30:43.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:43.940 --> 06:30:47.430 align:start position:0%

06:30:49.270 --> 06:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
so while the bill
 
06:30:49.280 --> 06:30:50.310 align:start position:0%
so while the bill
says

06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
says
 
06:30:52.868 --> 06:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
has the one sentence added to it
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
any discipline hearing shall be
 
06:30:59.270 --> 06:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
published however
 
06:31:01.430 --> 06:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
a portion of the hearing may be close to
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
the public only if the party seeking
 
06:31:03.760 --> 06:31:05.430 align:start position:0%
the public only if the party seeking
closure

06:31:05.430 --> 06:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
closure
 
06:31:07.350 --> 06:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
the specificity
 
06:31:09.030 --> 06:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
that the portion of the hearing will
 
06:31:11.030 --> 06:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
reveal confidential information that
 
06:31:13.030 --> 06:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
creates a compelling interest
 
06:31:14.868 --> 06:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
outweighing the public's presumed right
 
06:31:16.868 --> 06:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
of access
 
06:31:18.070 --> 06:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
06:31:22.230 --> 06:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
adds to that this sentence the council
 
06:31:24.708 --> 06:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
made in a non-public session
 
06:31:26.708 --> 06:31:26.718 align:start position:0%

this amendment takes care of the

06:32:08.788 --> 06:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
it does
 
06:32:10.788 --> 06:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
that was pretty much the language that

for your expertise

um do you feel that
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
or do you have concern that this
 
06:33:05.110 --> 06:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
language could essentially make the
 
06:33:07.110 --> 06:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
entire hearing
 
06:33:07.120 --> 06:33:07.910 align:start position:0%

be

06:33:07.910 --> 06:33:07.920 align:start position:0%

somebody can make an argument to
 
06:33:11.350 --> 06:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
essentially put much or all of a
 
06:33:13.990 --> 06:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing behind closed doors
 
06:33:15.750 --> 06:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
based on the language here as opposed to
 
06:33:18.230 --> 06:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
a smaller part
 
06:33:22.310 --> 06:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:23.990 --> 06:33:24.000 align:start position:0%

doors to make certain decisions that
 
06:33:28.650 --> 06:33:28.660 align:start position:0%
they can cite that statue
 
06:33:28.660 --> 06:33:30.548 align:start position:0%
they can cite that statue

[Music]
 
06:33:32.390 --> 06:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
basically at any moment and i guess i'm
 
06:33:35.910 --> 06:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
curious is this sufficiently narrow
 
06:33:38.230 --> 06:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
i guess it would depend on
 
06:33:41.110 --> 06:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
what the hearing is about uh
 
06:33:43.430 --> 06:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
it could be any number of issues some of
 
06:33:44.708 --> 06:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
which may
 
06:33:47.670 --> 06:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
actually be entirely nonverbal
 
06:33:49.880 --> 06:33:49.890 align:start position:0%
all kinds of what's being angered
 
06:33:49.890 --> 06:33:52.868 align:start position:0%
all kinds of what's being angered

[Music]
 
06:33:54.230 --> 06:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
in representative calling i think that
 
06:33:56.070 --> 06:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
the concern was this was legitimate that
 
06:33:58.230 --> 06:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
if someone were to assert
 
06:33:58.240 --> 06:34:00.468 align:start position:0%
if someone were to assert
confidentiality

06:34:00.468 --> 06:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
06:34:02.628 --> 06:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
that's one that's one step but if it
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
were to be challenged or that the board
 
06:34:08.070 --> 06:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
did not agree that confidential
 
06:34:09.430 --> 06:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
subject or
 
06:34:10.948 --> 06:34:10.958 align:start position:0%
here it was involved confidential
 
06:34:10.958 --> 06:34:12.150 align:start position:0%
here it was involved confidential
information

06:34:12.150 --> 06:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:34:13.830 --> 06:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
in order to argue that one way or
 
06:34:13.840 --> 06:34:14.868 align:start position:0%
in order to argue that one way or
another

06:34:14.868 --> 06:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:34:16.150 --> 06:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
would be rather difficult without
 
06:34:18.468 --> 06:34:18.478 align:start position:0%
reaching the confidentiality so the idea
 
06:34:21.030 --> 06:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
is to kind of to close that hearing the
 
06:34:23.430 --> 06:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
hearing off to argue that point if it is
 
06:34:24.868 --> 06:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
confidential then the board will also
 
06:34:26.390 --> 06:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
make a decision whether the public
 
06:34:28.150 --> 06:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
interests are wasted but
 
06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would agree that there would be no
 
06:34:31.670 --> 06:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
effective way to argue that point
 
06:34:31.680 --> 06:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
effective way to argue that point
without

06:34:33.830 --> 06:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:34:36.150 --> 06:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
filing competition for example
 
06:34:38.390 --> 06:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
involving a confidential form
 
06:34:39.510 --> 06:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:34:41.190 --> 06:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
not only problematic for the officer to
 
06:34:42.708 --> 06:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
say that but disclosing that the
 
06:34:44.310 --> 06:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
identity of the conventional performance
 
06:34:47.190 --> 06:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
could put that person's
 
06:34:50.780 --> 06:34:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:50.790 --> 06:34:57.270 align:start position:0%

06:34:57.270 --> 06:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:00.708 --> 06:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
if it's obvious that they're violating
 
06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:09.190 --> 06:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
we can always
 
06:35:12.468 --> 06:35:12.478 align:start position:0%
open the area much more by
 
06:35:13.990 --> 06:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
changing the law
 
06:35:14.000 --> 06:35:15.830 align:start position:0%
changing the law
i

06:35:15.830 --> 06:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:35:17.990 --> 06:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
i know why they want to do it i mean
 
06:35:20.310 --> 06:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's not like the nashua school board
 
06:35:25.750 --> 06:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:27.830 --> 06:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's not nice in this case it's not
 
06:35:27.840 --> 06:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
that's not nice in this case it's not
nice

06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
nice
 
06:35:29.520 --> 06:35:31.190 align:start position:0%
nice

justin
 
06:35:32.948 --> 06:35:32.958 align:start position:0%
specific references
 
06:35:35.030 --> 06:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh especially
 
06:35:37.030 --> 06:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
we actually have two representatives uh
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that are from
 
06:35:38.160 --> 06:35:39.430 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that are from
nashua

06:35:39.430 --> 06:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
06:35:40.868 --> 06:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh we don't need to open that can of
 
06:35:42.708 --> 06:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
worms but that does defend the school
 
06:35:42.718 --> 06:35:44.310 align:start position:0%
worms but that does defend the school
district

06:35:44.310 --> 06:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:35:46.868 --> 06:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
and that is a school board hearing not a
 
06:35:48.868 --> 06:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
police discipline okay so even the
 
06:35:48.878 --> 06:35:51.110 align:start position:0%
police discipline okay so even the
analogy

06:35:51.110 --> 06:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
analogy
 
06:35:51.120 --> 06:35:52.310 align:start position:0%
analogy
just

06:35:52.310 --> 06:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:58.708 --> 06:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
you may continue uh that's fine i just
 
06:35:58.718 --> 06:36:02.310 align:start position:0%
you may continue uh that's fine i just
wait

06:36:02.310 --> 06:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.548 --> 06:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
if they decide to
 
06:36:06.788 --> 06:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
you know get out of hand or right you
 
06:36:08.868 --> 06:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
know they're being a little bit too
 
06:36:10.548 --> 06:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
lenient with their closing of the
 
06:36:10.558 --> 06:36:12.708 align:start position:0%
lenient with their closing of the
hearings

06:36:12.708 --> 06:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
06:36:15.670 --> 06:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
all right representative martin thank
 
06:36:18.150 --> 06:36:18.160 align:start position:0%

06:36:19.830 --> 06:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh just all of a sudden
 
06:36:19.840 --> 06:36:20.868 align:start position:0%
uh just all of a sudden
welcome

06:36:20.868 --> 06:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
06:36:20.878 --> 06:36:22.070 align:start position:0%
welcome

uh
 
06:36:25.110 --> 06:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
mike i have a question regarding
 
06:36:28.390 --> 06:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is a disciplinary hearing
 
06:36:30.788 --> 06:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if we asked it when the
 
06:36:34.310 --> 06:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:36.390 --> 06:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
discussed or brought up
 
06:36:38.788 --> 06:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
are there a lot of disciplinary hearings
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:47.270 --> 06:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
i got it
 
06:36:48.948 --> 06:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
no not hundreds
 
06:36:53.590 --> 06:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:56.788 --> 06:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
i've had two law enforcement officers uh
 
06:36:59.430 --> 06:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
be certified because of tesla that's
 
06:37:02.070 --> 06:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
different that's that was certified
 
06:37:03.590 --> 06:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
well that's a hearing yeah the
 
06:37:05.670 --> 06:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
disciplinary area which resulted in them
 
06:37:08.070 --> 06:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
being being certified
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
follow it you may follow i'm under the
 
06:37:13.350 --> 06:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
impression that a disciplinary hearing
 
06:37:15.430 --> 06:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
and a de-certifying hearing is two
 
06:37:16.868 --> 06:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
different hearings
 
06:37:18.310 --> 06:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
06:37:19.670 --> 06:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
one would run
 
06:37:24.070 --> 06:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:25.910 --> 06:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
again follow what
 
06:37:26.788 --> 06:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
you mean
 
06:37:26.798 --> 06:37:27.750 align:start position:0%
you mean
so

06:37:27.750 --> 06:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to understand here
 
06:37:30.240 --> 06:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to understand here
is

06:37:31.430 --> 06:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
if there was just a a hearing every now
 
06:37:36.708 --> 06:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
and then once in a great while
 
06:37:39.590 --> 06:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
it should be open but if all of a sudden
 
06:37:42.310 --> 06:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
the the police
 
06:37:45.190 --> 06:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
that council as you called it
 
06:37:46.628 --> 06:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
if they're hearing
 
06:37:48.948 --> 06:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings constantly all the
 
06:37:52.070 --> 06:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
time because the public at large finds
 
06:37:54.230 --> 06:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
out oh we can just
 
06:37:55.910 --> 06:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
make an accusation and it's going to
 
06:37:57.910 --> 06:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
have to be a hearing and it's going to
 
06:37:59.910 --> 06:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
have to be open and we can then they're
 
06:38:00.868 --> 06:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
going to just
 
06:38:03.750 --> 06:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
expand and expand and expand on it and
 
06:38:05.590 --> 06:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
now they're doing hundreds of these
 
06:38:07.590 --> 06:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
kinds of things wouldn't that be
 
06:38:07.600 --> 06:38:09.110 align:start position:0%
kinds of things wouldn't that be

[Music]
 
06:38:11.990 --> 06:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're gonna do hundreds they're gonna
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:21.840 --> 06:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:38:23.510 --> 06:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:38:25.590 --> 06:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:38:28.150 --> 06:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think the only reason
 
06:38:30.708 --> 06:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
or one of the main reasons
 
06:38:33.510 --> 06:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
for these hearings before that board
 
06:38:35.430 --> 06:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
is to
 
06:38:37.190 --> 06:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
really fire them
 
06:38:38.868 --> 06:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
they can't work in the state of new
 
06:38:38.878 --> 06:38:40.948 align:start position:0%
they can't work in the state of new
hampshire

06:38:40.948 --> 06:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:38:44.628 --> 06:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
other hearings are heard by their chiefs
 
06:38:45.830 --> 06:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:38:49.190 --> 06:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
board of police commissioners so i think
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're going to hurt
 
06:38:55.670 --> 06:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:55.680 --> 06:38:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:38:57.110 --> 06:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:38:59.030 --> 06:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
06:39:01.830 --> 06:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who wants to answer this
 
06:39:04.230 --> 06:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
who is going to police
 
06:39:04.240 --> 06:39:05.270 align:start position:0%
who is going to police
this

06:39:05.270 --> 06:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:39:06.628 --> 06:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
because i know
 
06:39:08.230 --> 06:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
in my town
 
06:39:10.190 --> 06:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
they hide behind
 
06:39:12.150 --> 06:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality all the time with
 
06:39:14.070 --> 06:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
personnel matters they you know they'll
 
06:39:15.830 --> 06:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
just say oh hey let's talk with just a
 
06:39:17.990 --> 06:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
ninja about personnel monitor and then
 
06:39:20.230 --> 06:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
the whole meeting is is
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
under wrap this just specifically limits
 
06:39:24.948 --> 06:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
the portion of the meeting
 
06:39:26.390 --> 06:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:39:27.990 --> 06:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
raises the issue called evangelion it
 
06:39:31.110 --> 06:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
does say that so okay they can't simply
 
06:39:32.708 --> 06:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
make the whole entire here like today if
 
06:39:34.628 --> 06:39:34.638 align:start position:0%
we're gonna discuss some confidential
 
06:39:37.110 --> 06:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
we couldn't make the whole day
 
06:39:39.590 --> 06:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have so so this if i may
 
06:39:41.750 --> 06:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman so this will
 
06:39:45.190 --> 06:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
clarify that to them that that cannot
 
06:39:45.200 --> 06:39:46.548 align:start position:0%
clarify that to them that that cannot
happen

06:39:46.548 --> 06:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:39:48.548 --> 06:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
yes it's very specific that someone has
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
to raise the issue of competition it's
 
06:39:52.788 --> 06:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
almost like his parallel raving of
 
06:39:55.430 --> 06:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
raising a privilege to make a quarrel
 
06:39:57.270 --> 06:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
you can challenge the privilege
 
06:39:58.868 --> 06:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
and say i i don't know i don't agree
 
06:40:00.390 --> 06:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
that that's the privilege
 
06:40:03.030 --> 06:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
it can then be ruled on if it's if the
 
06:40:05.510 --> 06:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
board rules that it is
 
06:40:06.708 --> 06:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
it's privilege and confidentiality
 
06:40:08.708 --> 06:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
different important rules that way it
 
06:40:10.230 --> 06:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
agrees that it's
 
06:40:11.910 --> 06:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
even if they find it as confidential
 
06:40:13.190 --> 06:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
they still have to make the
 
06:40:14.868 --> 06:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
determination that
 
06:40:16.390 --> 06:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know not disclosing the
 
06:40:18.390 --> 06:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
confidentiality outweighs the public
 
06:40:20.230 --> 06:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
interest so even if it is confidential
 
06:40:21.590 --> 06:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
if it's possible it could still be
 
06:40:21.600 --> 06:40:22.788 align:start position:0%
if it's possible it could still be
disclosed

06:40:22.788 --> 06:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
disclosed
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
but they but the argument for that is
 
06:40:27.430 --> 06:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to become okay thank you for
 
06:40:27.440 --> 06:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
going to become okay thank you for
clarifying

06:40:31.990 --> 06:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:33.910 --> 06:40:33.920 align:start position:0%

chair
 
06:40:39.030 --> 06:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
06:40:40.468 --> 06:40:40.478 align:start position:0%
maybe clarification
 
06:40:42.548 --> 06:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
from the chair
 
06:40:44.230 --> 06:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of people
 
06:40:46.390 --> 06:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
i believe have made reference to other
 
06:40:46.400 --> 06:40:49.030 align:start position:0%
i believe have made reference to other
meetings

06:40:49.030 --> 06:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:51.270 --> 06:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative welch made reference to a
 
06:40:51.280 --> 06:40:52.830 align:start position:0%
representative welch made reference to a
particular

06:40:52.830 --> 06:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:40:55.670 --> 06:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
counselor but this only deals with the
 
06:40:57.270 --> 06:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
police whatever
 
06:40:59.510 --> 06:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative wells calls it it doesn't
 
06:41:02.708 --> 06:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
refer to meetings by towns
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
no it does not
 
06:41:07.430 --> 06:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't even affect a meeting by tax
 
06:41:09.030 --> 06:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
if mr
 
06:41:10.788 --> 06:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
perhaps if somebody could say the name
 
06:41:13.110 --> 06:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the council again
 
06:41:15.830 --> 06:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
the fleet standards and training council
 
06:41:18.788 --> 06:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
and by the way the ag has a position on
 
06:41:23.430 --> 06:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:24.708 --> 06:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
i think there's two members of the
 
06:41:24.718 --> 06:41:32.390 align:start position:0%
i think there's two members of the
republicans

06:41:32.390 --> 06:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:41.190 --> 06:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:46.390 --> 06:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:54.390 --> 06:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:56.390 --> 06:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the actual testimony that
 
06:41:57.750 --> 06:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
we got from the
 
06:41:57.760 --> 06:42:01.510 align:start position:0%
we got from the
uh

06:42:01.510 --> 06:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:10.548 --> 06:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:12.468 --> 06:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire police chiefs are
 
06:42:14.708 --> 06:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
in support of public hearings on matters
 
06:42:17.430 --> 06:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
involving police conduct and allegations
 
06:42:19.910 --> 06:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
of misconduct are abusive
 
06:42:22.788 --> 06:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:23.990 --> 06:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
but it did
 
06:42:25.830 --> 06:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
06:42:29.510 --> 06:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:32.370 --> 06:42:32.380 align:start position:0%
the council me

representative marston thank you mr
chairman

06:42:46.468 --> 06:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:42:48.948 --> 06:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
i'm now starting to recall our hearing
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
on this
 
06:42:50.160 --> 06:42:51.750 align:start position:0%
on this
and

06:42:51.750 --> 06:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:54.468 --> 06:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
i remember asking a question because we
 
06:42:56.708 --> 06:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
have a young lady that wanted to testify
 
06:42:57.990 --> 06:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
and she did
 
06:43:00.868 --> 06:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
but what i'm getting at is
 
06:43:03.830 --> 06:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
this is taking the policemen in my mind
 
06:43:06.150 --> 06:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
and hanging them out
 
06:43:08.468 --> 06:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
to dry if you will the phrase that's
 
06:43:10.390 --> 06:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
been said many times and different
 
06:43:10.400 --> 06:43:10.650 align:start position:0%
been said many times and different
things

06:43:10.650 --> 06:43:10.660 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:43:10.660 --> 06:43:11.910 align:start position:0%
things
[Music]

06:43:11.910 --> 06:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:43:13.350 --> 06:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have a public
 
06:43:15.510 --> 06:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
hearing whereas
 
06:43:17.750 --> 06:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think if you're going to discipline
 
06:43:19.990 --> 06:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
one of your offices that should be done
 
06:43:21.990 --> 06:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors
 
06:43:25.910 --> 06:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's not something that should be
 
06:43:28.230 --> 06:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
splashed across the newspapers and the
 
06:43:30.548 --> 06:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
radio stations and embarrassed the
 
06:43:30.558 --> 06:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
radio stations and embarrassed the
officer

06:43:32.230 --> 06:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
officer
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
he's going to be disciplined and i don't
 
06:43:36.468 --> 06:43:36.478 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that but making it a
 
06:43:38.070 --> 06:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
06:43:40.230 --> 06:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
i find it a little intrusive and i like
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
to protect my policeman because i don't
 
06:43:43.910 --> 06:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
want that guy
 
06:43:43.920 --> 06:43:46.468 align:start position:0%
want that guy
afterwards

06:43:46.468 --> 06:43:46.478 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
06:43:49.350 --> 06:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
going off half car or maybe even
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
resigning and we need as many policemen
 
06:43:54.948 --> 06:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
as we can get with that being said
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:05.670 --> 06:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
06:44:07.510 --> 06:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
although i i appreciate the comments i
 
06:44:07.520 --> 06:44:08.390 align:start position:0%
although i i appreciate the comments i
think

06:44:08.390 --> 06:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:44:11.430 --> 06:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
what the remember votes yay or
 
06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
nay on the amendment i don't i think
 
06:44:15.670 --> 06:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is not something that's meant to
 
06:44:17.270 --> 06:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
harm police officers
 
06:44:17.280 --> 06:44:19.110 align:start position:0%
harm police officers
exactly

06:44:19.110 --> 06:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
06:44:20.948 --> 06:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
i respect police officers they have a
 
06:44:24.390 --> 06:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
very the public service they provide is
 
06:44:26.548 --> 06:44:26.558 align:start position:0%
it's an essential part of our society
 
06:44:26.558 --> 06:44:29.190 align:start position:0%
it's an essential part of our society
and

06:44:29.190 --> 06:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:30.708 --> 06:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you what
 
06:44:33.270 --> 06:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
they they are underappreciated and you
 
06:44:34.390 --> 06:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
know and that goes for a lot of first
 
06:44:34.400 --> 06:44:36.830 align:start position:0%
know and that goes for a lot of first
responders

06:44:36.830 --> 06:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
responders
 
06:44:39.750 --> 06:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh there is also a public interest on on
 
06:44:41.190 --> 06:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
the right to know
 
06:44:42.948 --> 06:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
so when these in these things
 
06:44:44.390 --> 06:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
these happen
 
06:44:46.468 --> 06:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
here there is a public interest to know
 
06:44:46.478 --> 06:44:47.430 align:start position:0%
here there is a public interest to know
what

06:44:47.430 --> 06:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:44:49.750 --> 06:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know the circumstance relate to that
 
06:44:51.590 --> 06:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
that ins especially
 
06:44:53.110 --> 06:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
if it can involve
 
06:44:54.948 --> 06:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh exculpatory evidence which is you
 
06:44:56.788 --> 06:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
know mandatory disposed in some
 
06:44:58.230 --> 06:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances there's a circumstance
 
06:44:59.750 --> 06:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
where the public has a strong interest
 
06:44:59.760 --> 06:45:00.628 align:start position:0%
where the public has a strong interest
to

06:45:00.628 --> 06:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:45:03.110 --> 06:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
have the information on
 
06:45:04.548 --> 06:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
on what
 
06:45:05.750 --> 06:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance in surrounding hearings i
 
06:45:07.430 --> 06:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's necessarily
 
06:45:09.110 --> 06:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
going against or putting our police
 
06:45:10.230 --> 06:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
office in halfway and that's why the
 
06:45:12.468 --> 06:45:12.478 align:start position:0%
confidentiality provisions
 
06:45:12.478 --> 06:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
confidentiality provisions
uh

06:45:13.430 --> 06:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:45:15.190 --> 06:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of us members felt it's important
 
06:45:18.150 --> 06:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
to address that concern before
 
06:45:19.990 --> 06:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment does trust that that was
 
06:45:21.670 --> 06:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
i believe the biggest
 
06:45:23.830 --> 06:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
primary concern that the
 
06:45:26.868 --> 06:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
um was the police association
 
06:45:28.468 --> 06:45:28.478 align:start position:0%
i think that was the primary concern
 
06:45:29.830 --> 06:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they had
 
06:45:31.350 --> 06:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
was the issue of confidentiality how
 
06:45:35.750 --> 06:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:39.430 --> 06:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:41.990 --> 06:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair thank you colleagues

06:45:54.070 --> 06:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
the experience that he brings to the
 
06:45:55.270 --> 06:45:55.280 align:start position:0%

06:46:00.830 --> 06:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
if correct me if i'm wrong
 
06:46:05.030 --> 06:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i think we're in a very tumultuous
 
06:46:05.040 --> 06:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
and i think we're in a very tumultuous
time

06:46:06.230 --> 06:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:46:08.868 --> 06:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
and part of our responsibility
 
06:46:11.030 --> 06:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
is to mend the relationships between our
 
06:46:13.750 --> 06:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
communities and our police officers
 
06:46:15.750 --> 06:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
and this gives us a choice to start
 
06:46:18.708 --> 06:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
doing that because people
 
06:46:20.948 --> 06:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
want to know that
 
06:46:23.030 --> 06:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
the police are being held accountable
 
06:46:26.548 --> 06:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
and there's no transparency that of of
 
06:46:28.468 --> 06:46:28.478 align:start position:0%
that right now um
 
06:46:28.478 --> 06:46:29.270 align:start position:0%
that right now um
so

06:46:29.270 --> 06:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:46:31.030 --> 06:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
with that i think this protects the
 
06:46:34.548 --> 06:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
police officers and highlights
 
06:46:37.350 --> 06:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
um you know separates
 
06:46:40.230 --> 06:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
a potential bad one from
 
06:46:42.788 --> 06:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
naming all of them bad and
 
06:46:44.708 --> 06:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
damaging the trust of communities i
 
06:46:47.350 --> 06:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
think this is a a much needed bill that
 
06:46:48.788 --> 06:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
can repair
 
06:46:51.430 --> 06:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
our relationships with the police thank
 
06:46:51.440 --> 06:46:55.830 align:start position:0%
our relationships with the police thank
you

06:46:55.830 --> 06:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:57.270 --> 06:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative rose
 
06:47:00.708 --> 06:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i
 
06:47:02.868 --> 06:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative klein knight
 
06:47:04.708 --> 06:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
06:47:07.510 --> 06:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
if you're going into a hearing it isn't
 
06:47:09.990 --> 06:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
because you didn't do anything wrong
 
06:47:11.750 --> 06:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
06:47:13.590 --> 06:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate but i also think that
 
06:47:18.070 --> 06:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:20.390 --> 06:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
their perception is that
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of times officers feel like
 
06:47:24.868 --> 06:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
they're above the law
 
06:47:27.670 --> 06:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily my opinion that's
 
06:47:29.430 --> 06:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
just what i hear to be the opinion of
 
06:47:35.350 --> 06:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:37.030 --> 06:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is a good thing
 
06:47:38.628 --> 06:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
actually and you you're still going to
 
06:47:40.390 --> 06:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
protect me if there's a
 
06:47:42.468 --> 06:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
victim specifically that doesn't want
 
06:47:44.310 --> 06:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
their name to be said or you know that
 
06:47:45.670 --> 06:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's all going to be kept secret as
 
06:47:47.670 --> 06:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
well you're not bringing that person
 
06:47:50.230 --> 06:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
into the light you're just bringing the
 
06:47:50.240 --> 06:48:03.830 align:start position:0%
into the light you're just bringing the
charges

06:48:03.830 --> 06:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:07.510 --> 06:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to clarify that
 
06:48:09.590 --> 06:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to hurt any police
 
06:48:12.868 --> 06:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
officers either but i was told that it
 
06:48:15.350 --> 06:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
was when they went before
 
06:48:17.910 --> 06:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
the police standing and training
 
06:48:20.788 --> 06:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
for disciplinary and that has to be very
 
06:48:24.230 --> 06:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
bad to be sent up there so i believe in
 
06:48:29.270 --> 06:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:31.670 --> 06:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative jaffrey what i just want
 
06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
06:48:35.350 --> 06:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
the only thing that changed in this
 
06:48:38.548 --> 06:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
amendment is the very last sentence
 
06:48:44.548 --> 06:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
which is a good thing
 
06:48:48.070 --> 06:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
well i i told i probably should be much
 
06:48:51.990 --> 06:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:53.830 --> 06:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
all right seeing a note known for the
 
06:48:55.910 --> 06:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
hands raised uh the matter where we put
 
06:48:57.590 --> 06:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
the question the corporate poll involved
 
06:48:59.990 --> 06:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is the question to be considered
 
06:49:02.820 --> 06:49:02.830 align:start position:0%
is whether to adopt amendment number
 
06:49:02.830 --> 06:49:06.948 align:start position:0%

07:20:59.430 --> 07:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:12.150 --> 07:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:12.160 --> 07:21:14.230 align:start position:0%

07:21:27.990 --> 07:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
and if i may speak for that motion
 
07:21:29.350 --> 07:21:29.360 align:start position:0%

motion of the police thank you uh
 
07:21:33.990 --> 07:21:34.000 align:start position:0%

07:21:36.070 --> 07:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
he lives in somerset's district
 
07:21:37.910 --> 07:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
part of dover i know him well
 
07:21:37.920 --> 07:21:39.190 align:start position:0%
part of dover i know him well
um

07:21:39.190 --> 07:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:40.868 --> 07:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
is it they've been disposed this week i
 
07:21:41.990 --> 07:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
know he would have liked to have been
 
07:21:43.990 --> 07:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
here to explain more about what his bill
 
07:21:45.670 --> 07:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
was about she had approached me to
 
07:21:48.468 --> 07:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this bill a while back
 
07:21:50.468 --> 07:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
and it really was intended to put more
 
07:21:52.708 --> 07:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
strength and more behind sort of
 
07:21:56.830 --> 07:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
egregious invasions of privacy involving
 
07:21:59.270 --> 07:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
um exactly where it sounds like cameras
 
07:22:01.270 --> 07:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
placed in places
 
07:22:03.190 --> 07:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
um i would have liked to have known more
 
07:22:04.310 --> 07:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
about this
 
07:22:07.190 --> 07:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh i did not have that opportunity
 
07:22:07.200 --> 07:22:08.468 align:start position:0%
uh i did not have that opportunity
um

07:22:08.468 --> 07:22:08.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:13.030 --> 07:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think igl best course
 
07:22:16.788 --> 07:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you i i will i will say that
 
07:22:18.548 --> 07:22:18.558 align:start position:0%
and i had to say he's on here this bill
 
07:22:20.070 --> 07:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be straightforward it
 
07:22:20.080 --> 07:22:21.350 align:start position:0%
is going to be straightforward it
involves

07:22:21.350 --> 07:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
involves
 
07:22:21.360 --> 07:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
involves
uh

07:22:22.070 --> 07:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:22:22.080 --> 07:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh
really

07:22:23.990 --> 07:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
07:22:26.788 --> 07:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
disposing intimate images that were one
 
07:22:28.468 --> 07:22:28.478 align:start position:0%
they did
 
07:22:30.150 --> 07:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
the image was our video was captured
 
07:22:33.190 --> 07:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
without the person's consent
 
07:22:34.708 --> 07:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
and then it was publicized it does
 
07:22:36.230 --> 07:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
create a
 
07:22:37.990 --> 07:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
exception if you have a wildlife camera
 
07:22:40.230 --> 07:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
on i suppose that's outside and if a
 
07:22:42.230 --> 07:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
person's neuter engaging in the sexual
 
07:22:43.750 --> 07:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
life outside
 
07:22:45.510 --> 07:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
is not really as much of an expectation
 
07:22:45.520 --> 07:22:47.110 align:start position:0%
is not really as much of an expectation
privacy

07:22:47.110 --> 07:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
07:22:48.548 --> 07:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
as much as it would be inside your home
 
07:22:51.590 --> 07:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
or decent side of the building
 
07:22:51.600 --> 07:22:52.708 align:start position:0%
or decent side of the building
but

07:22:52.708 --> 07:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:22:54.788 --> 07:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
what happens is that people
 
07:22:57.430 --> 07:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
nowadays are there's cameras everywhere
 
07:22:59.350 --> 07:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
and people make recordings i mean people
 
07:23:01.110 --> 07:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
take screenshots
 
07:23:02.548 --> 07:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of inappropriate things
 
07:23:04.948 --> 07:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
that can be done with a camera without
 
07:23:07.350 --> 07:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
someone's knowledge or consent
 
07:23:09.030 --> 07:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
and if that were to be done and then it
 
07:23:11.190 --> 07:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
was to be shared
 
07:23:13.270 --> 07:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
i will say that just
 
07:23:14.868 --> 07:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
once it's out there in cyberspace it's
 
07:23:16.548 --> 07:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
probably never going away i mean i hate
 
07:23:18.468 --> 07:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
to don't naming any names when it
 
07:23:20.310 --> 07:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
happens to celebrities unfortunately
 
07:23:21.590 --> 07:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
more than
 
07:23:22.548 --> 07:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
you know that's when it gets a lot of
 
07:23:24.310 --> 07:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
news but once it's out there it's out
 
07:23:26.868 --> 07:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
there forever it's not going away
 
07:23:29.350 --> 07:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's a permanent person we're 20
 
07:23:30.390 --> 07:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
years old when it happens and when
 
07:23:32.548 --> 07:23:32.558 align:start position:0%
they're 50 that new photo will still be
 
07:23:32.558 --> 07:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
they're 50 that new photo will still be
up

07:23:33.510 --> 07:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:23:35.670 --> 07:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
so what this will do
 
07:23:37.750 --> 07:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
what this will do is sim
 
07:23:37.760 --> 07:23:38.788 align:start position:0%
what this will do is sim
represent

07:23:38.788 --> 07:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
represent
 
07:23:40.548 --> 07:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
you're on the phone while we're in
 
07:23:43.510 --> 07:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:45.990 --> 07:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:48.390 --> 07:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
what this would do is
 
07:23:50.628 --> 07:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
simply this would increase the penalty
 
07:23:52.628 --> 07:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh i think for the
 
07:23:54.070 --> 07:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
right now the first it's a it's a
 
07:23:56.070 --> 07:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but what would happen for a
 
07:23:57.910 --> 07:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense it would be a classy
 
07:23:57.920 --> 07:23:59.270 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense it would be a classy
film

07:23:59.270 --> 07:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
film
 
07:24:01.110 --> 07:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
as wrong as this act is the first time i
 
07:24:02.948 --> 07:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
think it's worse to do
 
07:24:04.948 --> 07:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
07:24:10.230 --> 07:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:12.150 --> 07:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's just my my thought
 
07:24:12.160 --> 07:24:13.750 align:start position:0%
that's just my my thought
but

07:24:13.750 --> 07:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:24:18.380 --> 07:24:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:18.390 --> 07:24:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:24:21.030 --> 07:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:24:25.030 --> 07:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean so i i respect that um
 
07:24:25.040 --> 07:24:26.230 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean so i i respect that um
and

07:24:26.230 --> 07:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:24:28.070 --> 07:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
you may have brought me along i mean i
 
07:24:29.990 --> 07:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
would have liked to learn more about it
 
07:24:31.510 --> 07:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
the concept is
 
07:24:31.520 --> 07:24:32.390 align:start position:0%
the concept is
um

07:24:32.390 --> 07:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:24:33.990 --> 07:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
your description
 
07:24:34.000 --> 07:24:35.030 align:start position:0%
your description
um

07:24:35.030 --> 07:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:24:35.910 --> 07:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:24:38.070 --> 07:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
clear some things out um
 
07:24:38.080 --> 07:24:40.548 align:start position:0%
clear some things out um
so

07:24:40.548 --> 07:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:41.670 --> 07:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
it seems like you're gonna take the
 
07:24:43.350 --> 07:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
effort and if the will of the committee
 
07:24:43.360 --> 07:24:44.230 align:start position:0%
effort and if the will of the committee
uh

07:24:44.230 --> 07:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:24:45.990 --> 07:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
make another motion i'm happy to pull my
 
07:24:48.628 --> 07:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
back and to try another approach
 
07:24:50.628 --> 07:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
we've had several motions withdrawn in
 
07:24:52.788 --> 07:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
this committee you're free to
 
07:24:55.110 --> 07:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
withdraw your emotion uh mr chairman i'd
 
07:24:58.628 --> 07:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:00.708 --> 07:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
to make it consistent
 
07:25:02.310 --> 07:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
with would there be a second to allow
 
07:25:03.670 --> 07:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative colony to withdraw that
 
07:25:03.680 --> 07:25:06.310 align:start position:0%
representative colony to withdraw that
motion

07:25:06.310 --> 07:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:12.310 --> 07:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:21.110 --> 07:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:23.910 --> 07:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes i have a problem when we try to
 
07:25:26.868 --> 07:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
increase penalties i really do
 
07:25:28.948 --> 07:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
so that was my problem that i had with
 
07:25:30.948 --> 07:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
this but unfortunately i wasn't able to
 
07:25:33.190 --> 07:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
talk to the prime sponsor
 
07:25:36.788 --> 07:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
so i cannot vote for this in good faith
 
07:25:39.830 --> 07:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
with penalties increasing
 
07:25:42.628 --> 07:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
so what we need to do is right now just
 
07:25:44.628 --> 07:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the
 
07:25:46.628 --> 07:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
the comment there's been a motion now
 
07:25:48.468 --> 07:25:48.478 align:start position:0%
about the past
 
07:25:50.150 --> 07:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
the question now is will some of the
 
07:26:01.330 --> 07:26:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:01.340 --> 07:26:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:26:09.030 --> 07:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:11.910 --> 07:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
when enhancing penalties is a concern
 
07:26:14.548 --> 07:26:14.558 align:start position:0%
and i understand that there's different
 
07:26:16.468 --> 07:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
movements enhance some penalties or
 
07:26:18.070 --> 07:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
reduce others
 
07:26:19.190 --> 07:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
what i
 
07:26:20.390 --> 07:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
i understand we all have different
 
07:26:20.400 --> 07:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
i understand we all have different
opinions

07:26:22.070 --> 07:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
07:26:25.350 --> 07:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
this really enhances the second offense
 
07:26:27.430 --> 07:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
more than the first so the first offense
 
07:26:29.510 --> 07:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
will not be
 
07:26:31.830 --> 07:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh it let me correct that roman numeral
 
07:26:31.840 --> 07:26:33.430 align:start position:0%
uh it let me correct that roman numeral
three

07:26:33.430 --> 07:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
07:26:35.750 --> 07:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh at the very bottom the person is
 
07:26:37.670 --> 07:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
guilty of a class a misdemeanor the
 
07:26:39.670 --> 07:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
first offense and a class b selling for
 
07:26:41.510 --> 07:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
the second assumption offense
 
07:26:43.350 --> 07:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
the way that is written just says when
 
07:26:45.830 --> 07:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
it says just misdemeanor they haven't
 
07:26:47.750 --> 07:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is just maybe a learning point too
 
07:26:51.190 --> 07:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
and i was taught this by the chairman
 
07:26:53.830 --> 07:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
if you ever read an rsa and it just says
 
07:26:53.840 --> 07:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
if you ever read an rsa and it just says
misdemeanor

07:26:55.190 --> 07:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
07:26:58.310 --> 07:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:00.388 --> 07:27:00.398 align:start position:0%
that means it's like an older law what
 
07:27:02.150 --> 07:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
that does is that the
 
07:27:03.830 --> 07:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor or the district attorney
 
07:27:06.868 --> 07:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
has the discretion then charge that as
 
07:27:08.628 --> 07:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
an aorta
 
07:27:10.628 --> 07:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
most laws written now
 
07:27:10.638 --> 07:27:11.750 align:start position:0%
most laws written now
today

07:27:11.750 --> 07:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:27:15.350 --> 07:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
will specify a or b what they wish
 
07:27:15.360 --> 07:27:16.230 align:start position:0%
will specify a or b what they wish
so

07:27:16.230 --> 07:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:27:17.910 --> 07:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the differences with the class b
 
07:27:20.708 --> 07:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor there's no uh
 
07:27:23.910 --> 07:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's no chance of any jail time
 
07:27:25.670 --> 07:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
so when you look at
 
07:27:27.430 --> 07:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
roman numeral three whereas a person is
 
07:27:28.628 --> 07:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
guilty of a
 
07:27:30.230 --> 07:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
now specialized class a missing from
 
07:27:32.468 --> 07:27:32.478 align:start position:0%
breast offense before that was within
 
07:27:34.468 --> 07:27:34.478 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the prospect
 
07:27:36.548 --> 07:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
by the excuse the district return
 
07:27:36.558 --> 07:27:37.270 align:start position:0%
by the excuse the district return
to

07:27:37.270 --> 07:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:27:39.270 --> 07:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
of how to charge them
 
07:27:42.948 --> 07:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
that this will eliminate that
 
07:27:44.468 --> 07:27:44.478 align:start position:0%
and then
 
07:27:45.990 --> 07:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's then a class b for the second or
 
07:27:47.350 --> 07:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense it doesn't keep
 
07:27:49.190 --> 07:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
elevating them eventually
 
07:27:51.510 --> 07:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
a felony
 
07:27:51.520 --> 07:27:52.230 align:start position:0%
a felony
so

07:27:52.230 --> 07:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:27:53.510 --> 07:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
when i say that it doesn't enhance any
 
07:27:55.030 --> 07:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
penalties for the first offense that's
 
07:27:56.948 --> 07:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
not entirely accurate
 
07:27:58.070 --> 07:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't eliminate that
 
07:27:58.080 --> 07:28:00.388 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't eliminate that
discretion

07:28:00.388 --> 07:28:00.398 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
07:28:02.150 --> 07:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is a lot of these
 
07:28:03.190 --> 07:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
things are
 
07:28:05.030 --> 07:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
registered or occurred you only charge
 
07:28:06.388 --> 07:28:06.398 align:start position:0%
the class a
 
07:28:06.398 --> 07:28:07.670 align:start position:0%
the class a
just

07:28:07.670 --> 07:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:28:09.430 --> 07:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's just from what i eat what i hear
 
07:28:11.510 --> 07:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
07:28:11.520 --> 07:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
in the community
so

07:28:13.830 --> 07:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:20.388 --> 07:28:20.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:23.830 --> 07:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:25.590 --> 07:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
07:28:27.110 --> 07:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is actually a bill that we heard
 
07:28:31.750 --> 07:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
last year it was uh hb uh 1175
 
07:28:34.310 --> 07:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
and uh we passed it in committee 19 to
 
07:28:36.948 --> 07:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
nothing after we decided to amend it
 
07:28:38.628 --> 07:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
and last year
 
07:28:40.868 --> 07:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
our debate mostly focused on the fact
 
07:28:43.110 --> 07:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
that originally what the bill did was it
 
07:28:45.590 --> 07:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
made even the first offense a class b
 
07:28:45.600 --> 07:28:47.030 align:start position:0%
made even the first offense a class b
penalty

07:28:47.030 --> 07:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
07:28:48.948 --> 07:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
and so i have a note that representative
 
07:28:52.230 --> 07:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
welch had submitted an amendment
 
07:28:55.270 --> 07:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
that reduced that to a misdemeanor
 
07:28:57.190 --> 07:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
07:28:58.868 --> 07:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
sort of where we are and just kind of
 
07:29:01.110 --> 07:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
looking through the bill um it seems to
 
07:29:01.120 --> 07:29:02.230 align:start position:0%
looking through the bill um it seems to
be

07:29:02.230 --> 07:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:29:04.788 --> 07:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
what we passed last year uh 19 to
 
07:29:04.798 --> 07:29:06.310 align:start position:0%
what we passed last year uh 19 to
nothing

07:29:06.310 --> 07:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
07:29:08.230 --> 07:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we have sometimes
 
07:29:10.070 --> 07:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
when you have bills that kind of go over
 
07:29:12.948 --> 07:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
multiple sessions is um you know you
 
07:29:14.948 --> 07:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
have notes and longer memories of the
 
07:29:16.948 --> 07:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
the testimony and
 
07:29:19.110 --> 07:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that stuck with me in
 
07:29:21.750 --> 07:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony for 1175 last year was
 
07:29:22.868 --> 07:29:22.878 align:start position:0%
that we had a
 
07:29:25.750 --> 07:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
a sitting state representative who came
 
07:29:27.670 --> 07:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
and testified
 
07:29:29.910 --> 07:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
in a really
 
07:29:32.230 --> 07:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a heart-rending way
 
07:29:33.830 --> 07:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
and described how this had happened to
 
07:29:33.840 --> 07:29:34.788 align:start position:0%
and described how this had happened to
her

07:29:34.788 --> 07:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
her
 
07:29:36.868 --> 07:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
and she had been in a situation you know
 
07:29:39.350 --> 07:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
where time after time after time
 
07:29:41.750 --> 07:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
somebody that that she trusted
 
07:29:44.468 --> 07:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
used a hidden camera to take pictures of
 
07:29:46.788 --> 07:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
her uh video of her that he put out on
 
07:29:48.230 --> 07:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
the internet
 
07:29:48.240 --> 07:29:49.350 align:start position:0%
the internet
um

07:29:49.350 --> 07:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:51.830 --> 07:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
and uh to sit there and listen to that
 
07:29:55.030 --> 07:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
story was just heartbreaking and i know
 
07:29:57.510 --> 07:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear that testimony uh this
 
07:29:58.948 --> 07:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
year and
 
07:30:00.948 --> 07:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
we hear so many bills and sometimes a
 
07:30:03.270 --> 07:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
testimony in individual bills can be
 
07:30:04.788 --> 07:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
really hard to
 
07:30:08.150 --> 07:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
to remember but this particular one did
 
07:30:09.510 --> 07:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
stick with me
 
07:30:11.830 --> 07:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
07:30:13.590 --> 07:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
this is another one of the bills that
 
07:30:16.070 --> 07:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
sort of disappeared into the cobit haze
 
07:30:17.270 --> 07:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
last year
 
07:30:19.430 --> 07:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
it would be really nice to sort of pick
 
07:30:27.960 --> 07:30:27.970 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:27.970 --> 07:30:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:30:31.030 --> 07:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:30:36.468 --> 07:30:36.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:38.230 --> 07:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative trump
 
07:30:39.830 --> 07:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
07:30:41.670 --> 07:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh probably a question of the chair i'm
 
07:30:44.628 --> 07:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out
 
07:30:47.590 --> 07:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
what a felony charge is and this myth so
 
07:30:50.388 --> 07:30:50.398 align:start position:0%
i think if i'm reading it correctly
 
07:30:52.788 --> 07:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor
 
07:30:55.350 --> 07:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
could be pled down or he didn't just
 
07:30:57.510 --> 07:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
charge you with a violation like
 
07:31:00.230 --> 07:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
having a tail light out
 
07:31:02.388 --> 07:31:02.398 align:start position:0%
but a class b
 
07:31:04.150 --> 07:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
is up to seven years in jail four
 
07:31:06.468 --> 07:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars fine yeah and five
 
07:31:09.750 --> 07:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
years probation let me clarify this so
 
07:31:12.150 --> 07:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
a class b misdemeanor
 
07:31:13.270 --> 07:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
there is
 
07:31:14.868 --> 07:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
a woman
 
07:31:25.590 --> 07:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:27.270 --> 07:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor
 
07:31:29.830 --> 07:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
can go down to they can charge you the
 
07:31:32.948 --> 07:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
state could charge you with a violation
 
07:31:34.868 --> 07:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a cloud it's not
 
07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as a violation but
 
07:31:39.830 --> 07:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
because it's still a criminal offense
 
07:31:41.750 --> 07:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
the class being misdemeanor but the only
 
07:31:44.230 --> 07:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
penalty is is a fun
 
07:31:45.990 --> 07:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's no you can be on probation as
 
07:31:47.350 --> 07:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
well but you can't
 
07:31:49.910 --> 07:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's really no chance of
 
07:31:56.230 --> 07:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:59.590 --> 07:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:01.750 --> 07:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out what the class
 
07:32:03.030 --> 07:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
would be is
 
07:32:04.868 --> 07:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
class b is when you're sent to jail five
 
07:32:06.948 --> 07:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
to seven years
 
07:32:09.190 --> 07:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
last week when you go to state proof
 
07:32:09.200 --> 07:32:11.030 align:start position:0%
last week when you go to state proof
yes

07:32:11.030 --> 07:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:32:13.830 --> 07:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that would be the second
 
07:32:15.750 --> 07:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
what's my understanding if
 
07:32:18.070 --> 07:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i will i will say that if a person
 
07:32:20.310 --> 07:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
does this once it is inherently wrong we
 
07:32:22.388 --> 07:32:22.398 align:start position:0%
talk about as intimate of an act as it
 
07:32:23.430 --> 07:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
will be
 
07:32:25.830 --> 07:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
to secretly record that person without
 
07:32:27.190 --> 07:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
their consent
 
07:32:29.590 --> 07:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
and then to distribute that
 
07:32:30.548 --> 07:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
and that
 
07:32:33.510 --> 07:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
in a domestic violence context
 
07:32:35.430 --> 07:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh often these video these images are
 
07:32:37.670 --> 07:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
often used as blackmail or enhanced
 
07:32:40.150 --> 07:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
abuse they use it to
 
07:32:42.230 --> 07:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
as a form of abuse meaning they will
 
07:32:43.990 --> 07:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
firmly disclose or publish it in
 
07:32:47.350 --> 07:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:48.708 --> 07:32:48.718 align:start position:0%

07:38:02.070 --> 07:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
and for a long time we've been trying to
 
07:38:16.868 --> 07:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:19.510 --> 07:38:19.520 align:start position:0%

07:38:27.030 --> 07:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
um i wasn't in here i think when um
 
07:38:29.110 --> 07:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
when um prime spencer
 
07:38:31.750 --> 07:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
monster testified but um
 
07:38:33.670 --> 07:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
i remember this bill from last year we
 
07:38:35.270 --> 07:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
did have it
 
07:38:38.788 --> 07:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
i don't remember what the vote was
 
07:38:40.230 --> 07:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure someone on the team might
 
07:38:40.240 --> 07:38:41.430 align:start position:0%
i'm sure someone on the team might
remember

07:38:41.430 --> 07:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
remember
 
07:38:44.628 --> 07:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
but um it's a great concern with
 
07:38:48.628 --> 07:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
what happens electronically now with um
 
07:38:51.910 --> 07:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
cameras with it's sort of like
 
07:38:53.590 --> 07:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
the bill that we just
 
07:38:53.600 --> 07:38:55.750 align:start position:0%
the bill that we just
passed

07:38:55.750 --> 07:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
passed
 
07:38:55.760 --> 07:38:56.628 align:start position:0%
passed
they're

07:38:56.628 --> 07:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
they're
 
07:39:00.070 --> 07:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
very close in nature
 
07:39:02.070 --> 07:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
about unwanted or
 
07:39:02.080 --> 07:39:07.830 align:start position:0%
about unwanted or
unsolicited

07:39:07.830 --> 07:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:15.910 --> 07:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:15.920 --> 07:39:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:39:17.510 --> 07:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:39:19.030 --> 07:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
07:39:34.788 --> 07:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:36.468 --> 07:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i liked about this
 
07:39:37.830 --> 07:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
because i remember i think it was last
 
07:39:37.840 --> 07:39:38.868 align:start position:0%
because i remember i think it was last
year

07:39:38.868 --> 07:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
year
 
07:39:40.948 --> 07:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
originally the penalties came out they
 
07:39:43.510 --> 07:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
were really strong penalties
 
07:39:43.520 --> 07:39:44.388 align:start position:0%
were really strong penalties
and

07:39:44.388 --> 07:39:44.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:39:46.948 --> 07:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
i want to say it was david or either me
 
07:39:48.868 --> 07:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
that talked to um
 
07:39:50.868 --> 07:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
the violations
 
07:39:53.430 --> 07:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
and um so this one started because we
 
07:39:54.708 --> 07:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
worried about young people and
 
07:39:56.788 --> 07:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
everything at the same time
 
07:39:58.788 --> 07:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
last time we talked a little bit about
 
07:40:01.350 --> 07:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know how silly they can be
 
07:40:04.388 --> 07:40:04.398 align:start position:0%
and um so um the prom sponsor as she
 
07:40:05.990 --> 07:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
said she had agreed that the first
 
07:40:06.000 --> 07:40:07.110 align:start position:0%
said she had agreed that the first
offense

07:40:07.110 --> 07:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
offense
 
07:40:08.230 --> 07:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
would be
 
07:40:09.590 --> 07:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor
 
07:40:11.590 --> 07:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
and um for a second or subsequent
 
07:40:11.600 --> 07:40:14.548 align:start position:0%
and um for a second or subsequent
offenses

07:40:14.548 --> 07:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:15.990 --> 07:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
07:40:21.030 --> 07:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:22.628 --> 07:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
i think you were trying to make it
 
07:40:22.638 --> 07:40:25.110 align:start position:0%
i think you were trying to make it
heavier

07:40:25.110 --> 07:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
heavier
 
07:40:26.230 --> 07:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
07:40:28.230 --> 07:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
that is a correct statement that the
 
07:40:31.270 --> 07:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
last term uh as a representative i
 
07:40:33.510 --> 07:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
fought very hard to
 
07:40:34.788 --> 07:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
i think i did a good job i didn't do a
 
07:40:37.750 --> 07:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
good job that did not happen
 
07:40:39.670 --> 07:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking to members of the of this
 
07:40:41.590 --> 07:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
committee i despite being the cheer i
 
07:40:43.030 --> 07:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
still don't think i have the support for
 
07:40:46.708 --> 07:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
that so i am the odd man out of that
 
07:40:49.350 --> 07:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
but at the same time just because i it's
 
07:40:49.360 --> 07:40:50.310 align:start position:0%
but at the same time just because i it's
not

07:40:50.310 --> 07:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:40:52.150 --> 07:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly drafted the way i wanted still
 
07:40:54.230 --> 07:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
creating a good policy
 
07:40:55.990 --> 07:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
and i
 
07:40:59.830 --> 07:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:01.030 --> 07:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
even i wouldn't like them amendment
 
07:41:01.040 --> 07:41:03.910 align:start position:0%
even i wouldn't like them amendment
better

07:41:03.910 --> 07:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:03.920 --> 07:41:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:41:07.670 --> 07:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:09.430 --> 07:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
07:41:13.110 --> 07:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
share that the docket for the 2020 bill
 
07:41:15.510 --> 07:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
um shows that the this committee passed
 
07:41:18.788 --> 07:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
the bill 20-0 and it was on
 
07:41:18.798 --> 07:41:19.670 align:start position:0%
the bill 20-0 and it was on
um

07:41:19.670 --> 07:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:41:22.310 --> 07:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
it was on consent i think
 
07:41:24.388 --> 07:41:24.398 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:41:28.708 --> 07:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:28.718 --> 07:41:30.628 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:41:30.628 --> 07:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:41:32.230 --> 07:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
i was going to say that representative
 
07:41:34.150 --> 07:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
harriet gathright has a has a really
 
07:41:36.708 --> 07:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
good memory um the one additional thing
 
07:41:38.628 --> 07:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
that we did in this in the subcommittee
 
07:41:39.750 --> 07:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
last year
 
07:41:42.070 --> 07:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
was um the aclu during the public
 
07:41:44.150 --> 07:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
hearing it had an objection that the
 
07:41:45.670 --> 07:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
07:41:47.990 --> 07:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have a requirement that the
 
07:41:50.548 --> 07:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
recipient actually be harassed annoyed
 
07:41:53.030 --> 07:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
or alarmed by that electronic
 
07:41:54.868 --> 07:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
transmission so one of the things that
 
07:41:57.510 --> 07:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
we did in the subcommittee was we
 
07:42:00.230 --> 07:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
we uh we we made that change along with
 
07:42:02.628 --> 07:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
the change to the to the penalty
 
07:42:03.990 --> 07:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
07:42:05.830 --> 07:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we passed 20 to nothing last
 
07:42:05.840 --> 07:42:13.430 align:start position:0%
that's what we passed 20 to nothing last
year

07:42:13.430 --> 07:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:13.440 --> 07:42:14.628 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:42:14.628 --> 07:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:42:17.510 --> 07:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair relying on everyone's
 
07:42:18.708 --> 07:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
memory or
 
07:42:20.230 --> 07:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
chair's memory
 
07:42:25.110 --> 07:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:30.548 --> 07:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:30.558 --> 07:42:33.270 align:start position:0%
 
who

07:42:33.270 --> 07:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:35.030 --> 07:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
and he had consent well how does
 
07:42:38.948 --> 07:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:38.958 --> 07:42:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:42:39.990 --> 07:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:42:42.310 --> 07:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
i i can answer that
 
07:42:44.388 --> 07:42:44.398 align:start position:0%
that's one of it doesn't be very fact
 
07:42:44.398 --> 07:42:45.590 align:start position:0%
that's one of it doesn't be very fact
specific

07:42:45.590 --> 07:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
specific
 
07:42:45.600 --> 07:42:47.430 align:start position:0%
specific
but

07:42:47.430 --> 07:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:42:49.110 --> 07:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that the state has the
 
07:42:50.388 --> 07:42:50.398 align:start position:0%
burden of proof you know the reason
 
07:42:50.398 --> 07:42:51.590 align:start position:0%
burden of proof you know the reason
without

07:42:51.590 --> 07:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
without
 
07:42:53.350 --> 07:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
if if you are in an intimate
 
07:42:55.270 --> 07:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
relationship with someone and have been
 
07:42:56.948 --> 07:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
for some time and there's been foes
 
07:42:58.388 --> 07:42:58.398 align:start position:0%
exchanged three or four months back the
 
07:42:59.990 --> 07:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
biggest concern was people the
 
07:43:01.910 --> 07:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
relationship went sour
 
07:43:03.830 --> 07:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden they bought
 
07:43:05.830 --> 07:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
woodwork all these all of this
 
07:43:05.840 --> 07:43:06.868 align:start position:0%
woodwork all these all of this
this

07:43:06.868 --> 07:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:43:07.990 --> 07:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
07:43:09.670 --> 07:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
data on when that photo was originally
 
07:43:11.430 --> 07:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
created when it was sent
 
07:43:14.150 --> 07:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
if you're if there's evidence that the
 
07:43:16.070 --> 07:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
phone was said well but people were in a
 
07:43:16.080 --> 07:43:17.590 align:start position:0%
phone was said well but people were in a
relationship

07:43:17.590 --> 07:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
07:43:19.350 --> 07:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
it is going to be much more difficult to
 
07:43:20.868 --> 07:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
prove this if the parties are going
 
07:43:22.708 --> 07:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
through a divorce or if they separated
 
07:43:25.110 --> 07:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
the restraining orders involved
 
07:43:27.270 --> 07:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
or in situations where the person
 
07:43:28.868 --> 07:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't even know the other person or
 
07:43:30.548 --> 07:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
they barely know each other
 
07:43:32.948 --> 07:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
i you would be able to prove but that
 
07:43:35.750 --> 07:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be evidence of saying dog said
 
07:43:37.430 --> 07:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
also if there's an exchange of back and
 
07:43:40.388 --> 07:43:40.398 align:start position:0%
forth of
 
07:43:41.750 --> 07:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want to get into the details but
 
07:43:43.590 --> 07:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can be
 
07:43:45.750 --> 07:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
messages or comments that you know
 
07:43:47.510 --> 07:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
go into it so there's a lot of ways to
 
07:43:49.510 --> 07:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
prove it but ultimately
 
07:43:53.430 --> 07:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:55.430 --> 07:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
but if there's nothing to show
 
07:43:57.030 --> 07:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
it was just unsolicited at all it would
 
07:43:58.230 --> 07:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
just be great
 
07:43:58.240 --> 07:44:00.230 align:start position:0%
just be great
really

07:44:00.230 --> 07:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
really
 
07:44:14.150 --> 07:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:14.160 --> 07:44:22.468 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:44:22.468 --> 07:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:26.150 --> 07:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:28.868 --> 07:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
represent holden um you race vocal once

07:44:34.708 --> 07:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
if you've already spoken
 
07:44:36.468 --> 07:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
the chair is not going to recognize
 
07:44:40.070 --> 07:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:40.080 --> 07:44:41.270 align:start position:0%
