um
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice for
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
m l Dax
 
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.930 align:start position:0%
m l Dax
and

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
you know representative groda has an
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
amendment if you want to just mention
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry this is Senate Bill 44. yep
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
so incident Bill 44 originally
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
um criminal justice degrees were
 
00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:07.099 align:start position:0%
accepted for this um well a specific
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice Criminal Justice degree
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
that was being offered by
 
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
snow was in the
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
um was in the bill however they're no
 
00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
longer offering that
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
class or that that series of courses so
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that is eliminated from the Builds
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
however they are going to enroll making
 
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.510 align:start position:0%
however they are going to enroll making
allow

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
um criminal justice degrees should these
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
specific courses be included in their
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
course of study so that's why the
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to house to Senate Bill 44 was
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
made and that's how the amendment is
 
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
written okay and uh director Courtney if
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
come up I just have a question
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
I just want to verify that uh
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
well you can introduce yourself
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
certainly Lindsey Courtney executive
 
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
director oplc so my question is um since
 
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
there is a list
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
of degrees that meet the requirement is
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
there any problem adding something else
 
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
later in rulemaking or is that
 
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
I think as long as it is consistent with
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
the statutory definition then that that
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
would be okay I do know that they
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
currently already permit the what was
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
this new program under their existing
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
statutory framework so I don't think a
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
statutory change would be necessary
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
right but I mean this amendment would
 
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.370 align:start position:0%
right but I mean this amendment would
remove

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
remove
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice one and I'm
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
wondering if it's actually removed from
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
statute if you'd be able to allow it
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
under rulemaking that's my question oh
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
so my understanding was that Senate Bill
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
44 as introduced added the criminal
 
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.370 align:start position:0%
44 as introduced added the criminal
justice

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
um degree as a possible Pathway to
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
licensure it doesn't presently exist in
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
statute so by amending it to remove that
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
I think we would just be left with the
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
status quo okay but the question I mean
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
the question is if that criminal justice
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
program were offered again
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
for it to be accepted would it could
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
that be done in rule making or would it
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
require a statutory change I think it
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
could be done under rulemaking as the
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
board is presently already allowing that
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
it provided it meets the 60 hours
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
master's degree requirement okay thank
 
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.110 align:start position:0%
master's degree requirement okay thank
you

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
um any other comment on this
 
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.850 align:start position:0%
um any other comment on this
questions

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.250 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
um in that case if somebody has emotion
 
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
um in that case if somebody has emotion
yeah

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
I've got in here somewhere but what's
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%

we recommendations
otpa

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
easy I'm hoping and then
 
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.690 align:start position:0%
easy I'm hoping and then
um

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
we'll go on to
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
all right so this is the uh
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
put some requirements on
 
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
what really sorts of things they can't
 
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.030 align:start position:0%
what really sorts of things they can't
do

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
um at least from my standpoint the
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
biggest well there's two big ones one is
 
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.030 align:start position:0%
biggest well there's two big ones one is
um

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
sort of bait and switch where they offer
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
somebody at a certain price at the last
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
minute they say oh somebody else is
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
offering more so they raise the price
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
me I think I'd rather see it dealt with
 
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.210 align:start position:0%
me I think I'd rather see it dealt with
by

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the contract to see if it's
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
in there and if it's uh if it's not
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
valid under the contract to get the AG
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
to handle it but I guess that's not
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
working so
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and the other one is the prohibition
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
placing a nurse who is not
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
you know qualified to actually practice
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339 align:start position:0%
due to license not you know licensing
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
problems or suspension so there's an
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
amendment to that
 
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.590 align:start position:0%
amendment to that
um

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I I believe I gave
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
you all the copies of the amendment so I
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the amendment number it's
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
right there on the table okay just a
 
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
it should be 1463 H is that uh
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
yes okay cool
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
so if you could uh just describe what's
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
um there was a
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
hanging prepositional clause for such
 
00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
reason and then I didn't State a reason
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
so we scratched we eliminated that
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
clause and I believe it's on page two I
 
00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:32.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
the original bill it's on page two lines
 
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh eight and nine at the end of line
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
eight and uh
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
yeah nurse agencies may not shall not
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
commit the services of a single nurse or
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant to more than
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
one Health Care Facility for the same
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
time period or shift and cancel a
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
commitment to a facility or compel that
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
facility to bid again for services
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
always prompt already promised it for
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
such reason but as you said yeah there's
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
nowhere up above does it say reason so
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
that makes no sense so that's I believe
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's the only change the amendment to
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
the bill that this amendment
 
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.370 align:start position:0%
the bill that this amendment
um

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's the amendment to the front
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
to the bill so any questions or comments
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
on the amendment or the bill itself
 
00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
on the amendment or the bill itself
actually

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
okay Glenn representative Bailey
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
um I have a problem on page two Roman
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
numeral three where you can't charge
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
extra under extraordinary circumstances
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay I don't care for that I believe
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
that's a violation of the law of supply
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
and demand which is a higher law than
 
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.189 align:start position:0%
and demand which is a higher law than
this

00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:48.290 align:start position:0%
this
yeah

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.129 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I can see that but
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that sets a
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
limit on
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know when what they could bid for
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
under providing a nurse in any
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
circumstance so there is I understand
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
that I mean the the
 
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
you know this may provide a little help
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is a significant
 
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
solution of the problem I think the real
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
solution is is to get more uh
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
nurses working
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
because I mean we've done some stuff for
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
her and there's you know wouldn't that
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
be achieved by paying a higher rate well
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
they this doesn't prevent them from
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
charging a higher rate it's just bumping
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
it up for certain circumstances
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if I may yes I think we heard
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
in testimony what was happening is after
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
contracts were made there were fees
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
added on above and beyond
 
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.310 align:start position:0%
added on above and beyond
um

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
due to instances such as coven once a
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
contract was made they were tacking on
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
an extra fifty dollar fee or sixty
 
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
dollar fee and if someone out there can
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
clarify whether I'm right or wrong on
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
that I think that's what I heard in
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
testimony and this is what that's trying
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
to prevent what's the contracts done to
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
say well we're in an emergency and by
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
the way the contract you sign we're
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
attacking on another such and such I see
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
that as similar to the problem of the
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
agree to provide a nurse at some price
 
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
and they say oh somebody's willing to
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
pay more almost literally at the last
 
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
minute and uh and bumping it up which
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
I suppose to you know depending on the
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
contracts written that may or may not be
 
00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
a violation of contract but uh I think
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
we heard and maybe somebody here can
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
speak to it that they had contracts that
 
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
didn't mention increases due to the
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
Infectious Disease situation and then
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
they added the requirement at the last
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
minute I don't know if anybody
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
you want to come up and just introduce
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
yourself and
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
speak to that
foreign

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
committee Paula minihan from the
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
hospital Association I believe that is
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
accurate I recall that in the testimony
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
as well from some of the um individuals
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
that actually signed these contracts so
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we're trying to
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
address right I mean I don't have proof
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
of that but we certainly heard testimony
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
that that was going on and that's what
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
this is meant to
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
effect I mean if they but there's no
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
limit on me the charge they can charge
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
for providing a nurse so
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
which wouldn't make sense anyway I mean
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
because they're going to have to pay
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
what they're gonna have to pay to get
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
somebody any other questions or
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
discussions all right
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
would someone like to make a motion
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
in a second I'll second
 
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.010 align:start position:0%
in a second I'll second
okay

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
all right any other any discussion on
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
this I do also want to make it
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
um Mrs minahan reminded me that we did
 
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
change the RSA reference oh that's right
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me for forgetting that
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it was uh which makes it a separate
 
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.450 align:start position:0%
yeah it was uh which makes it a separate
registration

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I separate um RSA reference
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
was this is this is one that is not
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
being currently used so here we're going
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
to put it there right and um I think it
 
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
was under 326b which was the nursing one
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
and I mean they weren't I know they
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
weren't going to
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
when the nursing board wasn't going to
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with with this
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
anyway it's just the office so it didn't
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
make sense for it to be there okay thank
 
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.270 align:start position:0%
make sense for it to be there okay thank
you

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to vote on whether
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
or not to adopt Amendment 1463 h
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
to Senate bill 149.
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%

no and uh Groudon yes and the chair
 
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:04.460 align:start position:0%
votes yes so that's four to one
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
and do we have another motion
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
we'll have to pass as amended okay
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
any discussion probably not okay uh and
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
and we're voting on ought to pass
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
with Amendment 1463 age for Senate Bill
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%

Bailey no
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
okay and yes and the chair votes yes so
 
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:45.380 align:start position:0%
again that's four to one
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%

the chair would like to call
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
Representative Carol McGuire uh who will
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.619 --> 01:03:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
1502h

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
1502h
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
and Carol McGuire representing Merrimack
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
27 which is Allenstown Dunbarton Epsom
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
and Hooksett
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
and this amendment to 74
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
is a request of the Department of
 
01:03:59.089 --> 01:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
administrative Services also and it is
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
prime looks like a lot of little cleanup
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
and language adjustment you'll have to
 
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
ask them about the details but
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
none of it looks like it's making any
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
major changes to policy
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
and if you have technical questions I
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
will defer to the department if you have
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
other questions I'll be glad to answer
 
01:04:21.059 --> 01:04:21.890 align:start position:0%
other questions I'll be glad to answer
them

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%

um and good morning representative
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
McGuire I I'm wondering whether the
 
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment has been discussed
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
with any members of the Senate as well
 
01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
it has been discussed with the prime
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
sponsor Senator Carson who doesn't
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
object to it but didn't think she should
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment to the house
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
I I didn't hear the last part she didn't
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
think she should bring an amendment to
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
the house but she has no objections to
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%

first month for introducing our
Amendment

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
um this bill we requested Senator Carson
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
to sponsor in the Senate and we we had a
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
hearing with them and the question was
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh where these amendments discussed in
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh and I'll explain that
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
Lori rudis is our director of personnel
 
01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
and she was hired back in 2018 2018 and
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
we actually in the recruitment process
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
talked about the need to update our
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
state Personnel system Charlie and I
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
were working together and working with
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
the agencies and there was a lot of
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
frustration about really an archaic
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
Personnel system that had been
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
established about 50 years ago and that
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't Nimble and didn't allow managers
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
to respond to whatever their business
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
needs were and we knew we had to
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
modernize the system and and make it
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
more flexible and and have it work for
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
okay okay sorry
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
um so um much of this bill
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
is updating of language to support the
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
changes to the Personnel system that the
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
division of personnel is doing what are
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
they doing
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
um we when Lori came in we had a
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
Personnel system with more than 2 000
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
working titles for kinds of jobs across
 
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
state government we are reducing number
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
the numbers of titles and taking our
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
jobs in the state Personnel system and
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
mapping them back to National standards
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
for standard occupational codes and
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
um and having our system therefore be
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
more flexible to what is this position
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
what's the nature of it and what level
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
should it be so when we when we tie to
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
National standards there are there are
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
words that we have used in the past to
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
describe processes safer changing
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
positions that no longer will apply one
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
of those words that you'll see that
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking to be
 
01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.390 align:start position:0%
we're asking to be
um

01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
removed from the law is reallocation
 
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
when we have a position let and I'll
 
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
I'll make it a stark contrast when we
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
have a position let's say it's a
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
secretary and we say I don't need a
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
secretary I need a manager we we do a
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
process called reclassification that is
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
going to be the new terminology and that
 
01:08:22.809 --> 01:08:22.819 align:start position:0%
is an example of the kind of of
 
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
vocabulary changes that you'll see in
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
the bill why didn't we catch this stuff
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
earlier we're doing a lot of work on
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
many fronts all at the same time so
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
between the Senate hearing and today
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
we've continued to comb through the law
 
01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
and and over here on my right is Matt
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
maver George Matt is an attorney he
 
01:08:45.289 --> 01:08:45.299 align:start position:0%
worked in the AG's office for more than
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
a dozen years and he works with Lori to
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
comb through the laws the administrative
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
rules to to make sure that we're looking
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
forward with those and proposing changes
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
that support the modernization of the
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
system so I'm happy to walk through the
 
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
bill in the changes if you'd like or or
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
I whatever you would please
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we need to go probably
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
into quite that detail on it
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
um are you willing to take questions
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
sure representative Schmidt
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and good
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
morning to all of you from Das uh I'm
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
asking this question in my capacity as a
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
member of the jcec uh which commissioner
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus is the one of the uh primary
 
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
operators here and uh and uh also on our
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
committee is the new chair of the JCC
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative leckis and so I'm
 
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
wondering uh the the the terminology
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
changes that you're that you're talking
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
about uh are they also in the in the
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of or in the category of
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
classification changes because that's
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
what uh jcec is a task with uh I'm
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could speak to that
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
issue sure the the jcec the joint
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
committee and employee classification is
 
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
um is functionally the governing body of
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
the unclassified system uh unclassified
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
employees are typically appointed
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
employees with three of us all happen to
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
be unclassified
 
01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:26.060 align:start position:0%
um and they they tend to be
 
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and and the like
 
01:10:29.219 --> 01:10:31.189 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and and the like
um

01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
this is all about the classified system
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
which is the 11
 
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.410 align:start position:0%
which is the 11
000

01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:37.970 align:start position:0%
000
um

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
regular normal typical state employees
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the 346 or 48 or whatever
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
um class unclassified employees so none
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the none of it is relevant in that
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
system and and the you know the word
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
structures are different the you know
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
the the big difference is that that
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the changes that were made
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
73 years ago if we're counting
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
um to the classified system back in my
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
youth in your youth yes in uh in 1950
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
um is uh they govern everybody and
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of technical language I
 
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of what's going on you know
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
increases in salary because becomes
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
changes in compensation and that kind of
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
thing year after year people just don't
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
bother you know the the you know we do
 
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
what we do and the law says something
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
close to what we do and we just let it
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
go and it because it doesn't stop us
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
from doing it but this is about making
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
you know the law uses terms that we
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
actually use and so you don't read the
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
statue and go well what they mean is
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
like it says reallocation but it's just
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
everything that we call a
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
reclassification oh okay and this makes
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
all those kind of changes but it doesn't
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
affect the jcec processor language at
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
all thank you
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm taking a look at um the
 
01:11:57.239 --> 01:11:58.430 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm taking a look at um the
amendment

01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
and trying to see what it changes so the
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that affects section six as
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
far as I've gotten as far as I can tell
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
let me know if I'm missing something all
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
it does is remove three words at the end
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
or the board
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
um the rest of it just looking through
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
it it seems identical so it is it does
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
it do anything else
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
yes the the I mean frankly the
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh the amount if you think of the
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
amendment as as our lawyer having looked
 
01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
at the draft that came out and looked at
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
oh wait they that word's missing and
 
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
that because in in anytime you draft
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
something occasionally you know because
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
things are added and subtracted somebody
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
goes oh wait wait wait wait wait we
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
forgot to
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
no people left out the and or the word
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
assigning for example is added so it's
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
all it's very legalistic I guess
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I may follow up yeah my
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
specific question is on that
 
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:55.820 align:start position:0%
um the part that affects section six
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
isn't changing anything other than the
 
01:13:00.649 --> 01:13:00.659 align:start position:0%
three words at the end removing them
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
from section six
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative Billy
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
I just have a question as to why
 
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.410 align:start position:0%
I just have a question as to why
um

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
when we are looking to provide these
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
bonuses of doing whatever we're doing
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
why we are no longer involving um for
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
spending money involving the fiscal
 
01:13:30.719 --> 01:13:33.530 align:start position:0%
spending money involving the fiscal
committee

01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
I think that what you're what your might
 
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
be referencing in is it in the general
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
Bill where we're um where you're gonna
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
where you see the uh redaction of the
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention bonuses yes on
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
can a committee to
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
um to empower the division of personnel
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
to establish a program to award
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
um Recruitment and Retention bonuses and
 
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:15.020 align:start position:0%
um that bill got amended in the Senate
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it required those those changes in
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
the Senate required approval of the
 
01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal Committee of policies and and
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
payment amounts and that the Senate put
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
in a sunset provision into that
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the their amendment of that bill and
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
um since that time we did we did
 
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:38.420 align:start position:0%
establish a recruitment
 
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
bonus program and a retention bonus
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
program funded by arpa funds approved by
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal policies approved by fiscal but
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
that law sunsets and so
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
pardon June 30th June 30th at at the end
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
of this biennium so um that's why you
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
when I go to and let me find it I had it
 
01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:17.780 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go to page six
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh line starting on line 13 the salary
 
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.669 align:start position:0%
uh line starting on line 13 the salary
adjustment

01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bill itself left your money yes
 
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:28.340 align:start position:0%
Page Six
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
the director of personnel has approved
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
beginning compensation at a step higher
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
than the minimum step
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say that
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
they may increase
 
01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.470 align:start position:0%
they may increase
for

01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
the salary for others in the similar
 
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
the salary for others in the similar
positions

01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
if it affects
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
now we've
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
we're here in her to build not too long
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
ago with nursing staffing agencies and
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
the problem they were having when they
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
were recruiting and hiring nurses from
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
travel agencies at higher pay and there
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of animosity of people
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
making more and I guess my question is
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
if you're going to hire someone at a
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
higher pay grade doing the same work
 
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.709 align:start position:0%
higher pay grade doing the same work
then

01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
automatically move the rest of those
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
Folks up doing the same work if you want
 
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
to retain them
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
you um it's actually what the bill is is
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
trying to address is there are
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
situations where that happens and and if
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
you think about it
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
um in a
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give us an example in in a
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
division you you hire somebody uh
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
um you hire somebody for one particular
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
job and they have the similar title and
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
it happens to be you know labor grade
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
let's just say 25 and they're a step
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
four somebody else comes in and and
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
based on on where they were where they
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
were coming from their level of
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
experience you hire them uh occasionally
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
at maybe a step eight
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
um once in a while that happens as a
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
one-off you know somebody's getting
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
hired right out of college into a job
 
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
somebody else is getting hired who's
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
been working for 20 years and and they
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
they come in because of where they their
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
life experience and on a in a one-off
 
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
case that can happen a lot and and
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
everybody doesn't necessarily get
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
adjusted the the situation where it's
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
mostly problematic is when
 
01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:24.950 align:start position:0%
mostly problematic is when
um

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh the job market changes and I'm going
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
to use I'm going to use for example our
 
01:17:31.729 --> 01:17:31.739 align:start position:0%
ground screw right the job market
 
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
changes there's no chance we can hire
 
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
anybody at step one there's just you
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
know you can you can do much better than
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
that at Dunkin Donuts and so what what
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
happens is you're hiring people at that
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
point at step five everybody who comes
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
in and gets hired at step five you've
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
got you've got a handful of people who
 
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
were at step three and and aren't in the
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
way the normal system works necessarily
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
adjust it the idea is to get some
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
authority to do that to address the
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
issue you're talking about why why would
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
we say to the guy who's at step three
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
look it's not that you don't have the
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
experience it's not that it's not that
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
you know he's been doing this for 40
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
years and you're new
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
um he just happened to get hired at a
 
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
different time and the somebody could
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
make that make that adjustment and this
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
grants that Authority today there's no
 
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
authority to do that they would have to
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
frankly the the quote unquote work
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
around as they would quit
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then you would rehire them and
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
that's a little cheesy and so this is to
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
give the the state an opportunity to do
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
something that's not cheesy if that
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh that is the last pink card I have on
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
SB 74 was there anybody else in the room
 
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.610 --> 01:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
saying none I will close the public
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on SB 74
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%

oh

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.189 align:start position:0%
oh

sure
 
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
since we do have a quorum
 
01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.110 align:start position:0%
since we do have a quorum
and

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention that today is
 
01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:26.169 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention that today is
Wednesday

01:19:26.169 --> 01:19:26.179 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
obviously and the deadline for committee
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%

01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%

Amendment

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
and bring out Amendment 1502 H is there
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's a second thank you
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say anything you wish
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion there your
 
01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion there your
second

01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
oh I have a question Madam chair and I'm
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
not sure who it goes to but I guess it's
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
just a discussion item
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
so one thing that really goes against my
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
spirit is when we have funds that res
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
that we receive through grants and then
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's sunsets that's what I just heard
 
01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
and maybe I didn't hear that correctly
 
01:20:58.739 --> 01:21:00.169 align:start position:0%
and maybe I didn't hear that correctly
that

01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's a fiscal note there's no money on
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
it and then we would
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
those funds expire and then what happens
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
is that tax paying money that has to now
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
go to that I'm I'm just unsure thank you
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
I and representative oh
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'll give my understanding of this and
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
then correct me if I'm wrong because I'm
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
not certain I'm right and that is I
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
think the uh the arpa funds are being
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
used as I understand it for
 
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:31.970 align:start position:0%
used as I understand it for
um

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
you know the hiring bonuses to get more
 
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
people in
 
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
but that that program sunsets and I
 
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure whether it was
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
June 30th this year said at the end of
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
the biennium which would be next year if
 
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's correct but in any case it
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
sunsets as well and then the grant money
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
presumably sunsets and so we're not
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
sending my understanding is we're not
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
setting ourselves up for an ongoing
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
expense when the grant money goes away
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding my
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the bonuses are
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
paid when the people are hired and if we
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
do it right there will not be any money
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
left over to turn back to the federal
 
01:22:06.239 --> 01:22:07.250 align:start position:0%
left over to turn back to the federal
government

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes although it's possible that there
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
will be money turned over the federal
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
government because it but there's
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's no obligations of the state
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's not an ongoing obligation of any
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
sort so programs are all expiring when
 
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
is it actually expiring it's a June 30th
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
of this year this year okay thank you
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank thank you thank you for your for
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
the uh and information representative
 
01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yes okay
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
good any other questions or comments
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
issues I have a question so uh your
 
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
Amendment as representative leckis was
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
at least alluding to uh does
 
01:22:51.719 --> 01:22:52.510 align:start position:0%
at least alluding to uh does
um

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
basically make
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh there are a number of changes that
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
are made in the in at Senate bill 74.
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
and your Amendment picks all those
 
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
changes up
 
01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
and and and and repeats the impeach them
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and incorporates them and so forth and
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh so the the only question I have is
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
has this been carefully vetted with
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
regard to just the secretarial aspect if
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
you will because otherwise there's a lot
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
of you know you keep looking this way
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
and you're shifting back and forth net
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
effect is nothing to some degree
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
different than is already in the bill
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
but if it hasn't been carefully vetted
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
then it could be that we're
 
01:23:41.209 --> 01:23:41.219 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to pick it all up
 
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
again in the Senate because
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.709 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
and Miss Keane have
 
01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:04.490 align:start position:0%
and Miss Keane have
good

01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
and if you find it at first glance at
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
first glance I was seeing the same
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
things that representative like has
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
pointed out it's the same thing and
 
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
there are very few additional changes in
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
your Amendment but the bottom line is
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
there those are there and if it's if
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
they've carefully vetted it it's on you
 
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.070 align:start position:0%
they've carefully vetted it it's on you
no

01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
and since they're the ones that are
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
going to have to follow these
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I would just make the comment that as
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
the commissioner stated that the current
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
steps for certain positions are not
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
adequate to attract employees or retain
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
employees that perhaps you should
 
01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
consider increasing steps for certain
 
01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.130 align:start position:0%
consider increasing steps for certain
positions

01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm sure they will take
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
that to heart
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
and to budget
 
01:25:09.719 --> 01:25:12.229 align:start position:0%
and to budget
representative

01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
um this is more of a follow-on question
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
so it if this ends in June this bill
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
says it would pass after 60 days would
 
01:25:21.659 --> 01:25:22.490 align:start position:0%
says it would pass after 60 days would
that

01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
that
then

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
why would we be passing it I didn't
 
01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.970 align:start position:0%
why would we be passing it I didn't
understand

01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
the grant the arpa grants end in 60 days
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
which means that they would not be able
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
to pay bonus recruitment bonuses from
 
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
those grants
 
01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
after the end of June but the but
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to do so under current
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
law correct
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
I mean clearly as they have been paying
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
recruitment bonuses
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
the the bonus part so the the
 
01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
the Bill's not in it's only a little
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
tiny piece of the bill that it's the the
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
arpa funded retention and recruitment
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
things and and those are all those are
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
all going away but the rest of the bill
 
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
and that's so that's the the rest of the
 
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
bill takes effect in 60 days the arpa
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
thing just goes away
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative blackis yeah I mean
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
again if I understand the uh we we
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
passed a uh a bill last time letting
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
them do this to have the arpa thing and
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
that the change related the arpa thing
 
01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
as I understand is if you look on page
 
01:26:31.739 --> 01:26:34.250 align:start position:0%
as I understand is if you look on page
one

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
um you know from 13 to page two
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
eight it's just deleting that stuff so
 
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
the money's going away and the authority
 
01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
to do it is going to
 
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:50.870 align:start position:0%
to do it is going to
win

01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you commissioner is is there a
 
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
specific time limit that the arpa funds
 
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
have to be used by and have they all
 
01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.970 align:start position:0%
have to be used by and have they all
been

01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:06.980 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
I I think the bonus programs are
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
essentially done
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.709 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
no so they're all they're all they were
 
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
one-time events and and they've all
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
expired at this point
 
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up follow-up and did were we
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
able to use all of those funding
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
according to the rules the the funding
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
that was allocated by fiscal from the
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
arpa funds is
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to say all because all
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
implies 100 most
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
um we you know there's a there's a
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
budget we kind of knew how many
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
positions were covered by the
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
um the retention incentives Etc and uh
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
and we had a decent estimate of how many
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
people would get hired
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and it and it worked out so we were
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
we were pretty close but there's someone
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
there's some left over that goes back to
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
arpa and and then don't ask me what they
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
do because I have in the focus
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
spend it foolishly no doubt
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's that same section that's
 
01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:23.540 align:start position:0%
being deleted
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
the Roman numeral six developing a
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
program for the recruitment selection
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
placement and retention of specified
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
applicants in the state service and then
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
everything after it is deleted
 
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of wondering why is that
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
even there then unless you need this
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
all of the stuff you should have a
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
program for Recruitment and Retention
 
01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:49.940 align:start position:0%
but they won't have the specific
 
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
arpa-funded bonus program but they
 
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
should have a plan for how they're going
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
to I just wondered if we needed another
 
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
line of strikeouts but no there needs to
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
be something that would certainly hope
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
they have a program for recruiting
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody does I mean
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
if you run a agency
 
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
a hot dog stand or anything you have a
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
plan for Recruitment and Retention and
 
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
you know we have a we have a unit that
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
helps with recruitment just the
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority here is not
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
necessary for that operational
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.139 --> 01:29:30.169 align:start position:0%
 
comments

01:29:30.169 --> 01:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
all right in that case the motion is to
 
01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
adopt yes
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
who's that
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
one second
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
all right so representative sorry
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
no I think I moved my
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's okay and it just
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
startled me the Deputy Commissioner
 
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
seems to be on the verge of speaking
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
almost without permission
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
you can't have that but she she clearly
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
wants to say something and I
 
01:30:05.689 --> 01:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
say all I was gonna say when back to the
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention program is
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
um the strikeouts about the Recruitment
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
and Retention program reflect
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 226 from last session
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
that authorized the the program that
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
again in the law Sunset it so the
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
strikeouts reflect the law that
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
sunsetted and the language that remains

thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
Edna committee I'm Grant bossy from the
 
01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Senate introducing Senate
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
Bill 108 on behalf of Senator Sharon
 
01:50:16.729 --> 01:50:16.739 align:start position:0%
Carson the Bill's Prime sponsor as you
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
well know New Hampshire's public
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
defender program has a recruitment and
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
retention problem something that most
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
businesses and government agencies are
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
currently facing a recent survey of
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
public defenders found that high case
 
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
loads and low salary were the two
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
biggest challenges but Access to Health
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
Care ranked third SB 108 would allow
 
01:50:37.850 --> 01:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
public defenders to opt in to the State
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
Health Plan providing both better
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
coverage at lower cost and since this is
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
a 100 percent General funded program
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
lower cost would mean savings to
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the Senate Amendment changed
 
01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
the effective date from 60 days after
 
01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
passage to a pond passage this is order
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
in order to align with their current
 
01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
insurance contract which expires June
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
30th SB 108 received unanimous support
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
from the Senate Edna and finance
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
committees as well as the full Senate
 
01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
it's an important tool to help fill
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
vacancies in our public defender program
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
lower case loads and cut into the
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
backlog of 650 cases now pending Senator
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
Carson thanks you for your consideration
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
and ask for your support of Senate Bill
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
108 thank you
 
01:51:23.689 --> 01:51:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.699 --> 01:51:24.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
I you said that this was General funded
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
which seems to imply it's funded from
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
the general fund I I'm suspecting that's
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
not the case would you like to
 
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
indicate where the money comes from uh I
 
01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
was told that this was a general fund
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
appropriation I could be wrong on that
 
01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
after there'll be people back here to
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
could you restate with the number one
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
and number two reason for
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
leaving yeah I don't have the survey
 
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
results uh in front of me but they were
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
is representative gold so the hope is
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
by offering this additional benefit
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to recruit and hire more
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
public defenders which will lower
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
caseloads and attack item number one
 
01:52:30.169 --> 01:52:30.179 align:start position:0%
that is the hope I don't think Senator
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
Carson believes that would solve the
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
problem completely but it's another tool
 
01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
at the margins to get people into the
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
public defender program instead of going
 
01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
to another practice
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you madam chair okay
 
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:59.709 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:52:59.709 --> 01:52:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
just turned your mic off
 
01:53:04.609 --> 01:53:04.619 align:start position:0%

01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
name is Sarah Rothman I'm the executive
 
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire public
 
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
defender I've been at the public
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
defender uh for 15 years
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
um as you likely know
 
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
um there are both federal and state
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements for the
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
state to provide legal representation to
 
01:53:24.129 --> 01:53:24.139 align:start position:0%
defendants who cannot afford an attorney
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
we fulfill that role in New Hampshire so
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
we contract with the state we contract
 
01:53:32.689 --> 01:53:32.699 align:start position:0%
through the judicial Council to provide
 
01:53:35.570 --> 01:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
representation to every Indigent
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
defendant in our court system we
 
01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:38.770 align:start position:0%
defendant in our court system we
represent

01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
well north of 80 percent of all criminal
 
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
defendants in New Hampshire in New
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire an additional in addition to
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional requirements
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
requiring that we exist there's actually
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
also a statute in New Hampshire that
 
01:53:53.689 --> 01:53:53.699 align:start position:0%
requires the state of New Hampshire to
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
contract with a firm to provide this
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
representation to Indigent defendants we
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
have been we were founded in 1972 so we
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
we've been in existence for 50 years and
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
we've contracted with the state since
 
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
1985. we've been the provider of these
 
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
services to the citizens of New
 
01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:13.790 align:start position:0%
services to the citizens of New
Hampshire

01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
we're here today asking to you to
 
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
approve this legislation because it will
 
01:54:20.930 --> 01:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
benefit all stakeholders in the criminal
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
all stakeholders that includes judges
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
Court staff City and County Prosecutors
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
victims of crime and defendants are
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
impacted by retention problems at the
 
01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public Defender
 
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
when nhpd cannot retain its staff it
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
results in delays and logistical
 
01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
problems for everyone involved in the
 
01:54:43.619 --> 01:54:44.570 align:start position:0%
problems for everyone involved in the
system

01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
When we struggle due to staff attrition
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
it makes it more difficult for everyone
 
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
in the system to do their job
 
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
so we aren't just asking you to help
 
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
improve the lives of our employees we're
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
asking you to help the criminal justice
 
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire to function
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
since fiscal year 2021 alone
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
140 employees have left the New
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Defender
 
01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
52 employees left in fiscal year 2022.
 
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's an average of one employee every
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
single week
 
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
so far in the fiscal year 2023 we've
 
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
lost 43 employees and 22 of those have
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
been attorneys
 
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
every time we lose a staff member we
 
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
have to devote substantial resources to
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
recruiting interviewing and most
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
importantly training new staff members
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
when we lose attorneys and when we lose
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
investigators their caseloads must be
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
transferred to already overburdened
 
01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:41.629 align:start position:0%
transferred to already overburdened
colleagues

01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
and this then fuels more attrition
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
we need to break this cycle and this
 
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
legislation will help us to do that
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
why has attrition spiked at nhpd over
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the last four years
 
01:55:57.410 --> 01:55:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's because the benefits that draw that
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
used to draw people to the public
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
defender and key people at the public
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
defender have eroded over time
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
our health insurance has become more
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
expensive and for our employees and the
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
quality of the benefits has decreased
 
01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
the State Health Plan work will keep
 
01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
people at the New Hampshire Public
 
01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.790 align:start position:0%
people at the New Hampshire Public
Defender

01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
Defender
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
we are competing in a historically hot
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
job market with private sector and with
 
01:56:24.169 --> 01:56:24.179 align:start position:0%
neighboring public defenders
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
organizations that offer better pay and
 
01:56:26.639 --> 01:56:27.890 align:start position:0%
organizations that offer better pay and
benefits

01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
we will continue to struggle with
 
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
attrition if our staff can leave for a
 
01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
public defender program in a nearby
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
state that has a more attractive
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
I want to tell you that as the executive
 
01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
director of the public defender I am
 
01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:48.179 align:start position:0%
incredibly confident that this
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
legislation the ability to join the
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
State Health Plan will help retain our
 
01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
staff it will keep people I hear that
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
from people regularly
 
01:56:59.810 --> 01:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
that yes case laws are an issue I know
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
that was discussed earlier caseloads are
 
01:57:04.129 --> 01:57:04.139 align:start position:0%
an issue but again as was pointed out if
 
01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
we're able to retain and recruit staff
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
that will help with caseloads but what
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
we hear uh quite as frequently is that I
 
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
could deal with the with the caseload I
 
01:57:15.530 --> 01:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
understand that you know public defender
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
has high case loads but if I had better
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
benefits particularly if you know going
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
to the doctor was not sort of a
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
frightening event where I could be stuck
 
01:57:28.209 --> 01:57:28.219 align:start position:0%
with a large Bill where having a child
 
01:57:32.089 --> 01:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
is not so difficult to to do while
 
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're working at the public defender we
 
01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
hear that over and over again that
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
benefits will retain our staff and help
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
us recruit our staff
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
so our employees have been clear Health
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
Care is a priority for them the ability
 
01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
to join the State Health Plan would be a
 
01:57:49.129 --> 01:57:49.139 align:start position:0%
game changer for the public defender it
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
will draw people to nhpd and will keep
 
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
people here
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
and again this is a benefit not just for
 
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
our employees and not just for the
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
clients that we represent it's a benefit
 
01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
for the entire criminal justice system
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
if nhpd can better retain its staff all
 
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
stakeholders will benefit
 
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your time and for
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
considering this legislation
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Jeff thank you for
 
01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question on on page on on line
 
01:58:23.689 --> 01:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
six of the bill page one
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
the public defender program will
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
reimburse the state for the premiums
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
where do you get the money from sure
 
01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
to reimburse the state sure and so that
 
01:58:34.850 --> 01:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
ties into the earlier question we are
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
funded through the general fund we are
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
100 funded through the general fund and
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we it's kind of an interesting kind
 
01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
of just cycle so we get funding through
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
the state and then we pay the state for
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
the health insurance through our budget
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
so you're laundering funds from the gym
 
01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
general fund to the employee benefits
 
01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:55.370 align:start position:0%
general fund to the employee benefits
fund

01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:58:58.209 --> 01:58:58.219 align:start position:0%
essentially I see okay
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
representative true you have a follow-up
 
01:59:02.209 --> 01:59:02.219 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and on the last line uh on the last
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
two lines public defender program opts
 
01:59:09.649 --> 01:59:09.659 align:start position:0%
in if the public defender opts in it
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
should be for two years correct it
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're not holding people
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:20.089 --> 01:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
um I mean certainly yes we're dealing
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
with attrition for sure I mean certainly
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's been employees who've been here
 
01:59:26.089 --> 01:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
for we have some I think our longest
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
serving employee has been here for 36
 
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
years so we have plenty of staff that
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
have been here for a long time but
 
01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
um I think the two years is just that
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I frankly I think if we are able to
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
join the state health insurance I don't
 
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
think that we would ever leave the state
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
um it's just so that we don't sort of
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
Burden the state with getting on the
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
plan and then choosing next year to get
 
01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
off the plan and then going back on the
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
plan I think that they wanted some
 
01:59:52.609 --> 01:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
guarantee that if they're going to do
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
the administrative work to get us on the
 
01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
plan that it will be for at least two
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
years but like I said I I don't Envision
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
um you know us ever going back to
 
02:00:02.689 --> 02:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
Private health insurance if we're able
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
to join the state plan thank you
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative lackas thank you um so I
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
I looked at a fiscal note and I
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
understand why you know it's difficult
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
or impossible to come up with a precise
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh answer because there's you know
 
02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
variables you know size that who opts in
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
their characteristics and all that
 
02:00:23.159 --> 02:00:24.229 align:start position:0%
their characteristics and all that
however

02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:00:25.609 --> 02:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
I have a problem voting for something
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
where there's just no clue I mean there
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
should at least be possible to have a
 
02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:30.709 align:start position:0%
should at least be possible to have a
range

02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
range
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
of possible cost to this thing and I
 
02:00:35.689 --> 02:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
can't see how to vote for it without at
 
02:00:37.370 --> 02:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
least some idea
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
so somebody could provide that I don't
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
know if that's you or someone else it
 
02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
would be helpful I so I can I can't give
 
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
you the range right now I can certainly
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow up but I can speak to that issue
 
02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
a little bit as well um but we can
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
follow up with a range
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
um what I can tell you is um the health
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
care costs will certainly be cheaper for
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
the employee and it will be cheaper for
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire public defender the
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
only issue that could cause cost to
 
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
increase is that we do expect because
 
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
this is such an attractive benefit that
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
people who are currently not receiving
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
health insurance through the public
 
02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
defender so either through their they
 
02:01:11.689 --> 02:01:11.699 align:start position:0%
get it through their spouse or through
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
some other source might join our plan
 
02:01:14.159 --> 02:01:16.189 align:start position:0%
some other source might join our plan
because

02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
um because it's a better plan but I I
 
02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
can also tell you um you know one of the
 
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
reasons why it's hard to pin down a
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
number is because currently With Private
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
health insurance not only is nhpd
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
covering premiums we're also covering a
 
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
percentage of claims and so that we will
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
no longer have to do that under the
 
02:01:38.689 --> 02:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
state health insurance plan so the
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
increase in cost that we anticipate
 
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
potentially based on increased
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
utilization of our health plan will be
 
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
offset I don't think completely but will
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
be offset by the idea that we are no
 
02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:52.139 align:start position:0%
longer going to have to be paying a
 
02:01:55.729 --> 02:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
percentage of claims follow-up okay
 
02:01:55.739 --> 02:01:56.330 align:start position:0%
percentage of claims follow-up okay
um

02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
yeah it wasn't clear to me how things
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
currently work who's paying for the
 
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
health care and how this changes that so
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds from what you just said that
 
02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.149 align:start position:0%
it sounds from what you just said that
um

02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
that nhpd is already paying for at least
 
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
some portion of their health care how
 
02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
does it work now and how would that
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
change sure so as we're funded through
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
the general fund we are literally just
 
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
given a budget and then we have to use
 
02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
that budget to pay all of our expenses
 
02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:25.139 align:start position:0%
and so we use our budget to pay for
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
health care and we contract right now
 
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's through Cigna and through Cigna
 
02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
obviously we have premium costs we
 
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
actually nhpd covers I think it's around
 
02:02:39.649 --> 02:02:39.659 align:start position:0%
92 percent of the premium costs the
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
employee pays eight percent of the
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
premium cost and then the employee pays
 
02:02:46.370 --> 02:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
a percentage of the claims and we pay a
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of the claims nhpd plays a
 
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
percentage of the claims but all of this
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
because we're from the general fund one
 
02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
way or the other it's it's all paid
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
through through State funds um it's just
 
02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a line item in our
 
02:02:58.199 --> 02:02:59.330 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a line item in our
budget

02:02:59.330 --> 02:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
um that that we use our funds to cover
 
02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.270 align:start position:0%
um that that we use our funds to cover
follow-up

02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.050 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:08.030 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
I mean they're getting health insurance
 
02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
and HPD is paying for it sounds like
 
02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
probably for the bulk of it I don't know
 
02:03:16.609 --> 02:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
what percentage overall so how does that
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
how does the the cost and who pays what
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
part of it change If This Were to sure
 
02:03:22.679 --> 02:03:24.350 align:start position:0%
part of it change If This Were to sure
so

02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
um the premium costs are just lower
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
under the state so both to nhpd and to
 
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
the employee so the cost for say a
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
family plan is cheaper under both for
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
nhpd and for the employee so the health
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
care costs are actually lower for nhpd
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
under the state plan it's just the idea
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
that because it's an attractive benefit
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
we might see increased utilization
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
um but so we we currently pay like I
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
said the premium and then a percentage
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
of claims moving forward we're just
 
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
going to be paying premiums and another
 
02:03:59.570 --> 02:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
reason why it's hard to pin down a
 
02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
number is because you know there's if
 
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're able to join the plan then there's
 
02:04:06.109 --> 02:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
a period where you know we can negotiate
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
premiums and so we don't quite know
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what the premiums are going to
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.169 --> 02:04:14.179 align:start position:0%
um perhaps
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
if you could mention little details like
 
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
how many employees you have sure
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes so we have I think the count today
 
02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:24.830 align:start position:0%
yes so we have I think the count today
is

02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it's I think 251 or 252 employees
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Lancaster
 
02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay
 
02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:32.689 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay
um

02:04:32.689 --> 02:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
so from what you're saying
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
the savings both
 
02:04:37.139 --> 02:04:38.149 align:start position:0%
the savings both
um

02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
to the department which might be offset
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
by more people you know being involved
 
02:04:44.050 --> 02:04:44.060 align:start position:0%
in the plan and to the employees is is
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
because as I understand it the premiums
 
02:04:49.550 --> 02:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
are going to be less and you don't you
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the employee don't have to pay a
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the claims is I mean is it
 
02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
going to go down because you're joining
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
the other plan It's a larger group and
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
therefore they get better rates or
 
02:05:02.689 --> 02:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
um I think that's possible I I'm not
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
sure what you're saying then is is
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
self-insured they pay the state pays the
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
claims that's correct okay thank you
 
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay I have a a question online
 
02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:16.910 align:start position:0%
okay I have a a question online
um

02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
eight and nine it says the public
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
defender shall be permitted is that your
 
02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
organization or is it each individual
 
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
it's our organization yes
 
02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
yes we are not we're not going to engage
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
in yes we we will either be able to join
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
the state plan or we will have to stay
 
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
with private insurance
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that wasn't entirely
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
clear okay
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
and all right
 
02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
all right like and I'm I'm kind of
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
surprised that the premium is being
 
02:05:47.209 --> 02:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
lower unless you're a very high risk
 
02:05:47.219 --> 02:05:48.709 align:start position:0%
lower unless you're a very high risk
because

02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
I was on the state plan as a legislator
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
for a few years and it was
 
02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
although it covered a great deal it was
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
also a very pricey plan
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
and has that actually has actually
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
changed I mean comparatively to what
 
02:06:04.729 --> 02:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
we're able to get in the private Market
 
02:06:07.129 --> 02:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
it is considerably cheaper all right
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you that's interesting we we are
 
02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
relatively small organization so our
 
02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
bargaining power
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
um you know we're only about 250
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
employees and so when we go out and get
 
02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
a private contract we don't have a great
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
deal of bargaining power because we are
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
a small organization representative and
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
then Matt Gould
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
so I think that correct me if I'm wrong
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
the way I'm understanding this
 
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
that this bill would allow your your
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
group to join the
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
State Health state employee health plan
 
02:06:42.169 --> 02:06:42.179 align:start position:0%
and that it would reduce the cost of the
 
02:06:42.179 --> 02:06:43.310 align:start position:0%
and that it would reduce the cost of the
overall

02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
overall
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
health care for your employees because
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be paying the premium
 
02:06:51.169 --> 02:06:51.179 align:start position:0%
premium and you'd be paying a lower rate
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
correct I mean the the employee will
 
02:06:55.010 --> 02:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
still pay a percentage of the premium
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.970 --> 02:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
and then if you choose to
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
opt into this plan
 
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
your employees could choose to opt in
 
02:07:10.370 --> 02:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
themselves right they're not necessarily
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
are they will they be required to join
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
the health plan
 
02:07:17.209 --> 02:07:17.219 align:start position:0%
so or they can go out in the market and
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
get their own correct I mean we're we're
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
not going to offer both the state plan
 
02:07:23.149 --> 02:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
and a private option we're only going to
 
02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
offer the one option but correct they
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
could either get insurance through us or
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
through their spouse or you know on
 
02:07:31.129 --> 02:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
their own if I guess if they wanted to
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you and I believe if
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not correct if I'm not mistake
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
follow up excuse me I just want to that
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
the plan that the state employee plan
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
that state employees are on is less
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
expensive than the ones that we are
 
02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
they are less expensive than what the
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
public defender program is able to buy
 
02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
is a small group Market all right thank
 
02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:02.450 align:start position:0%
is a small group Market all right thank
you

02:08:02.450 --> 02:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
okay represent bold
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
well I would just add on to that what I
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh to what representative Grody just
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
said Madam chair
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
um what I had heard was that as a rep I
 
02:08:16.609 --> 02:08:16.619 align:start position:0%
can buy into the plan but I don't get
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
the state employee rate
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
that I have to pay the full right I
 
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
don't get some of the reimbursement
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
subsidies and so they will be getting
 
02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:26.089 align:start position:0%
subsidies and so they will be getting
that

02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:28.729 --> 02:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
um lower rate of the state employee that
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
we don't get as Representatives that may
 
02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
be why you noticed a difference
 
02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:35.810 align:start position:0%
be why you noticed a difference
that

02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
that that is correct and I can also
 
02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
point out um you know we are would not
 
02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
be the only non-governmental agency
 
02:08:46.609 --> 02:08:46.619 align:start position:0%
um on the state on the state plan
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
um they have a they have
 
02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
um a group called The statutorily
 
02:08:53.209 --> 02:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
authorized groups said they call us a
 
02:08:53.219 --> 02:08:54.050 align:start position:0%
authorized groups said they call us a
sag

02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
sag
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
um so yes there are other organizations
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
um that are on the state plan who are
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
not state employees
 
02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think that may be the
 
02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:04.750 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think that may be the
difference

02:09:04.750 --> 02:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
legislators as a representative Horrigan
 
02:09:11.330 --> 02:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes we
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
when I was um
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
yes I I never paid into the state
 
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
employee plan I when the Affordable Care
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
Act came in I found that was a better
 
02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
option but that's uh which is probably
 
02:09:21.179 --> 02:09:22.070 align:start position:0%
option but that's uh which is probably
not

02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
an option for your for employees and now
 
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
I want Medicare and you miss you to
 
02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
um signal plan some of my questions
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
first of all how was your overall cost
 
02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
of Labor like going up because there's
 
02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
you're trading off probably better
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
health insurance plan for the salary and
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
then also what do you
 
02:09:43.070 --> 02:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
what are you planning to offer your
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
employees should or is that still
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
subject negotiation for uh if you should
 
02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:48.410 align:start position:0%
subject negotiation for uh if you should
be

02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
if this bill should pass and the the
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
executives of the plan and all that so
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
like what what will their co-p be and
 
02:09:57.050 --> 02:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
what would you be paying so that is to
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
be determined
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
um but I think from what I've looked at
 
02:10:03.169 --> 02:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
it's it's a significant savings to both
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
staff and as I've said and to nhpd the
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
premium for us is cheaper as well
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
um but was there another question I can
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
answer I I apologize
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
they don't have the I guess just just
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
the way the ACA is uh structured they
 
02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
don't have the option of buying an ACA
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
plan instead of yours or do they they do
 
02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
not have the option to buy subsidized
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
02:10:38.209 --> 02:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
if I'm reading this correctly uh
 
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
apparently there's like 245 employees
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
right now in your agency and 201 are on
 
02:10:49.729 --> 02:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
the plan already so you're talking 40
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
some people give or take
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
that's that's the potential um and again
 
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
we I don't think we expect every single
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
one of those um you know some some
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
people are married to people who already
 
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
have state health insurance so we may be
 
02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
just talking 20 people correct something
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
like that correct okay yes
 
02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
chair just a quick clarification 252 is
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
fully stopped or what you have on staff
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
at the moment that's what we have on
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
snap at the moment what would fully
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
stuff look like
 
02:11:21.290 --> 02:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
you know I
 
02:11:23.209 --> 02:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
higher when we live when we lose people
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
so we are actually right now not bad I
 
02:11:28.129 --> 02:11:28.139 align:start position:0%
mean I think we would like to add
 
02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
um you know every every fall we get a
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
new group we're having 19 new lawyers
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
that are starting in the fall but we do
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
expect attrition between now and then
 
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
um so usually you know it kind of plays
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
out around we like to be around between
 
02:11:46.970 --> 02:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
250 and 260 employees thank you other
 
02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:48.770 align:start position:0%
250 and 260 employees thank you other
questions

02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you
 
02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's the microphone on yes yes I am my
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
name is Gregory close to it you have to
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
my name is Greg Erskine I am a
 
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home father of four and resident
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
of Manchester I'd like to thank this
 
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
house committee for allowing me time to
 
02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:23.149 align:start position:0%
house committee for allowing me time to
speak

02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:12:25.250 --> 02:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
a couple of months ago my wife Heather
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
and I moved here from Kentucky where we
 
02:12:29.330 --> 02:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
lived for the last eight years we had
 
02:12:31.729 --> 02:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
moved there because my wife was hired by
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Louisville Office of the public
 
02:12:34.850 --> 02:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
defender and we've just moved to
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester because she was hired by the
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public defender so SB 108
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
is a bill that would impact our family
 
02:12:40.199 --> 02:12:41.390 align:start position:0%
is a bill that would impact our family
greatly

02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
greatly
 
02:12:43.490 --> 02:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we decided to
 
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
uproot our lives and move to New
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was because New Hampshire's
 
02:12:50.330 --> 02:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
office seemed more efficiently run than
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
Louisville's was so this bill which is
 
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
likely to give the public defenders A
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Better Health Plan is exactly the kind
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
of lure that would bring in the best and
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
brightest from all over the country but
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
the other reason that we wanted to move
 
02:13:05.089 --> 02:13:05.099 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire is that it is my home I
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
was born in Concord Hospital I was
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
raised in Manchester I was educated in
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
Manchester's Public Schools my parents
 
02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
were likewise lifelong residents of
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
Manchester as were my four grandparents
 
02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
and I am Overjoyed to be back in my
 
02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
beloved home state and I am happy that
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
my wife's work can serve the state that
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
I love so deeply and I feel
 
02:13:27.169 --> 02:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily blessed to be able to
 
02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
raise our kids here
 
02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
we do our best to keep our kids healthy
 
02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
with regular checkups and good food and
 
02:13:35.569 --> 02:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
running around in fresh air but one
 
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
can't always prepare for every
 
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:38.270 align:start position:0%
can't always prepare for every
eventuality

02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
eventuality
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
last summer our five-year-olds
 
02:13:43.010 --> 02:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
complained that her back was sore we
 
02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
asked the doctor about it she said it
 
02:13:46.609 --> 02:13:46.619 align:start position:0%
was likely nothing major just keep an
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
eye on it and the problem continued to
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
worsen eventually X-rays showed severe
 
02:13:54.770 --> 02:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
damage to her lower spine
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
no one knew why the spinal surgeon who
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
examined her said he'd never seen
 
02:14:00.530 --> 02:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
anything like this
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
so the doctors ran tests scans biopsies
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
I spent many nights with my little
 
02:14:08.209 --> 02:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
kindergartner in the hospital
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
eventually it was determined that it was
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
a bacterial infection which could be
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
treated with antibiotics although the
 
02:14:16.250 --> 02:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
damage to her spine remains
 
02:14:18.290 --> 02:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
this experience brought home to me that
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
there are some severe illnesses that you
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
can't prevent or prepare for they befall
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
us and we can only hope that there are
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
medical professionals that can help and
 
02:14:29.569 --> 02:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
that your insurance out of pocket
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
maximum doesn't ruin a person
 
02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:33.169 align:start position:0%
maximum doesn't ruin a person
financially

02:14:33.169 --> 02:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
financially
 
02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
if SB 108 passes the switch from nhpd's
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
current Insurance to the state Employee
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
Program could save a family like ours
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars in the event of an
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
unforeseen medical emergency such as the
 
02:14:47.149 --> 02:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
one that we experienced
 
02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
we moved here because my wife's job
 
02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
allows her to serve the most vulnerable
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
SB 108 is legislation that will help
 
02:14:58.010 --> 02:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
working families who are here to make
 
02:14:59.450 --> 02:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a better place for
 
02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:00.290 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a better place for
everyone

02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:00.300 align:start position:0%

um Sarah spoke about each year we have

an incoming class and I'm one of the
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
people that's responsible for training
 
02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
them on how to be a trial lawyer
 
02:16:26.330 --> 02:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh my husband uh actually also works for
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Public Defenders as a
 
02:16:29.689 --> 02:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
staff attorney he has been with the
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
program for nine years
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh I also have permission to speak on
 
02:16:36.169 --> 02:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
behalf of two other individuals who
 
02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
could not be here uh Sarah and Cherry
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
who has been an investigator with the
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
program for 15 years now uh and Kara
 
02:16:46.310 --> 02:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
samard who was with the program for nine
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
years before she left in December due in
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
part to our health care plan both of
 
02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
those individuals did submit written
 
02:16:55.730 --> 02:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
testimony and I do hope that you have
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to read that testimony
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
because I will reference it but I cannot
 
02:17:02.929 --> 02:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
speak as eloquently as they can about
 
02:17:06.650 --> 02:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
um the one well one of the things that
 
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
the three of us have in common is that
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
we all three had children while employed
 
02:17:14.690 --> 02:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
at nhpd
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
for me that happened in December of 2021
 
02:17:20.929 --> 02:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
when we welcomed my daughter a catalea
 
02:17:20.939 --> 02:17:22.669 align:start position:0%
when we welcomed my daughter a catalea
Eva

02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
Eva
 
02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
um I've always known that we've had a
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
high deductible when I first started it
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
was much better everything was covered
 
02:17:30.650 --> 02:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
we didn't pay as much I didn't use it uh
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so uh when I had my daughter was
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
really the first time I had to use our
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
um and as Fortune would have it because
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the pregnancy the way you know the
 
02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
time frame of the pregnancy I got to use
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
it twice because I was I spanned to plan
 
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
years so I paid a thousand dollars for a
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
relatively easy pregnancy and then
 
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
because I did have an emergency
 
02:17:55.730 --> 02:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
C-section I paid
 
02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:56.750 align:start position:0%
C-section I paid
um

02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
I maxed out our deductible and our
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket Max and had to pay five
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for that on top of that
 
02:18:07.370 --> 02:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
when I got home from the hospital
 
02:18:09.650 --> 02:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
um you know you're in the hospital the
 
02:18:10.969 --> 02:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
doctors are telling you your baby needs
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
this you're of course saying yes of
 
02:18:13.849 --> 02:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
course it's in network hospitals in
 
02:18:13.859 --> 02:18:15.589 align:start position:0%
course it's in network hospitals in
Portsmouth

02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and lo and behold Apparently one of
 
02:18:20.450 --> 02:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
those providers was at a network and so
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
Cigna was refusing to cover it and so on
 
02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
top of being home having to deal with
 
02:18:27.650 --> 02:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
postpartum and a new baby I also had to
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
be fighting with the health insurance
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
who were trying to not uh pay for
 
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.509 --> 02:18:38.519 align:start position:0%
you know this is my experience
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
um and and why I why I think it's
 
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
important to share and what I think is
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
important for for all of you to to know
 
02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:46.250 align:start position:0%
important for for all of you to to know
um

02:18:46.250 --> 02:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
you know well in terms of my Five-Year
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
Plan I certainly want to have another
 
02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:53.389 align:start position:0%
Plan I certainly want to have another
child

02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:18:57.049 --> 02:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
um I need to think about whether it
 
02:19:00.410 --> 02:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
makes sense for me to knowingly have to
 
02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
pay another five thousand dollars to
 
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
have another child to stay at a job that
 
02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
I that I love I mean even now you know I
 
02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:10.019 align:start position:0%
and I hate to admit this but when my
 
02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
daughter comes home from daycare and she
 
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
has a cold you know I need to think to
 
02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
myself is is it really worthwhile to go
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
to the doctor
 
02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
um with our really high uh cost you know
 
02:19:22.009 --> 02:19:22.019 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred to two hundred dollars
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
each time I have to take her to the
 
02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
hospital or to the doctor not the
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
hospital but
 
02:19:28.849 --> 02:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
um and so it's something I I have to
 
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:31.019 align:start position:0%
think about and I hate
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
that I have to think about it and when
 
02:19:36.169 --> 02:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
you look at the stability of the program
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
what we really need in terms of
 
02:19:40.129 --> 02:19:40.139 align:start position:0%
retaining lawyers is we really need
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
lawyers in the three to five five to
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
eight year range the this is the core of
 
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
the program the reason for that is
 
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
because at that point they have a full
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
case load they don't need as much
 
02:19:52.490 --> 02:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
supervision as they needed before and
 
02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
they're starting to Mentor new lawyers
 
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
um either formally through our mentoring
 
02:19:59.450 --> 02:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
program or informally as just you know
 
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes a new lawyer doesn't want to
 
02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
ask someone with 11 years experience a
 
02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
question they feel more comfortable
 
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
going to someone with three years
 
02:20:09.290 --> 02:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
um and so it's really important to have
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
those lawyers in the office and when we
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
don't we send out these new lawyers we
 
02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
get a new shiny you know new class I I
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
love interacting with them they are so
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
excited to start working at the program
 
02:20:24.889 --> 02:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
and it's a great program but we send
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
them to these to their offices and they
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the support that they need
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
because there aren't these more
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
experienced lawyers there and they're
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
getting cases that they can they just
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
cannot handle and that they wouldn't be
 
02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
getting if we had those lawyers in the
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
three to five five to eight year range
 
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
and so they leave as well
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
these would be people that we wouldn't
 
02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
be losing if we could retain the lawyers
 
02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
and the three to five five to eight year
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
range these same lawyers who are
 
02:20:51.550 --> 02:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
probably thinking about having a family
 
02:20:53.929 --> 02:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
and they're thinking about whether it's
 
02:20:55.849 --> 02:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to spend five thousand
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
dollars to have at least to have
 
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
um a family
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
the other thing that all three of us
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
have in common is how hard our jobs are
 
02:21:07.370 --> 02:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
our hearts are our jobs are really
 
02:21:10.849 --> 02:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
really hard not just the secondary PTSD
 
02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
um that Sarah talks very eloquently
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
about and so does Cara but also just the
 
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
emotional toll of our cases
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
when I go to trial sometimes I'll wear a
 
02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
fitness watch and my fitness watch will
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
tell me that I have run a marathon
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
because my heart is racing my anxiety
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sleeping I'm not eating
 
02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what's required because I
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
have to care about my clients in order
 
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
to do the job that I
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
am hired to do and that I love doing but
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's really hard to do and it's really
 
02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
hard to do when I don't have access to
 
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
mental health care I don't see a
 
02:21:49.250 --> 02:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
therapist my husband does not go to
 
02:21:49.260 --> 02:21:51.950 align:start position:0%
therapist my husband does not go to
therapy

02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
because again if I'm making a decision
 
02:21:56.690 --> 02:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
of taking my daughter to the doctor
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
because it would cost a hundred dollars
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
or two hundred dollars
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to make the decision to go
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
to therapy when it would cost 60 to 100
 
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
for me to attend a session
 
02:22:09.469 --> 02:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
and you see that in all the lawyers and
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
a lot of the lawyers who have been there
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
as long as I have
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
um they're not receiving the mental
 
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
health treatment that they need
 
02:22:17.809 --> 02:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:17.819 --> 02:22:19.190 align:start position:0%
thank you
sorry

02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
um it's also really important in terms
 
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
of recruiting new lawyers
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
um Kara talks a lot about this she
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
actually works as a clinical professor
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
at UNH she is basically training our
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
incoming class before they even get to
 
02:22:33.889 --> 02:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
us and she has seen that there's a
 
02:22:37.130 --> 02:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
movement in the universities towards the
 
02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
well-being of lawyers of making sure
 
02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
that they have access to mental health
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
care and so you see the incoming class
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
expecting that care expecting that
 
02:22:47.450 --> 02:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to attend
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
therapy and they ask me about it when
 
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing new lawyer training and I
 
02:22:54.410 --> 02:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
have to be honest with them and I have
 
02:22:56.330 --> 02:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
to say to them you're probably not going
 
02:22:57.889 --> 02:22:57.899 align:start position:0%
to be able to afford to go to a
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
therapist on your salary I I can't
 
02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
afford it on my salary
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and that's really hard for them to
 
02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
hear and if there are other programs or
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
other jobs that are offering that we are
 
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
going to lose lawyers that are the best
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the brightest because of that
 
02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
um she wasn't able to submit it prior
 
02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
but we I also got a letter from Eva
 
02:23:22.429 --> 02:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
farakkas who is a new lawyer she just
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
started in the national office who
 
02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
writes about that who writes that she
 
02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
saw the benefits packet and thought
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
about not coming to nhpd because of it
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
but decided that she was going to make
 
02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
it make do but she was attending therapy
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
and is no longer and at times has had to
 
02:23:42.889 --> 02:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
go to the doctor and hasn't because she
 
02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:46.969 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:23:46.969 --> 02:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
inflammation I do think putting us on
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
this bill will help us retain and
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
recruit lawyers that is how we can lower
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
our caseloads that's how we can lower
 
02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
overall costs as Sarah said it takes a
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
lot of time effort and money resources
 
02:24:04.250 --> 02:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
to train a new lawyer if I leave the
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
program you can't just hire someone to
 
02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
replace me they can't take my caseload
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to take years before they can
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
take the cases that I have
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and we're not going to be able to
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
recruit some of the best and brightest
 
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
who will Who will stay and who will want
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
to make this program as good as it is
 
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
and again it is a great program and it
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
is you know we're such a small state and
 
02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
we have such a great public defenders
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I just want to stay to make it
 
02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:32.750 align:start position:0%
and I just want to stay to make it
better

02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
good morning I don't generally have a
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
problem with my volume so let me know if
 
02:24:59.330 --> 02:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong about that
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
I've worked at a staff attorney at the
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public defender for almost
 
02:25:05.090 --> 02:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
seven years now
 
02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
during that time I've seen turnover
 
02:25:09.889 --> 02:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
at first
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
at a normal rate something you can
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
expect something that's in every kind of
 
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh job market but then as the years went
 
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
on the pandemic complicated the judicial
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
system stalled the courts and strategic
 
02:25:26.330 --> 02:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
choices were made caseloads skyrocketed
 
02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
um and I mean that I was over two and a
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
half times my expected caseload
 
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
mental health plummeted as a result and
 
02:25:35.929 --> 02:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
job satisfaction faltered and
 
02:25:35.939 --> 02:25:37.969 align:start position:0%
job satisfaction faltered and
deteriorated

02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
deteriorated
 
02:25:39.889 --> 02:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
we've lost far more than a third of our
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
attorneys in this short amount of time
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
and not just attorneys or bodies to take
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
cases but the institutional knowledge
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
that goes with them
 
02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
the ability to train the new class to
 
02:25:54.610 --> 02:25:54.620 align:start position:0%
Mentor them to keep them on
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
at my seven year mark I am currently
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
mentoring two new attorneys that is
 
02:26:04.730 --> 02:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
strange it is uncommon and it is a huge
 
02:26:06.410 --> 02:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
time commitment
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh I am responsible for my caseload but
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
also theirs their appearances in court
 
02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
their clients and why do I have to
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
because there's no one else to do it
 
02:26:18.349 --> 02:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
we have no mid-level attorneys that have
 
02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
the experience
 
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
the time the mental energy to do this
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
the more we fail at retention keeping
 
02:26:29.330 --> 02:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
people in my experience level in
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
eliana's experience level the more
 
02:26:33.889 --> 02:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
caseloads will rise and the more people
 
02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
that will leave because the job is just
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
that hard
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
it feels like a never-ending cycle
 
02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
but we're at least starting we have a
 
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
glimmer of hope to change that cycle
 
02:26:49.730 --> 02:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
many attorneys and staff members have
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
written stories or come to me about
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
their current experience with our health
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
insurance and what it would mean to be
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
on the state health insurance plan
 
02:26:59.809 --> 02:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
they've talked about the harm our
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
insurance has caused them and their
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
families and the promise this bill
 
02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
offers and I want to Echo that while
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
caseloads are a really big concern and
 
02:27:10.969 --> 02:27:10.979 align:start position:0%
salaries are also a really big concern
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
health insurance is part of the entire
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
compensation package
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
salaries take into account other
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
benefits and people can live with less
 
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
if they receive the health care that
 
02:27:23.929 --> 02:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
they need
 
02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
the first story I want to talk about is
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
from a staff attorney that left New
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender last year
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
she left in very large part due to the
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
complications from our health insurance
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
the beginning of her affordability
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
issues with the public defender's office
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
began toward the end of her first year
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
of employment when she tried to enroll
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
in therapy at the time she says it was
 
02:27:46.969 --> 02:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
partially because I needed it and
 
02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
partially a preventative measure because
 
02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
she knew how hard the job could be
 
02:27:52.490 --> 02:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
she wanted to make sure she had the help
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
in place for when she needed it and her
 
02:27:56.330 --> 02:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
case so it got more serious
 
02:27:58.610 --> 02:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
therapy visits cost her eighty dollars
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
per visit
 
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
even with an in-network provider
 
02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
with a beginning salary on the New
 
02:28:05.929 --> 02:28:05.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender salary scale
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
she could only afford one visit per
 
02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
she could only afford one visit per
month

02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:28:11.150 --> 02:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
she made the choice against her doctor's
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation to only go once per month
 
02:28:15.530 --> 02:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
because that's what she could afford
 
02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
on the state plan she could have
 
02:28:19.849 --> 02:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
afforded weekly visits and the monthly
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
costs would have still been lower than
 
02:28:24.410 --> 02:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
her one session
 
02:28:26.290 --> 02:28:26.300 align:start position:0%
in her second year she had an emergency
 
02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
hospitalization that caused her to hit
 
02:28:30.889 --> 02:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
her deductible all at once resulting in
 
02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar thousands of dollars of
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
bills she could not afford to pay
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
she was living paycheck to paycheck as
 
02:28:37.610 --> 02:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
an attorney with the New Hampshire
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
public defender and this put her over
 
02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
her budget
 
02:28:43.969 --> 02:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
she was lucky that she had a family that
 
02:28:45.770 --> 02:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
could help but she talks about the
 
02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
embarrassment of having to go to them
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
for help
 
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
she was the first generation that had
 
02:28:53.929 --> 02:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
professional degrees and she couldn't
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
even support herself or get basic
 
02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.849 --> 02:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
she knew when she went to them she was
 
02:29:03.889 --> 02:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
going to have to defend her decision to
 
02:29:05.210 --> 02:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
work as a public defender in New
 
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to them
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
under the state health insurance plan
 
02:29:15.170 --> 02:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
she says that her deductible would have
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
been low enough that she could have
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
afforded the emergency hospitalization
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
when she returned to work the stress
 
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
from both the job the time off and the
 
02:29:25.849 --> 02:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
added bills compounded the already
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
stressful work
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it solidified her decision to leave
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
and seek other employment she could no
 
02:29:33.170 --> 02:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
longer afford her job at the public
 
02:29:33.180 --> 02:29:35.690 align:start position:0%
longer afford her job at the public
defender

02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.849 --> 02:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
the second letter or story I brought to
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
talk to you about is from someone who is
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
still at the New Hampshire public
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
defender but her ability to stay at the
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
public defender is directly tied to the
 
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
bill before you
 
02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
she's been at the public defender for
 
02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
five years her co-worker she says are
 
02:29:53.389 --> 02:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
like her family and it's what kept her
 
02:29:53.399 --> 02:29:54.349 align:start position:0%
like her family and it's what kept her
here

02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
but in summer of 2022 she couldn't put
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
off medical appointments any longer she
 
02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
had heart issues that she could no
 
02:30:04.429 --> 02:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
longer ignore her cardiologist and
 
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
gastroenterologist requested multiple
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
procedures in testing in order to get
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
her a diagnosis
 
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
our health insurance denied the
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
procedures her doctors deemed were
 
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
necessary they found a mass in her
 
02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:18.349 align:start position:0%
necessary they found a mass in her
stomach

02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
stomach
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
but Cigna would not pay for the more
 
02:30:23.809 --> 02:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
precise diagnostic test to determine its
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
nature because quote there was no proof
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
that mass would grow in the next 12
 
02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:29.450 align:start position:0%
that mass would grow in the next 12
months

02:30:29.450 --> 02:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:30:31.849 --> 02:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
not having a definitive answer has led
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
this co-worker to take more leave more
 
02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
sick days and has impacted her ability
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
to do the job
 
02:30:40.969 --> 02:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
it has put a burden on her her
 
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
co-workers and the rest of the employees
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
and she has the added stress of not
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
knowing what's going on with her own
 
02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:48.170 align:start position:0%
knowing what's going on with her own
health

02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:30:50.270 --> 02:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
based on this alone she says it's
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
difficult to stay in the job and to not
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
look for a better
 
02:30:57.710 --> 02:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
I have seen multiple lawyers in my time
 
02:31:01.849 --> 02:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
here leave because of the benefits
 
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
package or at least a component being
 
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
the benefits package
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
the mental health care that is necessary
 
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
to do this job appropriately and not
 
02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
burn out and be able to stay at this job
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
is is high it requires us actively
 
02:31:18.410 --> 02:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
seeking those those services that are
 
02:31:20.570 --> 02:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
financially kind of Out Of Reach from
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
what we're able to pay
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
I fear new lawyers who start and
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
encounter a similar experience as those
 
02:31:28.370 --> 02:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
I've talked about may be discouraged
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
from remaining here long term from
 
02:31:32.090 --> 02:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
choosing to have children like Ellie
 
02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
Eliana has said or from not receiving
 
02:31:36.650 --> 02:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
the medical care they need to be able to
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
stay in the job at all
 
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
the bill before the committee can make a
 
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful difference
 
02:31:43.490 --> 02:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
it can stop the hemorrhaging of
 
02:31:44.990 --> 02:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
Attorneys at the New Hampshire Public
 
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.130 align:start position:0%
Attorneys at the New Hampshire Public
Defender

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
Defender
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
and keep attorneys support staff and be
 
02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
a real benefit in recruitment
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
it can make us competitive with other
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
state agencies and other public defender
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that are taking our our staff
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we have trained and that we cannot
 
02:32:00.770 --> 02:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
keep within the state
 
02:32:02.929 --> 02:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
I'd ask you to consider these stories
 
02:32:04.610 --> 02:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
and others that you will hear and I
 
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
really thank you for your time
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if my question is
 
02:32:17.450 --> 02:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
not appropriate please let me know
 
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
um would you you were talking about
 
02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
deductibles how much is a family plan or
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
a single plan that you pay now I don't
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
know the answer I'm not on our health
 
02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:30.349 align:start position:0%
know the answer I'm not on our health
insurance

02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.359 --> 02:32:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
very good representative Orion do you
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a question yes when
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
when the attorneys leave the public
 
02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
defender office where do they typically
 
02:32:43.730 --> 02:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
typically go to a private
 
02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
Financial eternity form or a different
 
02:32:48.410 --> 02:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
area of law where are they going then I
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
think it depends
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%

02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:49.429 align:start position:0%

02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
record I'm Cindy Rosenwald I represent
 
02:34:45.170 --> 02:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
Senate District 13 which is most of
 
02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:46.490 align:start position:0%
Senate District 13 which is most of
Nashua

02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm pleased to introduce Senate bill
 
02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
105. this bill grew out of a study
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee last summer and fall and
 
02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
um the house co-sponsors were members of
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee with me
 
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.429 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee with me
so

02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:04.439 --> 02:35:04.990 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:35:04.990 --> 02:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
when a woman gives birth in New
 
02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the division of Vital Records
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
which is located in the Secretary of
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
State's office collects information
 
02:35:20.929 --> 02:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
needed to issue a birth certificate
 
02:35:26.270 --> 02:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
however the form the off the mother is
 
02:35:28.429 --> 02:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
required to fill out for the birth
 
02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
certificate also forces her to divulge
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
some very personal information
 
02:35:40.429 --> 02:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State such as how
 
02:35:42.650 --> 02:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
much she smoked while she was pregnant
 
02:35:47.450 --> 02:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
how much alcohol she drank and even how
 
02:35:50.690 --> 02:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
much she weighed before she got pregnant
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
and the form tells her it's a felony to
 
02:35:58.929 --> 02:35:58.939 align:start position:0%
lie about any of this I've given you all
 
02:36:03.889 --> 02:36:03.899 align:start position:0%
a copy of this form
 
02:36:03.899 --> 02:36:04.969 align:start position:0%
a copy of this form
um

02:36:04.969 --> 02:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:07.969 --> 02:36:07.979 align:start position:0%
Vital Records doesn't want it to be made
 
02:36:11.210 --> 02:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
public but I've highlighted some of the
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
questions mothers are asked to answer
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
and I've also highlighted the felony
 
02:36:22.849 --> 02:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
warning for lying which occurs most of
 
02:36:24.290 --> 02:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
the way down
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
the page on the mother's worksheet for
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate
 
02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:31.010 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate
so

02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:35.150 --> 02:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
you are forced to divulge
 
02:36:38.570 --> 02:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
your personal habits and some of your
 
02:36:42.650 --> 02:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
medical history under threat of criminal
 
02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:44.950 align:start position:0%
medical history under threat of criminal
penalties

02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
02:36:49.330 --> 02:36:49.340 align:start position:0%
as if this is not intrusive enough
 
02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
sometime after the mother goes home
 
02:36:57.170 --> 02:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
the hospital or birthing center sends
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
out more identifiable confidential
 
02:37:04.490 --> 02:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
health information from the mother and
 
02:37:07.250 --> 02:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
her baby's medical records to the
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records without her
 
02:37:13.250 --> 02:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
permission and most likely without even
 
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
telling her this information includes
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
when was her last period does she have a
 
02:37:23.570 --> 02:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted disease is she
 
02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding even a little bit did she
 
02:37:29.809 --> 02:37:29.819 align:start position:0%
have fertility treatments was it a
 
02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
vaginal birth
 
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
and many other personal questions about
 
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
her medical and social history again
 
02:37:39.849 --> 02:37:39.859 align:start position:0%
I've highlighted some of this personal
 
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
identifiable information taken from her
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
and her baby's medical records and sent
 
02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State and the
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
Centers for Disease Control
 
02:37:56.330 --> 02:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
and that those questions are on the
 
02:37:59.690 --> 02:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
facility worksheet that follows the
 
02:38:01.849 --> 02:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
mother's worksheet
 
02:38:05.650 --> 02:38:05.660 align:start position:0%
state law in the
 
02:38:10.370 --> 02:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
332-i has long made clear that the
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
information in someone's medical records
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
belongs to that person
 
02:38:20.050 --> 02:38:20.060 align:start position:0%
the provider owns the physical record
 
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
but the individual owns what's in it and
 
02:38:27.889 --> 02:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
it the sentence could not be more clear
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
and it's long time stay long so let me
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the information in
 
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
someone's medical records belongs to
 
02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
them not the hospital
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
not any doctor
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
and not the government
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
furthermore a few years back five years
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
ago more than 80 percent of Voters
 
02:38:54.190 --> 02:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
amended the New Hampshire Constitution
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
to include a statement that granted
 
02:39:00.050 --> 02:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
Staters have
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
the right quote to be free from
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
personal information end quote
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
providers that release a patient's
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
medical information not for the HIPAA
 
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
purposes of treatment payment or
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
Essential Health Care operations without
 
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
that person's consent or violating 332 I
 
02:39:28.849 --> 02:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
and I believe they are also violating
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:42.650 --> 02:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
we should I think be further concerned
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
about the invasion of privacy and the
 
02:39:48.250 --> 02:39:48.260 align:start position:0%
security of this medical information
 
02:39:50.510 --> 02:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
released to the division of Vital
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
Records because the Secretary of State's
 
02:39:57.290 --> 02:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
office is not covered by yahepa I don't
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
have any concerns about their internal
 
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
management controls at all however any
 
02:40:09.770 --> 02:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
hacking or breach of their systems would
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
not be subject to the investigative
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement or penalties in HIPAA the
 
02:40:18.889 --> 02:40:18.899 align:start position:0%
individual whose confidential medical
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
information was wrongly accessed would
 
02:40:25.270 --> 02:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
have no protection at all
 
02:40:29.690 --> 02:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
and the what I think is an unauthorized
 
02:40:31.849 --> 02:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
clearly unauthorized disclosure of
 
02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
individuals medical history is not
 
02:40:36.650 --> 02:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
limited to state government
 
02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
for two years during the study committee
 
02:40:42.290 --> 02:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
and through the Senate phase of work on
 
02:40:44.929 --> 02:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
this bill both the division of Vital
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
Records and the division of Public
 
02:40:49.610 --> 02:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
Health in the Department of Health and
 
02:40:52.690 --> 02:40:52.700 align:start position:0%
Human Services told us that only
 
02:40:56.809 --> 02:40:56.819 align:start position:0%
de-identified information on Mothers is
 
02:40:59.570 --> 02:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
sent to the National Center for Health
 
02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
statistics which is part of the CDC
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
um that is not the case
 
02:41:10.849 --> 02:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
all of this identifiable health
 
02:41:14.330 --> 02:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
information is sent to the federal
 
02:41:17.929 --> 02:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
government omitting only her name
 
02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
her address her date of birth her place
 
02:41:25.969 --> 02:41:25.979 align:start position:0%
of birth among other identifiers is sent
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
to the federal government making it very
 
02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
simple to identify individual women and
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
tie that to their Mana Court histories
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
I have read the cdc's instruction manual
 
02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
for hospitals on how to fill out the
 
02:41:45.889 --> 02:41:45.899 align:start position:0%
birth worksheets to send the federal
 
02:41:49.309 --> 02:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
government four times I didn't give it
 
02:41:52.969 --> 02:41:52.979 align:start position:0%
to you but it's incredibly detailed it
 
02:41:56.330 --> 02:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
has eight different ways diabetes has to
 
02:41:58.929 --> 02:41:58.939 align:start position:0%
be reported and nine different
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
classifications for reporting
 
02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.990 align:start position:0%
classifications for reporting
hypertension

02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
hypertension
 
02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
for artificial insemination it requires
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals to report whether the sperm is
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
from the husband or a donor and remember
 
02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is identified information with the
 
02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:18.170 align:start position:0%
this is identified information with the
mothers

02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
mothers
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
all of her identity except her name
 
02:42:25.730 --> 02:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
um but nowhere in its 59 pages
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
does it require that identifying
 
02:42:31.849 --> 02:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
information on women who give birth be
 
02:42:35.570 --> 02:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the CDC but yet we send it
 
02:42:37.730 --> 02:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
for about 25
 
02:42:39.910 --> 02:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
000 mothers and babies in New Hampshire
 
02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:42:46.250 --> 02:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
now I would like to ask the men on this
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee to imagine for a moment what
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
if you had let's say erectile
 
02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
dysfunction or perhaps an enlarged
 
02:43:00.050 --> 02:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
prostate causing frequent urination or
 
02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
you like to have a few drinks or maybe
 
02:43:05.210 --> 02:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
you're somewhat overweight
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
and this information with your identity
 
02:43:11.270 --> 02:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
attached is was disclosed to the
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records and the
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
federal government without your
 
02:43:19.010 --> 02:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
permission or even your knowledge
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
and then in the impossible event of a
 
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
breach there were not even the
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
protections of HIPAA I don't think you
 
02:43:29.150 --> 02:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
would find this acceptable but that's
 
02:43:31.429 --> 02:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
the situation the women of New Hampshire
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
are in
 
02:43:37.309 --> 02:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
so Senate Bill 105 aims to rectify this
 
02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
situation in two ways one it
 
02:43:44.330 --> 02:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
decriminalizes the mother's worksheet
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
that she has to fill out and remember
 
02:43:48.770 --> 02:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
you fill it out you're not in the
 
02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
hospital for a very long a day or two
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
you've just had a baby maybe you're
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
tired maybe you're overwhelmed maybe
 
02:43:58.610 --> 02:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
you're more interested in your baby so
 
02:44:01.929 --> 02:44:01.939 align:start position:0%
it decriminalizes that information
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
should you decide not to report what you
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
weighed before you were pregnant and it
 
02:44:12.530 --> 02:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
de-identifies the information the
 
02:44:15.410 --> 02:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
hospitals released to the Secretary of
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
State the division of Vital Records
 
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
which is also released to the CDC
 
02:44:24.830 --> 02:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 105 recognizes the
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
importance of de-identified data that
 
02:44:31.849 --> 02:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
DHHS and doctors who do research use to
 
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
understand maternal and child health in
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they will still have
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
access to all the categories of
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
information they currently get how many
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
women have cesarean sections have
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
fertility treatments have gestational
 
02:44:50.929 --> 02:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
diabetes or other complications use
 
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
drugs the number of babies born with
 
02:44:56.330 --> 02:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
exposure to substances that have to be
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
reported to dcyf they just won't have
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
identifying information along with those
 
02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
records and let me reinforce also that
 
02:45:10.730 --> 02:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
all this Health Data will still be sent
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the CDC they just won't get the
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
identities of New Hampshire's mothers
 
02:45:20.090 --> 02:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
and babies involved now you'll be
 
02:45:21.889 --> 02:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
hearing from the Department of Health
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and some doctors and
 
02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
Clinics they're all behind me there's a
 
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
large group this morning that they're
 
02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
worried about losing Federal money and
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
the impact this might have on public
 
02:45:39.770 --> 02:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
health programs I recognize the
 
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
importance of federal grants
 
02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
as for the threat of losing federal
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
grants I have been here long enough to
 
02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
remember a long and drawn out debate on
 
02:45:54.290 --> 02:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
the house floor about all the federal
 
02:45:57.050 --> 02:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
money we were told we would lose if we
 
02:46:01.250 --> 02:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
did not pass a mandatory seat belt
 
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
needless to say you know we didn't pass
 
02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
it and we have never lost those federal
 
02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:07.910 align:start position:0%
it and we have never lost those federal
funds

02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
I personally worry that the department
 
02:46:14.690 --> 02:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
and some doctors are more concerned
 
02:46:17.690 --> 02:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
about the loss of money and their own
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
work than they are about invading the
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
privacy of women and babies and taking
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:29.929 --> 02:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee we must
 
02:46:34.969 --> 02:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
remember that someone's medical
 
02:46:34.979 --> 02:46:36.130 align:start position:0%
remember that someone's medical
information

02:46:36.130 --> 02:46:36.140 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
belongs to them not the hospital
 
02:46:43.969 --> 02:46:43.979 align:start position:0%
not the doctor and not the state of New
 
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and certainly not the federal
 
02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:47.570 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and certainly not the federal
government

02:46:47.570 --> 02:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:46:50.690 --> 02:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
in the end it is their constitutional
 
02:46:53.389 --> 02:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
right to be free from governmental
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
intrusion in their private or personal
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
information and is also their legal
 
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
right because under New Hampshire law
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
their medical history belongs only to
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
them thank you and be happy to answer
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator I'm sure
 
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
there'll be some yes representative
 
02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:13.969 align:start position:0%
there'll be some yes representative

02:47:13.969 --> 02:47:13.979 align:start position:0%
Lucas
 
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:47:17.450 --> 02:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and welcome thank you so as a
 
02:47:19.849 --> 02:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this I certainly supported
 
02:47:21.889 --> 02:47:21.899 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced what I'm
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can uh Enlighten us is
 
02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:24.590 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can uh Enlighten us is
to

02:47:24.590 --> 02:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:47:28.849 --> 02:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
why the Senate amended it as it did
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.410 align:start position:0%
 
agenda

02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:36.420 --> 02:47:39.650 align:start position:0%
 
allowed

02:47:39.650 --> 02:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.809 --> 02:47:43.819 align:start position:0%
the mother to
 
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
refuse consent for her
 
02:47:51.050 --> 02:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
medical information to be disclosed to
 
02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
the division of Vital Records
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and based on testimony we heard from
 
02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
02:48:03.950 --> 02:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
that they thought it was very important
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
to get a complete set of Statistics we
 
02:48:10.490 --> 02:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
amended it so that all this information
 
02:48:14.690 --> 02:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
is still has to be reported to the
 
02:48:19.309 --> 02:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
division of vital record for use by DHHS
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
and researchers and doctors around the
 
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
state but it will be de-identified so it
 
02:48:28.809 --> 02:48:28.819 align:start position:0%
really won't be personal to a particular
 
02:48:32.809 --> 02:48:32.819 align:start position:0%
individual great thank you
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you

chairman
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
while I admire your efforts to keep
 
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
medical information private I was
 
02:48:41.929 --> 02:48:41.939 align:start position:0%
looking at an old NH New Hampshire
 
02:48:43.730 --> 02:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
Public Radio article when they were
 
02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the New Hampshire veterans
 
02:48:46.610 --> 02:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
home and well the Federal Department of
 
02:48:49.010 --> 02:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
Veterans Affairs was requiring 115 000
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
of their front line workers to get
 
02:48:52.010 --> 02:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for the coveted with the
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccine and in that article it
 
02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
writes late last week Senator Cindy
 
02:48:58.849 --> 02:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald the national Democrats cited
 
02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
the same goal goal when she called on
 
02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
sununu to require the staff and the
 
02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
state's veterans homes representative
 
02:49:06.770 --> 02:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
gerhardt is this relevant to this bill
 
02:49:09.230 --> 02:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned about the desire to
 
02:49:11.330 --> 02:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
keep medical information private but

02:49:24.230 --> 02:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
02:49:26.570 --> 02:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
very much

okay

02:49:50.210 --> 02:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh hey thanks
 
02:49:53.929 --> 02:49:53.939 align:start position:0%
um I am uh appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
speak before the committee about this
 
02:49:58.969 --> 02:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
um I am represent Brentwood
 
02:50:01.790 --> 02:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm also here basically representing
 
02:50:04.370 --> 02:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
um as an individual who has you know
 
02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
about 30 years of Public Health
 
02:50:08.570 --> 02:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
Consulting experience with uh the state
 
02:50:09.889 --> 02:50:09.899 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire a variety of other
 
02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:11.760 align:start position:0%

02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:13.969 align:start position:0%
federal government
um

02:50:13.969 --> 02:50:13.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of it focused on data analysis
 
02:50:19.490 --> 02:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
I've worked with both Vital Statistics
 
02:50:21.650 --> 02:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
and with HIPAA protected information
 
02:50:24.650 --> 02:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
from from the state
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
um you know and I work on issues related
 
02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
to access to health care including rural
 
02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:29.870 align:start position:0%
to access to health care including rural
Health

02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
Health
 
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
um analysis
 
02:50:35.450 --> 02:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
um I am here to oppose the changes as
 
02:50:37.250 --> 02:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
they are currently
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
embodied in in the amended Bill uh
 
02:50:44.570 --> 02:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
I think if the issue surrounds HIPAA
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
there and and if this data that's been
 
02:50:48.650 --> 02:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
discussed is not covered by HIPAA I
 
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
think that is a valid issue that
 
02:50:53.330 --> 02:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
probably should be addressed through a
 
02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:54.349 align:start position:0%
probably should be addressed through a
variety

02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
variety
 
02:50:57.170 --> 02:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
of means but the
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
um content of the data versus the
 
02:51:01.730 --> 02:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
security of the data are two separate
 
02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:03.170 align:start position:0%
security of the data are two separate
issues

02:51:03.170 --> 02:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:51:03.180 --> 02:51:03.770 align:start position:0%
issues
um

02:51:03.770 --> 02:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:06.050 --> 02:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
HIPAA explicitly allows Public Health
 
02:51:08.690 --> 02:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
disclosure of personal health
 
02:51:08.700 --> 02:51:09.849 align:start position:0%
disclosure of personal health
information

02:51:09.849 --> 02:51:09.859 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
and birth outcome data the full set of
 
02:51:15.770 --> 02:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
it is one of the most basic sort of
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental public health statistics
 
02:51:21.790 --> 02:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's used across a wide variety of of
 
02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
both programs and public health analyzes
 
02:51:27.410 --> 02:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
so I think the presence of the
 
02:51:29.929 --> 02:51:29.939 align:start position:0%
identifiable information in birth record
 
02:51:29.939 --> 02:51:31.370 align:start position:0%
identifiable information in birth record
data

02:51:31.370 --> 02:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
is inherent it's critical to the use of
 
02:51:36.130 --> 02:51:36.140 align:start position:0%
the information
 
02:51:39.530 --> 02:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
and the linkage of that data
 
02:51:42.889 --> 02:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
um I the the way I see it is focused on
 
02:51:45.290 --> 02:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
two things that would be lost one is the
 
02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
ability to link to geography
 
02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:48.790 align:start position:0%
ability to link to geography
um

02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:51.469 --> 02:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide statistics are not uh
 
02:51:53.389 --> 02:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
particularly useful in this in this
 
02:51:53.399 --> 02:51:54.530 align:start position:0%
particularly useful in this in this
realm

02:51:54.530 --> 02:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
realm
 
02:51:56.929 --> 02:51:56.939 align:start position:0%
um and often we're looking for things at
 
02:51:59.690 --> 02:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
a much lower level the other thing is
 
02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
linkage between
 
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
the vital record data and other data
 
02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
sets you know even down to the level of
 
02:52:08.809 --> 02:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
the the link birth death records that
 
02:52:11.570 --> 02:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
that support infant mortality
 
02:52:11.580 --> 02:52:14.150 align:start position:0%
that support infant mortality
um

02:52:14.150 --> 02:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
government having the ability to make
 
02:52:20.929 --> 02:52:20.939 align:start position:0%
those linkages and what is disclosed so
 
02:52:22.730 --> 02:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's often the case that I will be
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
asking for statistics that are at a
 
02:52:28.250 --> 02:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
level too sensitive to be released but I
 
02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
can ask the government to aggregate
 
02:52:32.210 --> 02:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
these statistics for me and give it to
 
02:52:35.570 --> 02:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
me in an aggregated form that suits my
 
02:52:39.050 --> 02:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
purposes one one example is uh adhering
 
02:52:40.969 --> 02:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
to rural health definition used by the
 
02:52:42.530 --> 02:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
state so we make a distinction between
 
02:52:44.990 --> 02:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
rural versus non-rural areas
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
and aggregate the results though that is
 
02:52:49.849 --> 02:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
done at essentially a town or is it code
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
level depending on the definition so we
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
can re-aggregate those numbers based on
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
the geography without actually releasing
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
the specifics um about it so if you if
 
02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
you remove the identifiability of the
 
02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
data all that that leverage over the
 
02:53:06.170 --> 02:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
data is
 
02:53:06.180 --> 02:53:07.849 align:start position:0%
data is
um lost

02:53:07.849 --> 02:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
um lost
 
02:53:10.250 --> 02:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
um so I'm essentially hoping that
 
02:53:12.590 --> 02:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's a way to step back from
 
02:53:15.170 --> 02:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
sort of the current proposal get the
 
02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
data covered under HIPAA as it should be
 
02:53:22.849 --> 02:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
and to keep the content of the
 
02:53:25.010 --> 02:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
information that's needed for for public
 
02:53:26.809 --> 02:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
health purposes
 
02:53:29.389 --> 02:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
um there's a variety of ways in which
 
02:53:31.250 --> 02:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
that can be done one might be rehousing
 
02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
the data in a different uh agency the
 
02:53:37.550 --> 02:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
other might be what Texas is one example
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
they passed a law that essentially just
 
02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
said other other entities the hip is
 
02:53:45.050 --> 02:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
basically a floor for who has to adhere
 
02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:45.889 align:start position:0%
basically a floor for who has to adhere
to

02:53:45.889 --> 02:53:45.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:53:48.170 --> 02:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
these data security requirements it's
 
02:53:51.769 --> 02:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
not a ceiling House Bill 300 in Texas
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
from 2011 is an example it's a quite
 
02:53:56.030 --> 02:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
broad thing that they did and not
 
02:53:57.830 --> 02:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
advocating that but
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
um you know basically said that that
 
02:54:02.269 --> 02:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
requirement extends to other other
 
02:54:04.429 --> 02:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
entities besides sort of what HIPAA
 
02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
establishes if it can't be within a
 
02:54:09.230 --> 02:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
public health entity
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
um so I guess in closing I
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
I just want to say you know working
 
02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
across the country on issues like this I
 
02:54:17.990 --> 02:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
would hate for our state to be the one
 
02:54:20.990 --> 02:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
place where I can't obtain good Public
 
02:54:22.809 --> 02:54:22.819 align:start position:0%
Health birth information
 
02:54:25.690 --> 02:54:25.700 align:start position:0%
particularly as we deal with adverse
 
02:54:28.969 --> 02:54:28.979 align:start position:0%
outcomes for for birth
 
02:54:28.979 --> 02:54:29.570 align:start position:0%
outcomes for for birth
um

02:54:29.570 --> 02:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
going back to rural our state's lost 12
 
02:54:34.730 --> 02:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
um units at our hospitals in the last 20
 
02:54:39.170 --> 02:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
years uh one of them just within the
 
02:54:40.670 --> 02:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:54:43.849 --> 02:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
um so the the the the
 
02:54:43.859 --> 02:54:45.410 align:start position:0%
um so the the the the
um

02:54:45.410 --> 02:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:48.110 --> 02:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
delivery system uh that ties to these
 
02:54:50.090 --> 02:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
birth certificates is very much under
 
02:54:52.250 --> 02:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
under pressure right now and it's very
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
much important that we keep access to
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
being able to tie all this data together
 
02:54:59.570 --> 02:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
you know being respectful for people's
 
02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
private private health information it's
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
not easil it's this data is not easily
 
02:55:06.530 --> 02:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
obtained when it's when it's covered by
 
02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
the the health department but it needs
 
02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
to be accessible
 
02:55:12.290 --> 02:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
um I'll and I'll end with a really bad
 
02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
pun and just say don't um throw the baby
 
02:55:19.370 --> 02:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
right seeing none thank you for your
 
02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:24.730 align:start position:0%
right seeing none thank you for your
test

02:55:24.730 --> 02:55:24.740 align:start position:0%
test
 
02:55:26.809 --> 02:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
02:55:26.819 --> 02:55:28.010 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
um

02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
and in your experience
 
02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
um do research what do researchers go to
 
02:55:38.750 --> 02:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
Great Lengths to to secure the data and
 
02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
are they required
 
02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
which actually I know they are required
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:55:48.050 --> 02:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
tell you know tell the agency that's
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
given that you know like the vital
 
02:55:51.530 --> 02:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
records department here in New Hampshire
 
02:55:53.389 --> 02:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
and the other states like what what
 
02:55:55.130 --> 02:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with the data what
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
security measures are going to have in
 
02:55:59.330 --> 02:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
place is so is there a process and for
 
02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing and enforcing those uh those
 
02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:04.130 align:start position:0%
reviewing and enforcing those uh those
precautions

02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
precautions
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh thanks
 
02:56:08.510 --> 02:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
um representative hargan yeah uh in my
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
experience as as an outside contractor
 
02:56:14.269 --> 02:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
to state government
 
02:56:16.370 --> 02:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
um obtaining data that's not in the
 
02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
publicly available record set
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
um which basically means you're you're
 
02:56:22.730 --> 02:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
getting into some of the HIPAA protected
 
02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
fields that are contained in the data
 
02:56:27.889 --> 02:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
requires a fairly extensive
 
02:56:29.929 --> 02:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
um process by which you basically
 
02:56:33.290 --> 02:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
justify that the data that you're um
 
02:56:35.450 --> 02:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
requesting is needed for the intended
 
02:56:38.330 --> 02:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
purpose also HIPAA contains a minimum
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
minimum necessary standard so they'll
 
02:56:42.530 --> 02:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
only disclose what sort of absolutely
 
02:56:45.110 --> 02:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
has to be contained in order to satisfy
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
the question this question being asked
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we have to enter into essentially
 
02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
a business associate agreement which
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
puts us at as an organization my company
 
02:56:58.429 --> 02:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
at Great Financial Risk if we were to
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
accidentally even lose or disclose that
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
that data so it's kept on you know
 
02:57:06.290 --> 02:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
encrypted servers with limited access
 
02:57:08.570 --> 02:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
very compartmentalized
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
um when we when we're holding that
 
02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:11.630 align:start position:0%
um when we when we're holding that
information

02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:57:13.790 --> 02:57:13.800 align:start position:0%

of people who want to talk to us so
 
02:58:32.929 --> 02:58:32.939 align:start position:0%
please summarize sure sure it's a fairly
 
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
short anyway but basically
 
02:58:37.250 --> 02:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
um again I'm my name is Wayne McDonald
 
02:58:38.690 --> 02:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm a state
 
02:58:40.429 --> 02:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
representative from Rockingham County
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
District 16 which is the town of
 
02:58:45.290 --> 02:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
Londonderry I'm also the chairman of the
 
02:58:46.730 --> 02:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
house committee on Health and Human
 
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs and I also
 
02:58:51.410 --> 02:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned just a moment ago had the
 
02:58:52.730 --> 02:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
privilege of working for the Department
 
02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services for 23
 
02:58:57.469 --> 02:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
years as a fraud investigator
 
02:59:00.429 --> 02:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
and the unit that Mrs bibo currently
 
02:59:02.990 --> 02:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
oversees I retired as a senior
 
02:59:06.290 --> 02:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
investigator in June of 2019. I'm fully
 
02:59:08.990 --> 02:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
aware of the privacy concerns that that
 
02:59:12.170 --> 02:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
are expressed in this legislation and I
 
02:59:13.969 --> 02:59:13.979 align:start position:0%
know it it seeks to address and protect
 
02:59:16.610 --> 02:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
protect those concerns particularly in
 
02:59:18.650 --> 02:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
this day and age of identity theft how
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
we use our personal information and to
 
02:59:23.330 --> 02:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
whom we give it and why has never been
 
02:59:24.769 --> 02:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
more important than the need to be
 
02:59:26.929 --> 02:59:26.939 align:start position:0%
careful has never been greater but
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's a legitimate reason why
 
02:59:30.349 --> 02:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
government agencies collect certain
 
02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive information and two two great
 
02:59:34.969 --> 02:59:34.979 align:start position:0%
examples is the IRS and the Social
 
02:59:36.650 --> 02:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
Security Administration and it's it's
 
02:59:38.210 --> 02:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
obvious as to why they need certain
 
02:59:41.090 --> 02:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
sensitive information HHS here in the
 
02:59:43.070 --> 02:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services here in the
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire there's no
 
02:59:46.730 --> 02:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
exception to that rule
 
02:59:49.250 --> 02:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
um the ability of uh and speaking
 
02:59:51.290 --> 02:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
particularly from my background as a
 
02:59:53.150 --> 02:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
fraud investigator much of that
 
02:59:55.070 --> 02:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
information that we were able to collect
 
02:59:57.230 --> 02:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
through various means and that this bill
 
02:59:59.690 --> 02:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
would would Hinder would would affect
 
03:00:01.730 --> 03:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
the ability of the department to pursue
 
03:00:04.130 --> 03:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
overpaid benefits and food stamps and
 
03:00:05.929 --> 03:00:05.939 align:start position:0%
and cash assistance child care
 
03:00:08.330 --> 03:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
assistance Medicaid assistance we know
 
03:00:11.050 --> 03:00:11.060 align:start position:0%
that the Medicaid expenses have never
 
03:00:13.610 --> 03:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
it's important that we make sure
 
03:00:15.830 --> 03:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
everybody eligible for Medicaid gets it
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we don't want to
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
improperly administer benefits and
 
03:00:21.650 --> 03:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's always a concern of any
 
03:00:24.889 --> 03:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
improperly administered benefits even if
 
03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
somebody is not on public assistance
 
03:00:30.590 --> 03:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
the fact is that they could be aiding
 
03:00:32.450 --> 03:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
and abetting someone and so some of the
 
03:00:34.429 --> 03:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
information we would be able to get
 
03:00:36.769 --> 03:00:36.779 align:start position:0%
could affect our ability to pursue
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
somebody who nonetheless was jointly in
 
03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
severally liable for a public assistance
 
03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:42.889 align:start position:0%
severally liable for a public assistance
debt

03:00:42.889 --> 03:00:42.899 align:start position:0%
debt
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of being able to
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
find out where someone is working if we
 
03:00:48.769 --> 03:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
have a court order they they aided and
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
embedded in a welfare fraud they're
 
03:00:53.330 --> 03:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
jointly insibly liable for this maybe
 
03:00:54.889 --> 03:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
they weren't on assistance but they
 
03:00:57.170 --> 03:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
helped by lying about their whereabouts
 
03:00:58.429 --> 03:00:58.439 align:start position:0%
whether they were in the home or
 
03:01:01.610 --> 03:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
something or otherwise assisted in the
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
commission of the fraud so for that
 
03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:04.610 align:start position:0%
commission of the fraud so for that
reason

03:01:04.610 --> 03:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:01:06.889 --> 03:01:06.899 align:start position:0%
uh this information is very very
 
03:01:09.170 --> 03:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
important I would much of the
 
03:01:11.210 --> 03:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
information we're talking about uh was
 
03:01:15.610 --> 03:01:15.620 align:start position:0%
important to me in 211 211 successful
 
03:01:17.929 --> 03:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
prosecutions of both a felony and a
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor nature during my career and
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's very important in terms of
 
03:01:24.290 --> 03:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
safeguarding public dollars and honoring
 
03:01:27.410 --> 03:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
our commitment not only to clients uh as
 
03:01:28.969 --> 03:01:28.979 align:start position:0%
as they relate to the department but
 
03:01:31.610 --> 03:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
also to the taxpayer the absence of this
 
03:01:33.309 --> 03:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
critically important information
 
03:01:35.210 --> 03:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
can also
 
03:01:37.309 --> 03:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
um you know affect child support in in
 
03:01:40.849 --> 03:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
terms of their duties to um uh determine
 
03:01:44.090 --> 03:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
paternity and pursue absent fathers and
 
03:01:46.849 --> 03:01:46.859 align:start position:0%
or mothers usually it's an absent uh
 
03:01:49.250 --> 03:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
father but it can be the one
 
03:01:51.290 --> 03:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
um also uh they have an interstate unit
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
in the Department of Division of Child
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
Support and their ability to go across
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
state lines and pursue uh people would
 
03:02:01.309 --> 03:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
be affected in that regard also
 
03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the over a very legitimate
 
03:02:06.170 --> 03:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
concern over privacy if I could go back
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
to that for a moment because I it's
 
03:02:10.010 --> 03:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
something that concerns us all uh it's
 
03:02:11.809 --> 03:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
important for all of you to know that
 
03:02:14.210 --> 03:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
all Department employees on onto a very
 
03:02:16.969 --> 03:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
strict confidentiality requirements the
 
03:02:18.889 --> 03:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
information the department gathers may
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
not be used except in the confines of
 
03:02:22.990 --> 03:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
its specific official responsibilities
 
03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
personal information is not treated
 
03:02:28.130 --> 03:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
lightly and it is not misused it's
 
03:02:29.690 --> 03:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
further my understanding that no other
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
state has imposed these types of
 
03:02:33.769 --> 03:02:33.779 align:start position:0%
restrictions as enumerated in this bill
 
03:02:36.469 --> 03:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
and I suspect the reason is in part for
 
03:02:39.290 --> 03:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
the concerns I have expressed and so my
 
03:02:40.490 --> 03:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the interest of the
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we serve and for that matter
 
03:02:44.570 --> 03:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
all of our fellow citizens I urge you to
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
amend this bill and remove section 2 or
 
03:02:49.130 --> 03:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
vote the entire Bill and expedient to
 
03:02:51.170 --> 03:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
legislate and that concludes my
 
03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
testimony Madam chairman
 
03:02:55.610 --> 03:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you to take questions if you have
 
03:02:59.050 --> 03:02:59.060 align:start position:0%
any representative Schmidt
 
03:03:01.250 --> 03:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
mining representative good afternoon
 
03:03:03.349 --> 03:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative it's it's crossed the
 
03:03:06.290 --> 03:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
noontime hour and return the greeting to
 
03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
you representative good to see you so
 
03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
um my question is how many of the
 
03:03:14.809 --> 03:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
questions on this questionnaire which I
 
03:03:16.269 --> 03:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
must say I find
 
03:03:20.090 --> 03:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily intrusive I I've sir I
 
03:03:22.490 --> 03:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
served for about five or six years on
 
03:03:26.510 --> 03:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
the vital records privacy board which uh
 
03:03:30.550 --> 03:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
oversees requests for information
 
03:03:33.490 --> 03:03:33.500 align:start position:0%
aggregated information that individual
 
03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
identifiable information but aggregated
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
information regarding all kinds of
 
03:03:40.210 --> 03:03:40.220 align:start position:0%
things births deaths
 
03:03:42.849 --> 03:03:42.859 align:start position:0%
illnesses and so forth so I understand
 
03:03:47.630 --> 03:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
the extraordinarily valuable uh aspect
 
03:03:51.410 --> 03:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
of comprehensive information that is
 
03:03:54.889 --> 03:03:54.899 align:start position:0%
collected about people but I must say I
 
03:03:57.429 --> 03:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
find this this form
 
03:04:00.290 --> 03:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily intrusive and my
 
03:04:04.010 --> 03:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
question is how much of this can a can a
 
03:04:06.769 --> 03:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
person who's filling it out say
 
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
won't answer that won't answer that
 
03:04:11.570 --> 03:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
won't answer that
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
and because
 
03:04:15.889 --> 03:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
some of this stuff I mean Senator
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald in her testimony
 
03:04:22.690 --> 03:04:22.700 align:start position:0%
hypothesized several uh questions that
 
03:04:26.330 --> 03:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh that might be asked of a male
 
03:04:28.010 --> 03:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:04:30.530 --> 03:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and and many of them just glancing
 
03:04:32.570 --> 03:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
through this are as I say
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily intrusive
 
03:04:37.690 --> 03:04:37.700 align:start position:0%
and while it might be very interesting
 
03:04:40.849 --> 03:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
and in political or important for the
 
03:04:42.889 --> 03:04:42.899 align:start position:0%
state and the government to know about
 
03:04:42.899 --> 03:04:44.090 align:start position:0%
state and the government to know about
it

03:04:44.090 --> 03:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
putting it all down on a on a form like
 
03:04:50.929 --> 03:04:50.939 align:start position:0%
this with your name date of birth social
 
03:04:54.050 --> 03:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
security number and all that makes you
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
that Nails you down Nails the person
 
03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:58.690 align:start position:0%
that Nails you down Nails the person
down

03:04:58.690 --> 03:04:58.700 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
unmistakably uh is like a ticking Time
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
Bomb I think regardless of all the
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
the guarantees that you've referenced
 
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
the ticking Time Bomb because it has
 
03:05:13.969 --> 03:05:13.979 align:start position:0%
your brother Schmidt what is your
 
03:05:16.250 --> 03:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
question my question I already asked the
 
03:05:18.410 --> 03:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
question okay I already asked the
 
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
question but I'm saying that this is
 
03:05:23.110 --> 03:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
once you put your name on it
 
03:05:28.610 --> 03:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
and handed away you've you've handed uh
 
03:05:31.550 --> 03:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
a ticking Time Bomb away in my opinion
 
03:05:35.710 --> 03:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
so what on this form can uh the the the
 
03:05:40.370 --> 03:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
mother in this case can she refuse to to
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
answer she can't tell a lie according to
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
the form yes thank you but can she can
 
03:05:48.050 --> 03:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
she answer your question yeah
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt uh the department
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
could probably answer that better than I
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
can I don't know there are several
 
03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
people from the Department uh but uh
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that this this
 
03:06:02.210 --> 03:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
section too that we're most concerned
 
03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
about restricts the ability of the
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
department to collect the information
 
03:06:09.050 --> 03:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
but that if him can correct me or
 
03:06:10.969 --> 03:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone else can who follows
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
that they can't be compelled to give
 
03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
some of the information but that um
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
this would hinder the ability of the
 
03:06:19.969 --> 03:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
department to even collect it and all of
 
03:06:22.130 --> 03:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
this I can assure you is relevant to the
 
03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
various investigations over 2300
 
03:06:26.929 --> 03:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
investigations I conducted all of this
 
03:06:29.389 --> 03:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
was very relevant very useful very
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
carefully safeguarded and it would be
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunate to lose this information
 
03:06:36.769 --> 03:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
um you know and and be uh you know in
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to collect the
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
literally millions and millions of
 
03:06:42.230 --> 03:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
dollars the the special investigations
 
03:06:42.240 --> 03:06:43.150 align:start position:0%
dollars the the special investigations
unit

03:06:43.150 --> 03:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
specifically was able to bring back to
 
03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
the stake office
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
so I believe there is some some refusal
 
03:06:52.730 --> 03:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
ability on the part of a client of an
 
03:06:55.490 --> 03:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
individual but um in terms of the
 
03:06:57.290 --> 03:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to collect this
 
03:06:57.300 --> 03:06:59.030 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to collect this
information

03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
um you know it nonetheless is important
 
03:07:02.809 --> 03:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I've answered your
 
03:07:04.849 --> 03:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
question Mira no that helps thank you
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:12.290 --> 03:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
03:07:14.929 --> 03:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
that's like I actually I am currently
 
03:07:16.969 --> 03:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
serving on the board that representative
 
03:07:19.510 --> 03:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
Schmidt mentioned and um
 
03:07:21.889 --> 03:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
how do you um
 
03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
but so I understand
 
03:07:26.330 --> 03:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
um you know there's privacy concerns and
 
03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
you do protection simply so how do you
 
03:07:31.070 --> 03:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
balance um those against the fact that
 
03:07:32.090 --> 03:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
especially when you have a health
 
03:07:34.010 --> 03:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
emergency like the covid
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's useful to have very
 
03:07:39.290 --> 03:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
detailed information in order to combat
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of the misinformation that goes
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
around looking thank you good thanks
 
03:07:45.650 --> 03:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
Jennifer again thanks like in the case
 
03:07:47.630 --> 03:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
of that yeah it was definitely it was a
 
03:07:49.490 --> 03:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus and that there were
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
excess deaths and I'm not yeah in terms
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
of misinformation I'm not sure you mean
 
03:07:56.210 --> 03:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
if they they provided false information
 
03:07:59.090 --> 03:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
is that what you mean um I'm not sure I
 
03:08:01.490 --> 03:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
understand your question well also well
 
03:08:03.110 --> 03:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
not so much that but also sometimes
 
03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
people will expel those theories that
 
03:08:07.570 --> 03:08:07.580 align:start position:0%
aren't actually supported but
 
03:08:10.250 --> 03:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
please don't Hector the the the
 
03:08:10.260 --> 03:08:12.349 align:start position:0%
please don't Hector the the the
testifier

03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to do that no but
 
03:08:17.090 --> 03:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and again if the information they
 
03:08:19.370 --> 03:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
give us is accurate it can sometimes
 
03:08:21.769 --> 03:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
support suspicions if it's inaccurate
 
03:08:23.690 --> 03:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's further false information that
 
03:08:26.450 --> 03:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
can be used in a potential prosecution
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
effort or a um an administrative
 
03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
disqualification effort that that would
 
03:08:34.370 --> 03:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
go through the administrative Appeals
 
03:08:34.380 --> 03:08:35.750 align:start position:0%
go through the administrative Appeals
Unit

03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
Unit
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
um you know so I I uh I I was not in the
 
03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
unit during the pandemic and Mrs bibo if
 
03:08:43.969 --> 03:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
you're able to testify in terms of speak
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
at all to the how the unit function
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
03:08:51.410 --> 03:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
well I I would like to clarify that if a
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
mother does misrepresent or or withhold
 
03:08:58.429 --> 03:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
information on this form that is out of
 
03:09:01.250 --> 03:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
the outside of the purview of what
 
03:09:03.950 --> 03:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
special investigations unit does we
 
03:09:07.250 --> 03:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
would not we are not the unit that would
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
try and enforce there are other portions
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
of HHS that have said they will be
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
testifying so right we can't uh we can't
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
I someone has a question okay thank you
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:09:27.230 --> 03:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:29.330 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

the consequences of Senate Bill 105
 
03:10:52.730 --> 03:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
would have on many programs and funding
 
03:10:55.309 --> 03:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
the impact of the data collection would
 
03:10:59.210 --> 03:10:59.220 align:start position:0%

maternal Health disparities in our state
 
03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:09.000 align:start position:0%

overall Rule and non-rule the rate of no
 
03:11:17.330 --> 03:11:17.340 align:start position:0%

03:11:20.570 --> 03:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
times higher without access to this data
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
from Vital Records the state wouldn't
 
03:11:24.710 --> 03:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
have no way of assessing or tracking
 
03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:26.760 align:start position:0%

03:11:35.330 --> 03:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
appropriately Additionally the vital
 
03:11:37.849 --> 03:11:37.859 align:start position:0%
health information allows the state to
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
understand and track maternity care
 
03:11:43.550 --> 03:11:43.560 align:start position:0%

03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
not account for the distance traveled
 
03:11:48.170 --> 03:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
for birth without this data New
 
03:11:49.969 --> 03:11:49.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would not be able to determine
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
where parents are traveling from
 
03:11:54.230 --> 03:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
removing the opportunity to create
 
03:11:57.650 --> 03:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
better access late entry into prenatal
 
03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
care is a red flag for poor birth
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
outcome the timely report of 2022 allows
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
for early intervention to affect the
 
03:12:10.010 --> 03:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
entry into prenatal care this is just
 
03:12:12.230 --> 03:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
one example of the negative consequences
 
03:12:15.530 --> 03:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
of the impact of Senate Bill 105 will
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
have on Health Care in New Hampshire and
 
03:12:20.210 --> 03:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote no I'm happy to
 
03:12:22.130 --> 03:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
answer your questions and again thank
 
03:12:24.050 --> 03:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to address the
 
03:12:24.060 --> 03:12:25.010 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to address the
commission

03:12:25.010 --> 03:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to add one other
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
thought after hearing some of the
 
03:12:29.520 --> 03:12:30.950 align:start position:0%
thought after hearing some of the
testimony

03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:31.550 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

03:12:31.550 --> 03:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:33.530 --> 03:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
having filled that report out three
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
times earlier in my life
 
03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I understand that it would be a
 
03:12:39.469 --> 03:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
little bit like well how many drinks did
 
03:12:43.010 --> 03:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
you have a day but without that data we
 
03:12:45.110 --> 03:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
never would have uncovered fetal alcohol
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
syndrome and over the last 25 to 30
 
03:12:50.210 --> 03:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
years we wouldn't have provided the
 
03:12:52.490 --> 03:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
counseling to patients of the importance
 
03:12:54.170 --> 03:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
of not drinking when they were pregnant
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to clarify that
 
03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhard thank
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just curious I don't
 
03:13:02.990 --> 03:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
know if you can answer this but can you
 
03:13:04.730 --> 03:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted for the answers you give
 
03:13:07.370 --> 03:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
to that questionnaire
 
03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
I have never heard of anyone being
 
03:13:11.450 --> 03:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for being for the answers
 
03:13:12.889 --> 03:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
that they gave to that questionnaire
 
03:13:15.650 --> 03:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:13:17.769 --> 03:13:17.779 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're very welcome
 
03:13:20.510 --> 03:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I apologize for
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
speaking so much sharply to you that if
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
you don't speak into the microphone we
 
03:13:30.889 --> 03:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
can't hear you and you're being recorded
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
so that people who are watching and so
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
forth so I apologize for speaking so
 
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
much sharply uh but but your testimony
 
03:13:42.170 --> 03:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
is very very informative and many of the
 
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
things you referenced in your final
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
remark are part of the person's medical
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
record are they not yes okay in other
 
03:13:53.389 --> 03:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
words that that the the scientific
 
03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
discoveries that were based on
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
you say on the on fetal alcohol syndrome
 
03:14:04.010 --> 03:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
yeah that's an example of it yes uh some
 
03:14:06.050 --> 03:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
of the things that this form is very
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
intrusive uh in asking uh it would also
 
03:14:12.370 --> 03:14:12.380 align:start position:0%
be in the person's medical record
 
03:14:14.750 --> 03:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
separately would it not
 
03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
well yes it would be but there would be
 
03:14:18.889 --> 03:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
no data collection from the person's
 
03:14:20.750 --> 03:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
private medical record
 
03:14:23.090 --> 03:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
the data collection is from the birth
 
03:14:26.830 --> 03:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
report the birth certificate report
 
03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
but I'm very concerned about the Privacy
 
03:14:34.010 --> 03:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
aspect I understand so is there not a
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
possibility that that the form could be
 
03:14:40.370 --> 03:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
divided into things that are mandatory
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
and it would serve the purpose you're
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:14:47.570 --> 03:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
but would not be intrusive in terms of
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff that that I
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
might be I'm sure it's helpful to the
 
03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
authorities to know but you're asking
 
03:14:58.250 --> 03:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
people to basically lay their lives bare
 
03:15:01.130 --> 03:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
in many many respects and I have a
 
03:15:02.570 --> 03:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
concern about that
 
03:15:04.849 --> 03:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
I I understand I think that people from
 
03:15:06.610 --> 03:15:06.620 align:start position:0%
the Department could probably answer
 
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
that question with complete accuracy but
 
03:15:13.610 --> 03:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
I understand that it's a national data
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
collection system in all 50 states use
 
03:15:19.969 --> 03:15:19.979 align:start position:0%
the same collecting mechanism but they
 
03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
really are the experts not me about that
 
03:15:25.130 --> 03:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
you just turned your microphone off
 
03:15:52.130 --> 03:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's better thank you
 
03:15:54.410 --> 03:15:54.420 align:start position:0%

03:17:06.950 --> 03:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide additional
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
information about Senate Bill 105 and
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
the way that it would have unintended
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
impacts on the residents of New
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today Dr Chan and I are here
 
03:17:17.809 --> 03:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
to consid to ask you to consider to
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
either itl the bill in front of you or
 
03:17:23.330 --> 03:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
modify it in such a way to further
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
protect privacy and ensure that Granite
 
03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
Staters still can continue to easily
 
03:17:31.190 --> 03:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
access the level of public health health
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
care and economic supports that they
 
03:17:36.769 --> 03:17:36.779 align:start position:0%
receive today specifically section two
 
03:17:39.530 --> 03:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the bill is unworkable we are just a
 
03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
few of the many individuals here today
 
03:17:43.610 --> 03:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
deeply concerned that section 2 may
 
03:17:45.889 --> 03:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
impact not only our funding but the
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
public health health care delivery and
 
03:17:51.230 --> 03:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
economic supports of real individuals in
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
your communities notably sections one
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
and four of the bill can work hand in
 
03:18:00.230 --> 03:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
hand with existing privacy and security
 
03:18:02.330 --> 03:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
governance and existing New Hampshire
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
and federal statutes including HIPAA
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
standards in particular we are very
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with section one which
 
03:18:12.410 --> 03:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
removes the penalties for the health
 
03:18:12.420 --> 03:18:13.849 align:start position:0%
removes the penalties for the health
questions

03:18:13.849 --> 03:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:18:16.130 --> 03:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
I've broken my golden rule of only
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
providing short and sweet testimony
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
today you'll see that the written
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of you is over eight
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
pages long I am not going to read that
 
03:18:26.690 --> 03:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
um but the reason why the testimony is
 
03:18:28.610 --> 03:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
so dense is because the wide reaching
 
03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
impacts of the bill as we have
 
03:18:32.929 --> 03:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
researched and talked to Partners we
 
03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
continue to peel back the onion about
 
03:18:38.570 --> 03:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
the many ways SB 105 would weaken the
 
03:18:40.730 --> 03:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
foundation of services that individuals
 
03:18:43.550 --> 03:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
use every day from access to care at a
 
03:18:45.650 --> 03:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Center to
 
03:18:47.990 --> 03:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that your baby has the right
 
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
screening services in the hospital to
 
03:18:53.650 --> 03:18:53.660 align:start position:0%
accessing child support and so much more
 
03:18:56.210 --> 03:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
importantly the privacy of this
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
sensitive data is already protected by
 
03:19:01.969 --> 03:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
existing state and federal statutes and
 
03:19:04.429 --> 03:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
the strong data governance systems that
 
03:19:06.469 --> 03:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
are in place both at the Secretary of
 
03:19:08.450 --> 03:19:08.460 align:start position:0%

Health and Human Services chapter law 5
 
03:19:14.090 --> 03:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
C4 states that the Registrar of Vital
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%

03:19:19.130 --> 03:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
the privacy of individuals about whom
 
03:19:21.530 --> 03:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
information is given and to underscore
 
03:19:24.769 --> 03:19:24.779 align:start position:0%
represented rosenwald's testimony no
 
03:19:27.530 --> 03:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
names are sent to CDC or the national

Center of health statistics since 1907
 
03:19:34.790 --> 03:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
the United States has used the data in
 
03:19:37.610 --> 03:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
birth certificates to ensure citizenship
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
proof of age to prevent child labor and
 
03:19:43.309 --> 03:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
to prevent fraud for entitlement
 
03:19:45.889 --> 03:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
programs and government benefits in
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
accordance with the federal Public
 
03:19:50.570 --> 03:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
Health Service Act all 50 states now ask
 
03:19:53.809 --> 03:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
a standard set of questions this is to
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
ensure inter-jurisdictional exchange if
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
I am a New Hampshire resident and I have
 
03:20:01.969 --> 03:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
my baby in Massachusetts data can easily
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
be exchanged and understood here in New

Hampshire if I am a Vermont resident and
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
I have my baby here in New Hampshire
 
03:20:12.190 --> 03:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
similarly the birth record must be
 
03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
standardized with your Indulgence I'm
 
03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to talk about just a little bit
 
03:20:18.110 --> 03:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
about the four areas that have
 
03:20:20.090 --> 03:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
significant financial and statutory
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
implications of this bill as an
 
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of section 2
 
03:20:27.769 --> 03:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
there are critical services at risk when
 
03:20:30.170 --> 03:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
we de-identify elements of birth
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
certificate data I'm also going to
 
03:20:34.010 --> 03:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
highlight the programmatic areas of the
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
state that would be at risk for fraud as
 
03:20:38.450 --> 03:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald noted because we
 
03:20:40.490 --> 03:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
may not have a complete data set to
 
03:20:44.269 --> 03:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
compare eligibility applications to or
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
use for investigation there are a number
 
03:20:49.190 --> 03:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
of other existing statutes that are in
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
conflict with Senate Bill 105 that would
 
03:20:54.530 --> 03:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
need to be changed if section 2 were
 
03:20:57.410 --> 03:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
enacted and of course there's money
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the federal funds both DHHS
 
03:21:01.490 --> 03:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State's office
 
03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
would lose for programs and data system
 
03:21:05.690 --> 03:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
modernization because New Hampshire
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
would no longer have complete data you
 
03:21:10.849 --> 03:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
can shrug your Collective shoulders at
 
03:21:13.070 --> 03:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
less money for the state oh well or the
 
03:21:15.769 --> 03:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
sky is falling but fewer federal funds
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
means fewer basic supports like high
 
03:21:22.010 --> 03:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
quality Health Care prenatal care in
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
your communities for your constituents
 
03:21:26.450 --> 03:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
these programs have real life
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
consequences if New Hampshire does not
 
03:21:31.070 --> 03:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
have complete birth records as section 2
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
is written it is unclear how data will
 
03:21:35.809 --> 03:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
be exchanged with these Social Security
 
03:21:35.819 --> 03:21:37.490 align:start position:0%

currently all infants automatically
 
03:21:41.570 --> 03:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
receive their social security number
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
because States send birth records to the
 
03:21:46.610 --> 03:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
Social Security Administration if
 
03:21:49.250 --> 03:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
enacted it is possible that all 12 000
 
03:21:51.050 --> 03:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families a year who have
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
babies would need to then bring hard
 
03:21:55.370 --> 03:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
copies of their birth certificate to
 
03:21:57.170 --> 03:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
facilitate the issuance of their social

security number for their infant this is
 
03:22:01.429 --> 03:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a significant hardship on

that screening within 24 hours of birth
 
03:24:33.769 --> 03:24:33.779 align:start position:0%
we use the birth record every single day

to make sure no baby gets left behind it
 
03:24:39.290 --> 03:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
isn't an overstatement that without this

or kind of guess the impacts of

complete data set director Kieran Karen
 
03:26:39.050 --> 03:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
here but I'm going to do the same thing
 
03:26:40.610 --> 03:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to show back to somebody else
 
03:26:44.330 --> 03:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
is available to speak to this about what
 
03:26:45.889 --> 03:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to do in the

fraud
 
03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
without going into detail and I won't
 
03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
because my time is short section 2
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
directly impacts and conflicts with
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
additional existing statutes and rsh 126
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
and 5c that all would need to be
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
addressed section 2 would require A
 
03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
thorough review of existing statutes
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
we and finally there is the money our
 
03:28:09.889 --> 03:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
fiscal note which you can read on your
 
03:28:11.929 --> 03:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
own time describes in detail what
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
federal grants would be in significant
 
03:28:15.769 --> 03:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy without the ability to analyze
 
03:28:19.490 --> 03:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
complete birth data there is estimate it
 
03:28:22.490 --> 03:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
is estimated to be tens of millions of
 
03:28:25.849 --> 03:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
dollars that would not be available
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
we all agree that privacy is important
 
03:28:32.330 --> 03:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
and Dave Wieters I'll punt it back to
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
him is available to describe all the
 
03:28:37.969 --> 03:28:37.979 align:start position:0%
ways we guard and protect data this most
 
03:28:41.030 --> 03:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
important and very private and very
 
03:28:42.910 --> 03:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive health information
 
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS is a HIPAA covered entity and
 
03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
complies with all federal statutes to
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
protect against the inappropriate
 
03:28:52.610 --> 03:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
disclosure of private information Mr
 
03:28:54.469 --> 03:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
readers can also describe the data

governance and stewardship strategies
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
that are currently in place to minimize
 
03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
the data elements that individuals may
 
03:29:04.809 --> 03:29:04.819 align:start position:0%
access while doing legitimate Department
 
03:29:07.490 --> 03:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
functions to answer a question earlier
 
03:29:09.650 --> 03:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
can you just see the whole record and
 
03:29:12.050 --> 03:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
the answer is no if my job is to
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
investigate one particular thing I can
 
03:29:17.570 --> 03:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
see this much of the record if my job
 
03:29:20.330 --> 03:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
however is to do the quality assurance
 
03:29:22.729 --> 03:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
on the entire birth record as is our
 
03:29:25.370 --> 03:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility in statute you will see
 
03:29:28.250 --> 03:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
more of the record we have strict data
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
governance that limits and is focused on
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
data minimization so you only see what
 
03:29:37.849 --> 03:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
you need to see to do your job
 
03:29:39.530 --> 03:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
um I'll end by suggesting that section
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
one of the bill and section four of the
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill both Advance privacy section one is
 
03:29:46.610 --> 03:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
the section that takes away the uh
 
03:29:48.590 --> 03:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty for the health area
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is an area that we do not disagree
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
with there has never been a time in
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
anyone's understanding where anyone was
 
03:29:57.410 --> 03:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for a criminal penalty for
 
03:30:00.349 --> 03:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
saying there were 125 pounds before they
 
03:30:02.330 --> 03:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
were uh before they were pregnant and
 
03:30:04.969 --> 03:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
when they were actually 140 that has not
 
03:30:07.250 --> 03:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
happened we're happy to put that in
 
03:30:07.260 --> 03:30:08.450 align:start position:0%
happened we're happy to put that in
statute

03:30:08.450 --> 03:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
section 4 of the bill also further
 
03:30:13.570 --> 03:30:13.580 align:start position:0%
advances privacy and security by
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
potentially limiting the the amount of
 
03:30:19.490 --> 03:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
time that records are kept in a hospital
 
03:30:22.429 --> 03:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
so I will um sum up right now by saying
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill is unworkable
 
03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
for all of those many reasons we are
 
03:30:28.130 --> 03:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
very concerned for both Public Health
 
03:30:30.889 --> 03:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
the health care delivery system and the
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
economic supports of your families
 
03:30:36.650 --> 03:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
I think not
 
03:30:40.250 --> 03:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much I have a
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair is this going to a
 
03:30:44.450 --> 03:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this is
 
03:30:47.450 --> 03:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
way too complicated to handle in one
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
simple hearing is this going to go
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
I haven't yet decided which one but it
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
probably should I
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
we we need to hear from these people at
 
03:31:02.830 --> 03:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
greater lengths with regard to specifics
 
03:31:05.690 --> 03:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:31:07.190 --> 03:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I'm not sure you
 
03:31:12.050 --> 03:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
can answer it and don't try if you can't
 
03:31:12.060 --> 03:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
can answer it and don't try if you can't
um

03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand this form gets
 
03:31:16.969 --> 03:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
filled out and it's sent to Vital
 
03:31:16.979 --> 03:31:18.290 align:start position:0%
filled out and it's sent to Vital
Records

03:31:18.290 --> 03:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
Records
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
and then they disclose it to you and you
 
03:31:24.170 --> 03:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
hold it under hhas under HIPAA rules
 
03:31:27.050 --> 03:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
sure so that's a great question and you
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
know the Secretary of State's office who
 
03:31:30.650 --> 03:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
was the owner of the vital records can
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
probably provide greater detail but what
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
happens is the hospitals or the birth
 
03:31:36.530 --> 03:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
attendant if it doesn't occur in the
 
03:31:38.929 --> 03:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
hospital completes the forms the forms
 
03:31:41.090 --> 03:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
get uploaded and sent to Vital Records
 
03:31:41.100 --> 03:31:42.769 align:start position:0%
get uploaded and sent to Vital Records
electronically

03:31:42.769 --> 03:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
um uh 5c then states that the records
 
03:31:49.370 --> 03:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
then go to DHHS because we have a
 
03:31:51.769 --> 03:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
tangible interest in the birth record of
 
03:31:53.450 --> 03:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
note New Hampshire is the only state in
 
03:31:55.490 --> 03:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
the country that has Vital Records
 
03:31:57.650 --> 03:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
outside of the Department of Health 49
 
03:31:59.570 --> 03:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
other states keep this record within the
 
03:32:01.610 --> 03:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Health however we have a
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
great relationship with Secretary of
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
State we have an incredibly detailed
 
03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding that
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
describes how the data moves from point
 
03:32:11.809 --> 03:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
A to point B and how it is governed
 
03:32:14.570 --> 03:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay
 
03:32:16.870 --> 03:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:20.389 --> 03:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative grassy
 
03:32:20.399 --> 03:32:21.290 align:start position:0%
yes representative grassy
um

03:32:21.290 --> 03:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:21.300 --> 03:32:23.389 align:start position:0%
um
question

03:32:23.389 --> 03:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
look over she's gone
 
03:32:30.650 --> 03:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
very quick
 
03:32:32.269 --> 03:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
um yes I mean one of the things that
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
really distressed me I've worked on a
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
number of Grants over the years in
 
03:32:37.190 --> 03:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
Stratford County and we have a very
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
distinct division between Northern
 
03:32:40.969 --> 03:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
Stratford County and Southern Stratford
 
03:32:43.010 --> 03:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
County as far as health is concerned and
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
particularly as far as prenatal care is
 
03:32:47.389 --> 03:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
concerned and one of the things you said
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
is that what this is going to do is that
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
in the future if this is passed and I'm
 
03:32:54.889 --> 03:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
looking at redistributing money within
 
03:32:56.929 --> 03:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
Stratford County to direct more Aid to
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
the northern part of Stratford County
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
which has more problems that that's
 
03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
going to be impossible for me to make
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
that would be true
 
03:33:07.610 --> 03:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
um So currently as section two is is
 
03:33:10.010 --> 03:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
written we would substitute in the
 
03:33:11.690 --> 03:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
hospital so you would just know where
 
03:33:13.849 --> 03:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
babies were born Portsmouth Portsmouth
 
03:33:16.190 --> 03:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
so we would have no information about
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
Stratford County and the unique needs of
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
Northern Stratford County versus the
 
03:33:21.469 --> 03:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
unique needs of Southern Stratford
 
03:33:21.479 --> 03:33:22.490 align:start position:0%
unique needs of Southern Stratford
County

03:33:22.490 --> 03:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
County
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:33:28.610 --> 03:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
all this information that you're going
 
03:33:32.150 --> 03:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
to lose
 
03:33:34.729 --> 03:33:34.739 align:start position:0%
is because you don't have the name and
 
03:33:38.210 --> 03:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
address yes so the name so there are two
 
03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
things there are a number of
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
complicating things here but I'll answer
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
the the easy way first without the name
 
03:33:46.729 --> 03:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
and address specifically the address we
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
don't know where those people are from
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
so um in Senator rosenwald's
 
03:33:54.050 --> 03:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
um bill it says the hospital and this
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
was a great example in Stratford County
 
03:33:58.190 --> 03:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
babies in Stratford County frisbee has
 
03:33:59.690 --> 03:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
just closed its Labor and Delivery
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
Services we've got Wentworth Douglas and
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
we've got Portsmouth we don't know where
 
03:34:06.050 --> 03:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
those people would we would not know
 
03:34:07.849 --> 03:34:07.859 align:start position:0%
where those people live so we would not
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
know those that are at higher risk who
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
did not get adequate prenatal care some
 
03:34:14.690 --> 03:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
of the questions on that form sound
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
incredibly intrusive when was your last
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
menstrual period Ike who wants to answer
 
03:34:21.290 --> 03:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
that but the reason we answer that is
 
03:34:23.330 --> 03:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
that directly tells us what prematurity
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
rates are that's the reason for the um
 
03:34:28.490 --> 03:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
for the question what section one of the
 
03:34:30.050 --> 03:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
bill does is take away the criminal
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
penalties we are all in agreement that
 
03:34:34.969 --> 03:34:34.979 align:start position:0%
criminal there don't need to be criminal
 
03:34:37.729 --> 03:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
penalties for that portion however we do
 
03:34:39.530 --> 03:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
believe there need to be penalties about
 
03:34:43.910 --> 03:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
the facts of the birth mom dad residence
 
03:34:47.090 --> 03:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
you and can I just quickly excuse me can
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
I just quickly add that
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I I we obviously share the
 
03:34:53.809 --> 03:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
goal of protecting personal and health
 
03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
related information but it also remains
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
important uh to have access to usable
 
03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
actionable data and that's one of the
 
03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
core tenets of Public Health Data and
 
03:35:05.809 --> 03:35:05.819 align:start position:0%
public health having access to this data
 
03:35:07.969 --> 03:35:07.979 align:start position:0%
is that we don't hold a data set just
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
for the sake of having a data set we use
 
03:35:12.410 --> 03:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
that data to promote Health to protect
 
03:35:14.030 --> 03:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
individuals health and that's done in a
 
03:35:16.190 --> 03:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
variety of ways but it requires having
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
that personal identifiable information
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
and so you know director Tilly
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
highlighted many examples of how that
 
03:35:25.130 --> 03:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
data is used newborn screening in order
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
to identify babies that are newly born
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they undergo the
 
03:35:31.130 --> 03:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
necessary health screening
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
we use the birth record to report on and
 
03:35:36.170 --> 03:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
intervene on issues around teen births
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
for example we need that information in
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
the in the birth record
 
03:35:42.410 --> 03:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and so the goals of protecting
 
03:35:44.410 --> 03:35:44.420 align:start position:0%
personal and health related information
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
while also having access to usable
 
03:35:50.210 --> 03:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
actionable information are not mutually
 
03:35:52.370 --> 03:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
exclusive and it becomes important not
 
03:35:54.410 --> 03:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
only for public health to have access to
 
03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
it but also our local Hospital health
 
03:35:59.210 --> 03:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
care and Community Partners For example
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
for exactly the the reasons that you're
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
highlighting thanks thank you
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gould thank you madam
 
03:36:05.880 --> 03:36:06.650 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gould thank you madam
chair

03:36:06.650 --> 03:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:36:08.809 --> 03:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with I had heard
 
03:36:11.279 --> 03:36:12.229 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with I had heard
that

03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
I had heard a rumor and then something
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
you said is making me feel the need to
 
03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:18.170 align:start position:0%
you said is making me feel the need to
ask

03:36:18.170 --> 03:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would do nothing to take Vital
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
Records away from the Secretary of State
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
and put them in Health and Human
 
03:36:25.849 --> 03:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
Services is that correct that is correct
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
03:36:32.570 --> 03:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Horrigan
 
03:36:36.889 --> 03:36:36.899 align:start position:0%
admit and um you mentioned um 10 percent
 
03:36:39.530 --> 03:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
of uh 10 of the babies that are born in
 
03:36:41.330 --> 03:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospitals or to mothers
 
03:36:43.370 --> 03:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
who live in other states I assume
 
03:36:45.889 --> 03:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
probably and um conversely ten percent
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
Brothers in New Hampshire giving birth
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
to babies and uh
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
in others outside New Hampshire and I
 
03:36:55.370 --> 03:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
assume that's probably predominantly
 
03:36:58.130 --> 03:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts and Maine so what
 
03:36:58.140 --> 03:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts and Maine so what
are

03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:37:00.769 --> 03:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
what data do those three states
 
03:37:04.010 --> 03:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
routinely correct is it similar to this
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question
 
03:37:07.010 --> 03:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative there's a there's a
 
03:37:08.809 --> 03:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
Android set of questions that all 50
 
03:37:11.570 --> 03:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
states ask and so that is the way that
 
03:37:13.130 --> 03:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
we can have inter-jurisdictional
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
exchange so again I can I can have my
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
baby in Massachusetts if I'm a New
 
03:37:19.070 --> 03:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident or a Vermont
 
03:37:21.710 --> 03:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
individual can come to New Hampshire and
 
03:37:23.090 --> 03:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
have their baby at Dartmouth or
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
03:37:26.210 --> 03:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
um it's critically important that there
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
is a standard we work close the
 
03:37:30.050 --> 03:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office Works
 
03:37:31.670 --> 03:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
closely with the national Center for
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
Health statistics to make sure that no
 
03:37:35.570 --> 03:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
matter where you're born in the U.S you
 
03:37:37.729 --> 03:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
have the same level of information
 
03:37:41.389 --> 03:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's provided within the birth record
 
03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Gould you have a
 
03:37:45.229 --> 03:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
quick question it's very quick
 
03:37:45.239 --> 03:37:46.010 align:start position:0%
quick question it's very quick
um

03:37:46.010 --> 03:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:49.490 --> 03:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
is do the hospitals fill these out and
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
paper and then somebody does data entry
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
or they entered electronically it is
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
primarily an electronic system now I'm
 
03:37:57.170 --> 03:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
not probably the best to represent
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens at the bedside in
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
the hospital but it is primarily an
 
03:38:03.290 --> 03:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
electronic system thank you okay thank
 
03:38:03.300 --> 03:38:04.070 align:start position:0%
electronic system thank you okay thank
you

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:38:06.290 --> 03:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
 
03:38:06.300 --> 03:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
testimony

03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:38:29.630 --> 03:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.090 --> 03:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'm Janet Perkins Holland I'm an OB GYN
 
03:38:35.090 --> 03:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
at Wentworth Douglas hospital I've had
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
the great honor of working there for
 
03:38:42.110 --> 03:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
um upwards of 25 years and delivering
 
03:38:44.090 --> 03:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
several thousand babies in the great
 
03:38:45.769 --> 03:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
03:38:45.779 --> 03:38:46.550 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
um

03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I am not speaking for my hospital
 
03:38:53.330 --> 03:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
today I also am a proud member of the
 
03:38:55.610 --> 03:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Medical Society and
 
03:38:57.050 --> 03:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
I believe that my testimony is in
 
03:38:59.330 --> 03:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
agreement with their stance
 
03:38:59.340 --> 03:38:59.929 align:start position:0%
agreement with their stance
um

03:38:59.929 --> 03:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
I as several people have mentioned for
 
03:39:05.050 --> 03:39:05.060 align:start position:0%
section one
 
03:39:09.650 --> 03:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
I am in favor of the idea of removing
 
03:39:12.050 --> 03:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
um for these type of things I'm always
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of removing criminal penalties
 
03:39:20.170 --> 03:39:20.180 align:start position:0%
for people who give birth
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
and that is in the context of supporting
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
um people I think we're all want to
 
03:39:28.490 --> 03:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
support women or people who give birth
 
03:39:33.650 --> 03:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
in our state section two I think is the
 
03:39:37.330 --> 03:39:37.340 align:start position:0%
problematic part the
 
03:39:41.510 --> 03:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
intent may be good but the impact is
 
03:39:44.450 --> 03:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
definitely not I think that it is
 
03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:46.309 align:start position:0%
definitely not I think that it is
absolutely

03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:39:46.319 --> 03:39:46.969 align:start position:0%
absolutely
um

03:39:46.969 --> 03:39:46.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:50.269 --> 03:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
possible to believe in the principles of
 
03:39:50.279 --> 03:39:51.830 align:start position:0%
possible to believe in the principles of
privacy

03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
and autonomy
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
reproductive feed Freedom HIPAA
 
03:39:58.969 --> 03:39:58.979 align:start position:0%
compliance all these things that have
 
03:40:02.570 --> 03:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
been mentioned and also be in Stark
 
03:40:05.450 --> 03:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
opposition to section
 
03:40:07.330 --> 03:40:07.340 align:start position:0%
um two of this bill
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
I want just want to highlight the uh the
 
03:40:14.570 --> 03:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
importance of communication and the
 
03:40:18.710 --> 03:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
communication that is bi-directional the
 
03:40:22.090 --> 03:40:22.100 align:start position:0%
safety of our patients is deeply
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
important to me and hopefully to
 
03:40:27.290 --> 03:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
but there is a relationship between the
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
patient and the care providers the whole
 
03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:36.779 align:start position:0%
everybody that is uh
 
03:40:38.450 --> 03:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and the staff of the hospital or
 
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
providing care to the to the people who
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
give birth and also for the community
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
um so this information that we're
 
03:40:50.090 --> 03:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
getting is not just interesting but also
 
03:40:52.849 --> 03:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
impactful and it's impactful in uh both
 
03:40:56.330 --> 03:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
a retrospective way and a proactive way
 
03:41:00.769 --> 03:41:00.779 align:start position:0%
I've um had the uh honor of being on the
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality Review Board in New
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we go in great detail off
 
03:41:07.610 --> 03:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
this the data that we receive from the
 
03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
birth certificates about what
 
03:41:15.769 --> 03:41:15.779 align:start position:0%
um is had is related to somebody's birth
 
03:41:18.830 --> 03:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think it is you might be
 
03:41:20.750 --> 03:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
surprised at
 
03:41:20.760 --> 03:41:22.130 align:start position:0%
surprised at
um

03:41:22.130 --> 03:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
how the relationship between some of
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
these birth some of these uh Health
 
03:41:30.530 --> 03:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
um things like smoking or IVF or
 
03:41:33.170 --> 03:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
anything is actually related substance
 
03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
use disorder is related to uh the the
 
03:41:40.370 --> 03:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
outcomes the poor outcomes
 
03:41:44.929 --> 03:41:44.939 align:start position:0%
um one just a brief example is
 
03:41:47.389 --> 03:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire prams
 
03:41:49.370 --> 03:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
um which is the pregnancy New Hampshire
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
pregnancy risk assessment monitoring
 
03:41:53.929 --> 03:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
system is funded by the CDC
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and this is
 
03:41:58.250 --> 03:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
information that we can't get from
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
billing data this is information that
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
the uh is is taken from random sampling
 
03:42:08.450 --> 03:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
of the birth certificates and it is
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
gives us information about maternal
 
03:42:11.809 --> 03:42:11.819 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
preconceptual Health as well but
 
03:42:16.010 --> 03:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
maternal mental health and so I'm deeply
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about the taking away
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
something like prams because this is
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
where we get our data about something
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
like postpartum depression and I think I
 
03:42:25.610 --> 03:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
probably don't have to tell people in
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
this room about what the impacts of
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression is so I think this
 
03:42:30.359 --> 03:42:31.670 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression is so I think this
the

03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:34.490 --> 03:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
um section 2 of this bill is incredibly
 
03:42:37.090 --> 03:42:37.100 align:start position:0%
problematic in terms of
 
03:42:39.729 --> 03:42:39.739 align:start position:0%
preventing us from improving outcomes
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
and informing quality and safety
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
programs at our hospital and across our
 
03:42:47.929 --> 03:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
state it's harmful so thank you very
 
03:42:47.939 --> 03:42:49.130 align:start position:0%
state it's harmful so thank you very
much

03:42:49.130 --> 03:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:42:52.370 --> 03:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:43:06.969 --> 03:43:06.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.650 --> 03:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and honorable
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%

kenniston I am the new State Registrar
 
03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:15.239 align:start position:0%

03:43:17.220 --> 03:43:18.710 align:start position:0%
me so I get to come in and chat with
everybody

03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:43:21.170 --> 03:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
um just to put you at ease I was the
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
city clerk in Lebanon for three years
 
03:43:25.250 --> 03:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
and prior to that for the prior 12 years
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
I was in that office for staff
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
um so I have 15 years of Vital Records
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
experience before coming into this
 
03:43:34.910 --> 03:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
position joining me today is Trisha
 
03:43:37.849 --> 03:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
pietzsu she was the acting registrar for
 
03:43:40.729 --> 03:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
Vital Records and is also the director
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
of the elections office and she also
 
03:43:45.889 --> 03:43:45.899 align:start position:0%
brings to the table 25 years of city
 
03:43:47.450 --> 03:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
clerk's experience dealing with Vital
 
03:43:47.460 --> 03:43:48.650 align:start position:0%
clerk's experience dealing with Vital
Records

03:43:48.650 --> 03:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
Records
 
03:43:51.290 --> 03:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
and we also have David Scanlon here with
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
the secretary who is the Secretary of
 
03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:53.889 align:start position:0%
the secretary who is the Secretary of
State

03:43:53.889 --> 03:43:53.899 align:start position:0%
State
 
03:43:56.210 --> 03:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
so our office is not taking a position
 
03:43:58.670 --> 03:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
on this legislation we do believe this
 
03:44:01.250 --> 03:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
is a policy decision for you to make but
 
03:44:04.130 --> 03:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
we want to bring to your attention
 
03:44:05.690 --> 03:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
um some of the unintended consequences
 
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
that this could have not only for the
 
03:44:10.190 --> 03:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records but also for
 
03:44:11.929 --> 03:44:11.939 align:start position:0%
the constituents in the state of New
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are going to have children
 
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
um so just starting on the first section
 
03:44:19.130 --> 03:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
um I think you've already heard enough
 
03:44:21.650 --> 03:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding the um the felony
 
03:44:23.210 --> 03:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
Provisions we don't have anything to
 
03:44:24.889 --> 03:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
offer on that it doesn't affect the
 
03:44:26.929 --> 03:44:26.939 align:start position:0%
birth certificate nor does it affect the
 
03:44:28.370 --> 03:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
Social Security side of things so we're
 
03:44:31.610 --> 03:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
not going to offer any suggestions there
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
um section two which as you can see is
 
03:44:37.729 --> 03:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
having the most Focus if you look at
 
03:44:40.550 --> 03:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed it's striking the
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
child's name and the parents names and
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
their information
 
03:44:48.170 --> 03:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
that is the information that is used to
 
03:44:50.690 --> 03:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
create the actual birth certificate so
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
by striking that information from that
 
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
worksheet we can now no longer create
 
03:44:57.410 --> 03:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
birth certificates
 
03:44:58.849 --> 03:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
03:45:01.490 --> 03:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
could be problematic to our constituents
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
So currently what happens is that
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
paperwork is filled out at the hospital
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
and if I'm remembering correctly 19
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
years ago I did the Green Sheet when I
 
03:45:11.150 --> 03:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
had my daughter and then the hospital
 
03:45:13.450 --> 03:45:13.460 align:start position:0%
staff worked with me on the rest of it
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at it there are a lot of
 
03:45:19.010 --> 03:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
boxes that say unknown and so that tells
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
me that you don't necessarily have to
 
03:45:22.670 --> 03:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
provide that information
 
03:45:25.490 --> 03:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
that form once it's completed is taken
 
03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
to the birth registers at the hospital
 
03:45:29.450 --> 03:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
and then they key it into a system known
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
as nevren the neverend database is what
 
03:45:33.530 --> 03:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
houses all of our Vital Records and and
 
03:45:35.870 --> 03:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
the vital records statistics
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
um that is when the parents go to the
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
clerk's office to obtain a certified
 
03:45:42.830 --> 03:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
copy of that birth record that's the at
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
the database that they're accessing to
 
03:45:46.610 --> 03:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
create that record
 
03:45:46.620 --> 03:45:47.929 align:start position:0%
create that record
so

03:45:47.929 --> 03:45:47.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:50.210 --> 03:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
what's happening now is when the
 
03:45:52.370 --> 03:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
registrar creates the record they issue
 
03:45:53.929 --> 03:45:53.939 align:start position:0%
something that's called a parent notice
 
03:45:55.729 --> 03:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
which does two things that sends the
 
03:45:57.530 --> 03:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
parent notice to the parent who's on
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
file so that they can get a preview of
 
03:46:00.889 --> 03:46:00.899 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate make sure there's
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
no spelling errors because that does
 
03:46:04.610 --> 03:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
happen it also tells them that that
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
birth record is available and they can
 
03:46:08.690 --> 03:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
go and purchase a copy of it and because
 
03:46:11.570 --> 03:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
of the way our system works up to as far
 
03:46:14.210 --> 03:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
back as 1935 is available anywhere in
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so if I had a
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
complication and I had to go an hour
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
away to a hospital I might not
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to go back to that
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
clerk's office to use or to obtain my
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
certified copy so I could go right down
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
to my own clerk's office and obtain it
 
03:46:33.170 --> 03:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
but what's going to happen now is when
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
they key on the information at the
 
03:46:36.050 --> 03:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
hospital because they still have to
 
03:46:37.190 --> 03:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
account for this other information
 
03:46:39.889 --> 03:46:39.899 align:start position:0%
that's requiring to be captured the
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
child's name is now going to be entered
 
03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
as baby boy or baby girl the last name
 
03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
will be put in as unknown
 
03:46:47.450 --> 03:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
the parents will all going to be either
 
03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
unknown or not stated so the only
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
identifiable part that's going to show
 
03:46:54.110 --> 03:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
up in that never database for your local
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
clerk to pull up is going to be the date
 
03:46:58.490 --> 03:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
of birth the time of birth and the
 
03:47:01.190 --> 03:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
location which as you can tell there's
 
03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to identify that that's even the
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
correct record for the people that are
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
requesting it
 
03:47:10.150 --> 03:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's also going to require that the
 
03:47:13.309 --> 03:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
parents go to the clerk's office where
 
03:47:16.190 --> 03:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
the event occurred to make any revisions
 
03:47:18.170 --> 03:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
so that's where they're going to go and
 
03:47:20.090 --> 03:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
assign a name to their child that's
 
03:47:21.650 --> 03:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
where they're going to go and have to
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
prove that they are the parents of that
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
child for the record
 
03:47:29.150 --> 03:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
which brings us to another tricky point
 
03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:30.110 align:start position:0%
which brings us to another tricky point
where

03:47:30.110 --> 03:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
first of all how does the clerk even
 
03:47:33.290 --> 03:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
identify that they have the correct
 
03:47:34.969 --> 03:47:34.979 align:start position:0%
correct child's record before they start
 
03:47:37.070 --> 03:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
just making amendments to it and second
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
of all how do you know the person in
 
03:47:41.330 --> 03:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
front of you is the correct person that
 
03:47:42.530 --> 03:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
should have access to that record
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
because they might have given me photo
 
03:47:46.610 --> 03:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
identification but what can I match that
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
to so that's um that's something that
 
03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
um the the cost for amendments too so
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
the amendment process itself can
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually be if it's within the first 14
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
days of it being filed it's relatively
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
simple but once you get past that 14
 
03:48:08.210 --> 03:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
days up to six months it's a ten dollar
 
03:48:10.010 --> 03:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
fee so now it's we're incurring a cost
 
03:48:13.130 --> 03:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
to the constituents and they have to
 
03:48:15.170 --> 03:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
come up with um they might have to come
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
up with some proofs and that's generally
 
03:48:18.590 --> 03:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
not but they would still have to go in
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
fill out the form present their photo
 
03:48:22.250 --> 03:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
IDs it's going to create something
 
03:48:23.690 --> 03:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
called a marginal note on that record
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
and that marginal note stays on the
 
03:48:27.229 --> 03:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
record forever and it just shows that
 
03:48:28.610 --> 03:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
while these amendments had to be made to
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
the record because everything previously
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
said unknown or not stated
 
03:48:35.090 --> 03:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
after you hit the six month mark it
 
03:48:37.370 --> 03:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
becomes much more complicated because
 
03:48:40.490 --> 03:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
people have to provide proofs of what
 
03:48:42.349 --> 03:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
the corrections are to be made and every
 
03:48:43.969 --> 03:48:43.979 align:start position:0%
correction that they're making so the
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
parents names the child's names places
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
of birth is going to require two pieces
 
03:48:51.290 --> 03:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
of proof to prove that that's what the
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
information should actually be so it
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
does become quite a process for the
 
03:48:57.050 --> 03:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
parents if they're not able to get
 
03:48:58.969 --> 03:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
directly in there so if there was a
 
03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
complication that prevented them from
 
03:49:03.650 --> 03:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
showing up they might not go in until
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
that six month Mark and then they're
 
03:49:07.190 --> 03:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to have all of all of those
 
03:49:09.769 --> 03:49:09.779 align:start position:0%
corrections to have to make
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the um did I miss anything else on
 
03:49:17.330 --> 03:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so again the correction
 
03:49:21.050 --> 03:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
procedure is the local clerk where the
 
03:49:22.969 --> 03:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
event occurred so there's only so many
 
03:49:25.130 --> 03:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
clerks in the state where
 
03:49:28.130 --> 03:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
um we have birthing centers really
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
so they would have to go there which is
 
03:49:31.370 --> 03:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
going to be an influx on the local
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal resources that it takes a
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
while it can take up to about 10 to 20
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
minutes depending on how complicated the
 
03:49:39.769 --> 03:49:39.779 align:start position:0%
correction can be
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
so then um the other thing that we were
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
looking at was Social Security
 
03:49:46.210 --> 03:49:46.220 align:start position:0%
Administration so because
 
03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
DHHS has already touched on this I won't
 
03:49:50.570 --> 03:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
go too much into it but now we do not
 
03:49:52.969 --> 03:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
have this information to supply the
 
03:49:55.610 --> 03:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
social security so now the parents are
 
03:49:57.650 --> 03:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
going to have to go in get their record
 
03:50:00.830 --> 03:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
amended purchase the certified copy and
 
03:50:02.690 --> 03:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
then do it the manual way to get their
 
03:50:04.370 --> 03:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
social security cards issued for their
 
03:50:06.769 --> 03:50:06.779 align:start position:0%
children either by mailing it in or
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
showing up in person to do this at the
 
03:50:11.450 --> 03:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
Social Security offices right now you
 
03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
just check a box and if you say yes I
 
03:50:14.809 --> 03:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
want it to go the parents are going to
 
03:50:16.010 --> 03:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
get that Social Security card in the
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
mail within a few weeks usually a month
 
03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
so that is now creating that hardship
 
03:50:22.250 --> 03:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
for the parents
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
in 2022 just so you know we had over 12
 
03:50:27.410 --> 03:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
000 children that were born of those
 
03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
over the 12 000 people only 52 didn't
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
request a Birthright or excuse me a
 
03:50:34.130 --> 03:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
social security number for their child
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
and that could be because they didn't
 
03:50:38.210 --> 03:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
agree on a name so they did just name
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
their child baby boy or baby girl or
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
something happened with the filing that
 
03:50:45.530 --> 03:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
prevented them from um doing the social
 
03:50:48.650 --> 03:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
and it'll also cause some confusion for
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
the parents as well so if you have
 
03:50:56.929 --> 03:50:56.939 align:start position:0%
people that have had previous children
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
before now all of a sudden they're not
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
getting their social security cards in
 
03:51:02.570 --> 03:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
the mail they're not getting that parent
 
03:51:05.450 --> 03:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
notice they're expecting that now so now
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
they won't be having that
 
03:51:09.050 --> 03:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
is there anything else you can think of
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
to add on that section
 
03:51:10.439 --> 03:51:13.429 align:start position:0%
to add on that section
okay

03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.050 --> 03:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
um so then the third and final section
 
03:51:17.330 --> 03:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
that we just want to touch on was the
 
03:51:19.610 --> 03:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
records retention for maintaining those
 
03:51:22.429 --> 03:51:22.439 align:start position:0%
birth worksheets so the worksheets are
 
03:51:23.809 --> 03:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
actually maintained by the hospital we
 
03:51:25.490 --> 03:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't get them at all and so right now
 
03:51:27.650 --> 03:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's to maintain them permanently at the
 
03:51:30.410 --> 03:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
hospital we don't have any um any
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that these aren't being kept
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
permanently our recommendation though is
 
03:51:36.530 --> 03:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
to at least ask them to keep them for
 
03:51:38.809 --> 03:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
seven years and our reason for that is
 
03:51:40.190 --> 03:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
because there is something in the state
 
03:51:41.450 --> 03:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
called a delayed birth we're actually
 
03:51:42.889 --> 03:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
dealing with quite a few of them right
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
now so if a child is born in a hospital
 
03:51:47.690 --> 03:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
and it's been more than a year and it we
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
find out oh no the child's information
 
03:51:52.370 --> 03:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
was never input into neverend
 
03:51:53.929 --> 03:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
um they have to file a delayed birth
 
03:51:56.450 --> 03:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
they have to come up with proofs of this
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
child actually being born it's it's four
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
proofs and one of the proofs that's
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
obviously a very good proof to have is
 
03:52:05.090 --> 03:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
this document right here so that's why
 
03:52:06.650 --> 03:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
we're just maintaining we recommend
 
03:52:09.889 --> 03:52:09.899 align:start position:0%
seven to maintain because most people if
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
they don't get their birth records raid
 
03:52:12.889 --> 03:52:12.899 align:start position:0%
off they do it when they register
 
03:52:15.410 --> 03:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
children for school so seven years seem
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:22.969 --> 03:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
um as far as any costs uh is for the
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
legislation it's it's kind of minimum on
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
our department
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
um the bill doesn't appropriate any
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
funds for the implementation nor are
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
these costs included in the budget
 
03:52:33.050 --> 03:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
passed by the house uh there would be a
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
one-time cost approximately of a hundred
 
03:52:37.130 --> 03:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
and thousand dollars for system changes
 
03:52:38.690 --> 03:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
that would be needed within the neverend
 
03:52:38.700 --> 03:52:39.469 align:start position:0%
that would be needed within the neverend
system

03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
and then with various contracts and
 
03:52:44.570 --> 03:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
agreements with entities such as the CDC
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
and the Social Security we receive
 
03:52:49.490 --> 03:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
roughly 160 000 a year for reporting
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
that information
 
03:52:53.570 --> 03:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
the CDC uses the birth data each state
 
03:52:55.670 --> 03:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
provides to analyze Trends Trends
 
03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
Nationwide all states provide this
 
03:52:59.330 --> 03:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
information these funds are used to
 
03:53:00.889 --> 03:53:00.899 align:start position:0%
support the operations of our divisions
 
03:53:02.450 --> 03:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
and would need to be replaced with the
 
03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
general funds so there might be a
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
position say that's partially funded or
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
fully funded by these funds that are
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
coming in and that person is still going
 
03:53:11.389 --> 03:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
to stay on with the division now we have
 
03:53:12.889 --> 03:53:12.899 align:start position:0%
to come up with the funds to keep them
 
03:53:12.899 --> 03:53:14.389 align:start position:0%
to come up with the funds to keep them
on

03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that is the end of my testimony does
 
03:53:20.530 --> 03:53:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:23.929 --> 03:53:23.939 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmitz
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
so it seems like we're going to have a
 
03:53:28.250 --> 03:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I hope you'll be
 
03:53:30.650 --> 03:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
available for the subcommittee
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
um what happens with uh people who have
 
03:53:37.610 --> 03:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
home births or to use doulas in some
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a non-hospital situation all
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
these records and all this data has to
 
03:53:46.849 --> 03:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
be obtained and how does how does that
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
happen so that does not be appear to be
 
03:53:52.610 --> 03:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
affected At All by this bill but it's
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
essentially the same way the midwives
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
are given the exact same worksheets and
 
03:53:58.910 --> 03:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
then that information is used by our
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
department to key the record on to the
 
03:54:00.960 --> 03:54:01.790 align:start position:0%
department to key the record on to the
system

03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:54:04.190 --> 03:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
because there isn't a birth registrar to
 
03:54:07.010 --> 03:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
do that cover that representative Gould
 
03:54:08.510 --> 03:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Sharon thank you for
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:54:10.680 --> 03:54:12.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:54:12.110 --> 03:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned keeping the green form
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
for seven years if the parents don't
 
03:54:18.290 --> 03:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
request the birth certificate at the
 
03:54:20.050 --> 03:54:20.060 align:start position:0%
time the child is born is that correct
 
03:54:23.150 --> 03:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
well just to clarify I'm recommending
 
03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals still have to keep
 
03:54:27.170 --> 03:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
them so that there is a backup just in
 
03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
case they are not aware that the record
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't filed they might not become aware
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
um until they go to get the copy to
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
register the children for school so the
 
03:54:38.450 --> 03:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
seven years was that kind of window
 
03:54:41.150 --> 03:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
where we thought yep so they meaning the
 
03:54:43.130 --> 03:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
parents might not be aware yeah so my
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:54:48.170 --> 03:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
the green if the hospital doesn't keep
 
03:54:51.050 --> 03:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
the green form and the parents did not
 
03:54:53.210 --> 03:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
ask for the birth certificate the data
 
03:54:55.010 --> 03:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
no longer exists it didn't get entered
 
03:54:57.170 --> 03:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
into the system we would then have to
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
file something I called a delayed birth
 
03:55:01.510 --> 03:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
which is a completely different
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
process and no the data never enters the
 
03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
neverend system at that point it's a
 
03:55:08.150 --> 03:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's a manual process that we have to go
 
03:55:10.130 --> 03:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
through at the local Clerk's level and
 
03:55:12.590 --> 03:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
then with us okay so I'm a genealogist
 
03:55:14.750 --> 03:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
too sorry I understand all the delayed
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
stuff so the the issue is
 
03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
the hospital fills out the form but if
 
03:55:21.769 --> 03:55:21.779 align:start position:0%
the parent doesn't want the birth
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
certificate at the time of birth then
 
03:55:26.210 --> 03:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
the information the data from the sheet
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
never gets entered into the data no it's
 
03:55:29.210 --> 03:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
not that the parent doesn't want it it's
 
03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
that an error occurred so that they they
 
03:55:33.769 --> 03:55:33.779 align:start position:0%
might have just made an error and
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
thought they keyed it into the system
 
03:55:37.370 --> 03:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
and okay I gotcha thank you
 
03:55:39.290 --> 03:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
yes hey
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
I think yes representative true
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:55:45.889 --> 03:55:45.899 align:start position:0%
when I was born they just chiseled the
 
03:55:50.330 --> 03:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
things into the into the concrete who
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
who issues the birth certificate in New
 
03:55:52.560 --> 03:55:53.210 align:start position:0%
who issues the birth certificate in New
Hampshire

03:55:53.210 --> 03:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
so it comes out of the neverend system
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
it can either be issued by my department
 
03:55:58.729 --> 03:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
the division of Vital Records or it can
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
be issued from your local clerk City
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
Clerk or town clerk
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam JS so
 
03:56:09.530 --> 03:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
if the information from the Green Sheet
 
03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
is forwarded to your office without the
 
03:56:14.150 --> 03:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
name and address
 
03:56:16.729 --> 03:56:16.739 align:start position:0%
you can't do the birth certificate so
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
what it is it's the birth registrar at
 
03:56:21.229 --> 03:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
the hospital they won't have that data
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
to enter it into the database that we
 
03:56:26.090 --> 03:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
then can retrieve the record with
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this will
 
03:56:35.450 --> 03:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
be going to subcommittee uh
 
03:56:39.050 --> 03:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative grotis subcommittee and I
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
trust that the HHS and Vital Records
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
will work with us
 
03:56:46.429 --> 03:56:46.439 align:start position:0%
as we meet
 
03:56:49.790 --> 03:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to only ask the
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who have signed up to speak
 
03:56:54.590 --> 03:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
rather not anymore from the agency
 
03:56:58.729 --> 03:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
because I think we've gotten a flood of
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
data from them
 
03:57:00.479 --> 03:57:01.610 align:start position:0%
data from them
so

03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:22.370 --> 03:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and committee
 
03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
members my name is Kaylee Crockett and
 
03:57:30.769 --> 03:57:30.779 align:start position:0%
I'm David Boone and we are here today to
 
03:57:35.389 --> 03:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
tell you about our unique experiences
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
um that our family has had with the
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
newborn screener
 
03:57:41.570 --> 03:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
so please you you'll have to get closer
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
to the microphone and speak a little
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
louder I apologize um we're here to tell
 
03:57:46.910 --> 03:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
you about our you our family's unique
 
03:57:49.370 --> 03:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
experiences with the newborn screener
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
on October 21st 2021 we received a phone
 
03:57:54.769 --> 03:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
call that our eight day old Son Nolan
 
03:57:56.689 --> 03:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
had been flagged for a genetic condition
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
that could be potentially fatal we were
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
told that the condition was called mps1
 
03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
which was short for
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 a genetic
 
03:58:06.650 --> 03:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
condition that is so rare that most
 
03:58:09.530 --> 03:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
Physicians do not know about it and in
 
03:58:11.809 --> 03:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
our state we do not even have a doctor
 
03:58:14.809 --> 03:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
that treats it Nolan was born into an
 
03:58:16.849 --> 03:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
incredibly unique situation
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
his form of mps1 affects one in five
 
03:58:22.189 --> 03:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand births and is known as
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
Shea syndrome the mutation that makes up
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
his condition
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
has only been documented once before and
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
that person was not diagnosed until she
 
03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
was in her 20s
 
03:58:33.410 --> 03:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
he is the only person in the world to
 
03:58:36.650 --> 03:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
ever be diagnosed with his form of mps1
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
prior to the form of on I'm sorry prior
 
03:58:41.210 --> 03:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
to the onset of symptoms and therefore
 
03:58:43.849 --> 03:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
prior to needing any sort of treatment
 
03:58:46.490 --> 03:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
additionally not only is he the only
 
03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
person to be identified with mps1 in New
 
03:58:51.170 --> 03:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by the newborn screener he is
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
also the only person to even be flagged
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
by as potentially having it in our state
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
when we received the call in October of
 
03:59:01.550 --> 03:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
2021 we had been told that we needed to
 
03:59:02.809 --> 03:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
get our child to Boston Children's
 
03:59:04.610 --> 03:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
Hospital for further testing the next
 
03:59:04.620 --> 03:59:06.170 align:start position:0%
Hospital for further testing the next
morning

03:59:06.170 --> 03:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
they had already set up our appointment
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
for us we just needed to go down and see
 
03:59:11.689 --> 03:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
what our next steps would be
 
03:59:13.849 --> 03:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
after completing several confirmatory
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
tests it was determined that our son did
 
03:59:18.769 --> 03:59:18.779 align:start position:0%
in fact have the least severe form of
 
03:59:18.779 --> 03:59:21.349 align:start position:0%
in fact have the least severe form of
mps1

03:59:21.349 --> 03:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
mps1
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
where Nolan has such a mild form of the
 
03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
condition he doesn't have any visible
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
signs nor does he have any symptoms of
 
03:59:29.510 --> 03:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
the condition currently
 
03:59:32.210 --> 03:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
Nolan has six percent of his enzyme
 
03:59:34.189 --> 03:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
level working this has allowed him to
 
03:59:35.809 --> 03:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
break down enough of the complex sugar
 
03:59:38.090 --> 03:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
chains and clear his body of the waste
 
03:59:39.650 --> 03:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
thus allowing him to not need any
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
treatments currently
 
03:59:44.330 --> 03:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
eventually his body will not be able to
 
03:59:46.490 --> 03:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
keep up and his marginal enzyme level
 
03:59:48.769 --> 03:59:48.779 align:start position:0%
will stop working causing him to need
 
03:59:50.689 --> 03:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
weekly treatments for the debrision of
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
his lifetime
 
03:59:55.969 --> 03:59:55.979 align:start position:0%
since Nolan was identified to have MPS
 
03:59:58.250 --> 03:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
via the newborn screener we are very
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
fortunate to bring him to Boston several
 
04:00:02.570 --> 04:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
times a year to have his levels tested
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
so that they can monitor when he will
 
04:00:06.889 --> 04:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
need to begin his treatment the goal is
 
04:00:08.450 --> 04:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
to have him begin treatment when his
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
enzyme level Falls to a level that is
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
not producing enough
 
04:00:14.929 --> 04:00:14.939 align:start position:0%
um that he is not producing enough but
 
04:00:17.570 --> 04:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
is not yet harmful to him
 
04:00:19.490 --> 04:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
had no one not been identified on the
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
newborn screener he would have spent
 
04:00:22.250 --> 04:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
years in and out of different
 
04:00:23.870 --> 04:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
Specialists trying to determine the
 
04:00:25.370 --> 04:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind an array of symptoms
 
04:00:27.650 --> 04:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
the buildup of waste would have caused
 
04:00:27.660 --> 04:00:29.269 align:start position:0%
the buildup of waste would have caused
him

04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
by the time that a diagnosis was made
 
04:00:33.290 --> 04:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
the damage already would have been done
 
04:00:35.570 --> 04:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately there is nothing that
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
they can do to revert it at that point
 
04:00:40.250 --> 04:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
to reverse it at that point they can
 
04:00:43.250 --> 04:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
just treat it from becoming worse
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
across the country mps1 is not something
 
04:00:47.689 --> 04:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
that is universally tested for on the
 
04:00:50.150 --> 04:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
newborn screener the MPS Community is
 
04:00:52.130 --> 04:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
quite small and we often hear of
 
04:00:53.570 --> 04:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
children that are not identified as
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
having the condition until they have
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
already started developing irreversible
 
04:00:56.760 --> 04:00:58.130 align:start position:0%
already started developing irreversible
symptoms

04:00:58.130 --> 04:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
taking identifiable information off the
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
newborn screener will make it that much
 
04:01:03.530 --> 04:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
more difficult to track families and
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
inform them in instances where their
 
04:01:07.250 --> 04:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
child could have potentially fatal
 
04:01:09.170 --> 04:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
genetic conditions
 
04:01:11.330 --> 04:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
at eight days old Nolan's life was
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
forever changed in being flagged by this
 
04:01:13.199 --> 04:01:14.269 align:start position:0%
forever changed in being flagged by this
condition

04:01:14.269 --> 04:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we are forever grateful that we
 
04:01:17.689 --> 04:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
received this call and are able to
 
04:01:20.150 --> 04:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
provide him the necessary treatments
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
it is our hope that you consider not
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
making any changes to how information is
 
04:01:25.969 --> 04:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
shared with the newborn screener so that
 
04:01:28.130 --> 04:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
more families like ours are able to
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide their children with the best
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
possible outcomes in the timeliest of
 
04:01:34.010 --> 04:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
manners thank you for your time thank
 
04:01:35.689 --> 04:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony are there any
 
04:01:35.699 --> 04:01:37.250 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony are there any
questions

04:01:37.250 --> 04:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:01:38.689 --> 04:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:01:45.170 --> 04:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.689 --> 04:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.699 --> 04:02:01.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
okay

04:02:06.960 --> 04:02:08.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:08.110 --> 04:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:10.370 --> 04:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
she gave us her testimony thank you
 
04:02:13.370 --> 04:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
we'll take that in lieu of the speech
 
04:02:17.809 --> 04:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
Dustin Madam chair one moment um we did
 
04:02:19.849 --> 04:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
not receive enough copies from Lucy
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
hotter I'll tell we will get more the
 
04:02:24.410 --> 04:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
committee members on this side that need
 
04:02:26.570 --> 04:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
to ask we will make sure we get more
 
04:02:26.580 --> 04:02:30.110 align:start position:0%
to ask we will make sure we get more
copies

04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.010 --> 04:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is deo Danae
 
04:02:40.429 --> 04:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
Dustin botterey
 
04:02:41.689 --> 04:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:02:43.849 --> 04:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
am a little intimidated surrounding by
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
all surrounded by all the experts I am
 
04:02:47.330 --> 04:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
also just speaking as a parent of a
 
04:02:49.610 --> 04:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
child with a disability
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
I was born and raised in Kentucky I now
 
04:02:54.050 --> 04:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
own a home and live in Concord we're
 
04:02:55.849 --> 04:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
raising our two children there
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to oppose this bill I
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
want to address one program that will be
 
04:03:03.769 --> 04:03:03.779 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by section two and
 
04:03:06.530 --> 04:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
that is the newborn screening program
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
our eight-year-old son has spinal
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
muscular atrophy SMA this is a
 
04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
degenerative neuromuscular disorder that
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
causes his muscles to be very weak and
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
he navigates the world using a
 
04:03:18.120 --> 04:03:19.189 align:start position:0%
he navigates the world using a
wheelchair

04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
wheelchair
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
he's an amazing kid our son's diagnosis
 
04:03:24.650 --> 04:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
was delayed for months because when he
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
was born New Hampshire was not screening
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
for SMA and his newborn screening and so
 
04:03:33.170 --> 04:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
onset of symptoms occurred
 
04:03:35.090 --> 04:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
had he been born in Massachusetts where
 
04:03:37.610 --> 04:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
we they were screening for SMA he could
 
04:03:38.650 --> 04:03:38.660 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
identified and treated right away and he
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
likely like other children
 
04:03:46.490 --> 04:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
um who are
 
04:03:48.530 --> 04:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
screened and treated before symptom
 
04:03:50.689 --> 04:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
onset would not be using a wheelchair
 
04:03:50.699 --> 04:03:52.070 align:start position:0%
onset would not be using a wheelchair
today

04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:03:52.080 --> 04:03:54.050 align:start position:0%
today
however

04:03:54.050 --> 04:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:03:56.450 --> 04:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
um after my son was finally diagnosed
 
04:03:58.250 --> 04:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
after his first birthday I began a
 
04:04:00.650 --> 04:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
years-long effort to have SMA added to
 
04:04:02.689 --> 04:04:02.699 align:start position:0%
the newborn screening panel here in New
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I can happily say that it
 
04:04:08.929 --> 04:04:08.939 align:start position:0%
has been and that every baby born in New
 
04:04:11.210 --> 04:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the last couple years is
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
screened for SMA is quickly within a
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
matter of days
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
given confirmatory Diagnostics and
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
those who
 
04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
um so if you pass this bill the
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
department will no longer be able to
 
04:04:32.330 --> 04:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
match the newborn screening data daily
 
04:04:35.210 --> 04:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
with the vital records necessary so that
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
this time sensitive follow-up can
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
continue to occur and it this bill in
 
04:04:44.330 --> 04:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
that way undermines the critical mission
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
for example so it would cause families
 
04:04:57.410 --> 04:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
so to wait for results and then that
 
04:04:59.929 --> 04:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
weight could have dire consequences and
 
04:05:01.969 --> 04:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
for example children who receive
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
treatment for SMA prior to symptom onset
 
04:05:06.650 --> 04:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
are walking running and playing with
 
04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
their friends
 
04:05:11.030 --> 04:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
children like mine navigate the world
 
04:05:13.370 --> 04:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
with a wheelchair but that is the least
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the medical interventions that he
 
04:05:18.650 --> 04:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between timely diagnosis
 
04:05:24.769 --> 04:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
through newborn screening and are very
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
successful program here
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
and the lack of this notification cannot
 
04:05:33.050 --> 04:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
please do not pass this bill is written
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's a solution and want of a problem
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to newborn screening
 
04:05:43.729 --> 04:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
program which will be affected the
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
newborn screening program works and
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
parents who have concerns around privacy
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
regarding the newborn screening program
 
04:05:52.490 --> 04:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
come opt out it's not a mandatory
 
04:05:52.500 --> 04:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
come opt out it's not a mandatory
program

04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:05:55.729 --> 04:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
but please don't undermine the
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of such an amazing
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
life-saving program
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
for the majority of Granite State
 
04:06:03.710 --> 04:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
families who rely on it
 
04:06:05.090 --> 04:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:06:09.410 --> 04:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
regarding that small aspect of this bill
 
04:06:11.210 --> 04:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I don't see any
 
04:06:12.530 --> 04:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you for your
 
04:06:12.540 --> 04:06:13.729 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you for your
testimony

04:06:13.729 --> 04:06:13.739 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:06:31.729 --> 04:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
committee excuse me for the record my
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
name is Nancy Murphy
 
04:06:35.090 --> 04:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
um I recognize uh representative
 
04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough uh 12 which is the town of
 
04:06:37.500 --> 04:06:39.110 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough uh 12 which is the town of
Merrimack

04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
Merrimack
 
04:06:41.090 --> 04:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I know a lot has been said already so
 
04:06:43.130 --> 04:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'll skip comments about most things but
 
04:06:45.769 --> 04:06:45.779 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to to voice a concern with
 
04:06:48.050 --> 04:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
section two of this
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and I'll with a little different take
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh Public Health agencies and
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
researchers will not be able to assess
 
04:06:57.229 --> 04:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
Geographic patterns of birth outcomes or
 
04:06:59.450 --> 04:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
pregnancy complications because putting
 
04:07:01.610 --> 04:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
up the hospital in place of a home
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
address as suggested and that part of
 
04:07:06.290 --> 04:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
the bill is inaccurate this will be
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
especially problematic for both
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
high-risk pregnancies and deliveries
 
04:07:12.650 --> 04:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
among rural residents but also the
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
problem is specific to my community
 
04:07:18.410 --> 04:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
Public Health agencies or researchers
 
04:07:20.689 --> 04:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
will be unable to assess clusters of
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
birth defects or other health impacts
 
04:07:25.130 --> 04:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
things like birth weight or preeclampsia
 
04:07:27.650 --> 04:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
or on newborns because we will not have
 
04:07:30.650 --> 04:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
town of residence or maternal age age is
 
04:07:32.929 --> 04:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
necessary for all analysis of this kind
 
04:07:34.969 --> 04:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
because newborn health problems are
 
04:07:37.550 --> 04:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
strongly tied to maternal age in
 
04:07:40.250 --> 04:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
Merrimack we have a pfas exposure
 
04:07:43.130 --> 04:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
contamination problem and one of the
 
04:07:45.290 --> 04:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
known Associated Health outcomes is low
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
birth weight in newborns without the
 
04:07:51.650 --> 04:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
ability to assess whether in a hospital
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
we may know that these children are
 
04:07:55.250 --> 04:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
being born with low birth weight but we
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
won't be able to tie them to Merrimack
 
04:07:59.689 --> 04:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
essentially this would give a free pass
 
04:08:02.570 --> 04:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
to a polluter like psychobane and other
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
polluters because the de-identification
 
04:08:07.969 --> 04:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
of birth data will make those analysis
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
impossible so it's just another thought
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
another perspective on how this will
 
04:08:15.889 --> 04:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
potentially impact not only you know a
 
04:08:17.870 --> 04:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
piece situation but other environmental
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
impacts that DHHS may wish to Monitor
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
and they'll be thwarted in that process
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
so that's all thank you thank you for
 
04:08:30.849 --> 04:08:30.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:55.849 --> 04:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair Maguire and
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:09:00.290 --> 04:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
Heidi Caswell and I reside in Bedford
 
04:09:02.090 --> 04:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm here with my son Sam
 
04:09:03.889 --> 04:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
Caswell today
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to testify against Senate
 
04:09:08.809 --> 04:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
Bill 105 in the enormous impact it will
 
04:09:10.610 --> 04:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
have on the timeliness of notifying
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
providers of out of range results for
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
babies born with life-threatening
 
04:09:14.040 --> 04:09:15.130 align:start position:0%
babies born with life-threatening
diseases

04:09:15.130 --> 04:09:15.140 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
04:09:17.689 --> 04:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
diagnosis via newborn screening offers
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
the earliest treatment for a number of
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
diseases some in which a delay of only a
 
04:09:23.809 --> 04:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
few days can be the difference between
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
life and death in many cases later
 
04:09:29.769 --> 04:09:29.779 align:start position:0%
treatment will limit optimal results
 
04:09:32.929 --> 04:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
that could have otherwise slowed or even
 
04:09:35.870 --> 04:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
stopped progression of a deadly disease
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
I had a small pot in advocating for mps1
 
04:09:41.630 --> 04:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
to be added to the newborn screening my
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
son and I both spoke at the newborn
 
04:09:47.210 --> 04:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
screening meeting the night that mps1
 
04:09:50.090 --> 04:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
xald and pompe disease were being voted
 
04:09:51.769 --> 04:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
on to be added and we were thrilled when
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
they were
 
04:09:56.090 --> 04:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
I was and continue to be invested on a
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
very personal level you see my son Sam
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
was born with mps1 hurler syndrome
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the most severe type of mps1 and I had
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
to fight long and hard for a diagnosis
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
I don't want any other parent to have to
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
wait for answers like I did when early
 
04:10:14.210 --> 04:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
diagnosis is right at our fingertips
 
04:10:14.220 --> 04:10:20.210 align:start position:0%
diagnosis is right at our fingertips
today

04:10:20.210 --> 04:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:23.929 --> 04:10:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:27.290 --> 04:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
when Sam was diagnosed
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
there weren't any doctors that seemed to
 
04:10:32.210 --> 04:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
know what MPS was and still there were
 
04:10:34.250 --> 04:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
very few today that do I think they
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
study it for 10 minutes in medical
 
04:10:41.929 --> 04:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
and newborn screening didn't exist for
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
Sam's disease and so many others back
 
04:10:48.290 --> 04:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
when he was born and a lot of hard work
 
04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
has gone into making this a reality by
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
not providing the infant's name I
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
believe the bill will send us into a
 
04:10:57.170 --> 04:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
tailspin backwards
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
after all the progress that's been made
 
04:11:02.090 --> 04:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
to identify serious medical conditions
 
04:11:03.889 --> 04:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
at Birth that were previously so
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to diagnose
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
mps1 like many other diseases on the
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
panel progresses quickly but there are
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
often not physical signs until it is too
 
04:11:14.090 --> 04:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
late for the healthiest outcome both
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
physically and cognitively the Damage
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
that has taken place prior to treatment
 
04:11:21.410 --> 04:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
is irreversible which is why it is
 
04:11:23.330 --> 04:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
imperative the diagnosis be made is
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
shortly after birth as possible
 
04:11:27.530 --> 04:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
newborn screening saves lives by giving
 
04:11:29.090 --> 04:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
babies born with life-threatening
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
conditions early treatment that can slow
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
down or even stop the progression of an
 
04:11:36.290 --> 04:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
otherwise deadly disease
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
parents have hope where there was none
 
04:11:38.160 --> 04:11:39.769 align:start position:0%
parents have hope where there was none
before

04:11:39.769 --> 04:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:11:42.530 --> 04:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
they get to see their children grow up
 
04:11:44.330 --> 04:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm so thankful to have my son Sam
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
sitting next to me today because I very
 
04:11:48.530 --> 04:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
easily could have lost him like so many
 
04:11:50.689 --> 04:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
of my MPS friends have lost their
 
04:11:50.699 --> 04:11:51.590 align:start position:0%
of my MPS friends have lost their
children

04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is that the Department of Vital
 
04:11:55.610 --> 04:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
Records in the Department of Health and
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services can work together to
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
revise the worksheet to accommodate the
 
04:12:03.050 --> 04:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
Privacy Factor while not negatively
 
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
impacting the records in surveillance of
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
newborn screening
 
04:12:09.769 --> 04:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
I'll close by reiterating the statement
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
I believe encompasses the essence of
 
04:12:14.450 --> 04:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
this bill the timeliness of out of range
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
results on the newborn screening panel
 
04:12:19.070 --> 04:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
will be greatly impacted which will
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
interfere with the purpose of the test
 
04:12:24.349 --> 04:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
which was to identify and treat diseases
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that would have progressed or even worse
 
04:12:29.330 --> 04:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
resulted in unnecessary Death newborn
 
04:12:31.969 --> 04:12:31.979 align:start position:0%
screening does save lives as I was ready
 
04:12:33.889 --> 04:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
to leave the house this morning
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
I had a notification and I went on to my
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
Facebook page and it was kind of
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
um surreal that this post came up and
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
this is a friend of mine who lives in
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
Michigan who's lost two children to mps1
 
04:12:50.450 --> 04:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
her post read happy birthday in heaven
 
04:12:52.610 --> 04:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
Matthew today it's hard to believe you
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
were 37 years old on my way to work this
 
04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
morning I wished you a happy birthday
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then I said I know you're with your
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
sister his sister also died of mps1 I
 
04:13:04.130 --> 04:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
only got to spend three birthdays with
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
you but in my heart you were never
 
04:13:08.090 --> 04:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
forgotten love you my dear son until I
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
see you again happy birthday no parent
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
should have to be wishing their children
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
a happy birthday in heaven when they can
 
04:13:17.570 --> 04:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
be diagnosed through newborn screening
 
04:13:19.370 --> 04:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
obviously it didn't exist back then but
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
it does now so I think we really have to
 
04:13:23.090 --> 04:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
take it seriously
 
04:13:25.610 --> 04:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.550 --> 04:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
dear chair Maguire and members of the
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Sam Caswell and I'd
 
04:13:42.769 --> 04:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
like to thank you for letting me share a
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
few words today about why newborn
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
screening is important to me if newborn
 
04:13:50.210 --> 04:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
screening have been available for my
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
disease when I was born I would have
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed within days after birth
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
and my life would be very different
 
04:14:00.170 --> 04:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
I feel extremely lucky and thankful to
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
be here but sadly a number of MPS
 
04:14:05.330 --> 04:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
friends I have met over the years are
 
04:14:08.570 --> 04:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
not when you have mps1 there is a
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
deficiency of a particular enzyme or in
 
04:14:13.969 --> 04:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
most cases you are completely missing
 
04:14:16.849 --> 04:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
the enzyme which is necessary in order
 
04:14:19.130 --> 04:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
for the body to break down and recycle
 
04:14:21.530 --> 04:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
materials and cells
 
04:14:25.610 --> 04:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
without it waste materials store in
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
every organ and tissue causing death
 
04:14:30.889 --> 04:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
without early treatment the reason early
 
04:14:34.490 --> 04:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
diagnosis is so important is because the
 
04:14:36.769 --> 04:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
damage taking place to organs every day
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
can never be reversed
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
treatment will prevent further organ
 
04:14:43.729 --> 04:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
damage but you can never get rid of what
 
04:14:45.769 --> 04:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
is already accumulated
 
04:14:49.250 --> 04:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
now that mps1 is on a newborn screening
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
panel the lack of enzyme activity is
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
flagged and the baby is able to be
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
tested for mps1 and get immediate
 
04:14:57.359 --> 04:14:58.490 align:start position:0%
tested for mps1 and get immediate
treatment

04:14:58.490 --> 04:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
I was so excited when my disease was
 
04:15:03.290 --> 04:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
added to the panel because I figured
 
04:15:05.090 --> 04:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
these babies wouldn't have to go through
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of what I have
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
I didn't get treatment to give me the
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
enzyme for a year which was the case
 
04:15:14.990 --> 04:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
where a lot of my friends with MPS and
 
04:15:16.969 --> 04:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
it damaged to the cells and major organs
 
04:15:19.790 --> 04:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
during that time causes a lifetime of
 
04:15:19.800 --> 04:15:20.750 align:start position:0%
during that time causes a lifetime of
damage

04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
damage
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
my lungs and heart valves have been
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
greatly affected and a number of my
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
friends when MPS have died from these
 
04:15:27.720 --> 04:15:28.610 align:start position:0%
friends when MPS have died from these
issues

04:15:28.610 --> 04:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
I was mainstream for school but the work
 
04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
didn't come to me as easily as it did
 
04:15:36.530 --> 04:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
for my peers and a lot of the kids I
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
know were in life skills programs
 
04:15:41.150 --> 04:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
because of getting treatment later
 
04:15:43.969 --> 04:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
being detected from newborn screening
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
and getting early treatment improves
 
04:15:49.010 --> 04:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
quality of life in every way
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
it slows down the progression of the
 
04:15:53.809 --> 04:15:53.819 align:start position:0%
disease and prevents permanent tissue
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
and organ damage if I had been able to
 
04:15:59.330 --> 04:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
get the enzyme shortly after birth I
 
04:16:01.250 --> 04:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
would be leading a very different and
 
04:16:04.250 --> 04:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
much more independent life than I am
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
I really hope the babies of the future
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
when MPS continue to have opportunities
 
04:16:12.650 --> 04:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
I haven't by being diagnosed for newborn
 
04:16:16.130 --> 04:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
screening thank you for your time
 
04:16:18.050 --> 04:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
Mr Caswell
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
I don't see any
 
04:16:25.070 --> 04:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:29.809 --> 04:16:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to ask the lobbyists then
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
the agencies to support the subcommittee
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
as necessary
 
04:16:33.840 --> 04:16:35.210 align:start position:0%
as necessary
uh

04:16:35.210 --> 04:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is getting a bit
 
04:16:39.950 --> 04:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
a bit repetitive and I think the
 
04:16:41.689 --> 04:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can work out some of the
 
04:16:41.699 --> 04:16:42.769 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can work out some of the
details

04:16:42.769 --> 04:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
details
 
04:16:45.290 --> 04:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
is there any member of the public that
 
04:16:48.889 --> 04:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on Senate Bill 105 and
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in support of Senate
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:58.610 --> 04:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
please we will be delighted to take your
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
written testimony at any time
 
04:17:02.929 --> 04:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
all right in that case I'm going to
 
04:17:05.210 --> 04:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
close this public hearing
 
04:17:08.570 --> 04:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee will this bill will go
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
to representative groda's subcommittee
 
04:17:13.729 --> 04:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
and we will be working on it

to hear how complex people who thought
 
04:17:44.570 --> 04:17:44.580 align:start position:0%

so I'm going to start with the bills
 
05:18:58.970 --> 05:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
that I know have committee reports
 
05:19:00.970 --> 05:19:00.980 align:start position:0%
already written
 
05:19:04.128 --> 05:19:04.138 align:start position:0%
so representative shuitt you have a
 
05:19:14.690 --> 05:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.700 --> 05:19:18.890 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

05:19:18.890 --> 05:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.970 --> 05:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
all right I'll second that if you're
 
05:19:29.160 --> 05:19:30.170 align:start position:0%
all right I'll second that if you're
okay

05:19:30.170 --> 05:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to say there's no one going
 
05:19:36.170 --> 05:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
to second man is that 14
 
05:19:40.010 --> 05:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1493-1493
 
05:19:41.448 --> 05:19:41.458 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:19:44.090 --> 05:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
you can you can talk about that while
 
05:19:46.010 --> 05:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
you're uh while we're all sleeping
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
through our papers to find it yeah
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
everyone should have a copy
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
and passed it out just before we broke
 
05:19:58.390 --> 05:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.400 --> 05:20:00.288 align:start position:0%
 
basically

05:20:00.288 --> 05:20:00.298 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:20:00.298 --> 05:20:01.430 align:start position:0%
basically
um

05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:04.850 --> 05:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
amends the Senate amended version
 
05:20:04.860 --> 05:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
amends the Senate amended version
to

05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
strike out what the senate had
 
05:20:12.730 --> 05:20:12.740 align:start position:0%
originally put in which is addressing
 
05:20:15.410 --> 05:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
you're not we're not you're not
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:22.010 --> 05:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
sorry I moved it back because I was
 
05:20:23.640 --> 05:20:23.650 align:start position:0%
pulling through my papers
 
05:20:23.650 --> 05:20:27.230 align:start position:0%
pulling through my papers
[Laughter]

05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:20:31.010 --> 05:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
um the major difference is
 
05:20:34.430 --> 05:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
under on page two
 
05:20:36.650 --> 05:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
of the build if you're looking at the
 
05:20:36.660 --> 05:20:37.490 align:start position:0%
of the build if you're looking at the
bill

05:20:37.490 --> 05:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:20:39.890 --> 05:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
under age
 
05:20:39.900 --> 05:20:41.810 align:start position:0%
under age
and

05:20:41.810 --> 05:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:44.050 --> 05:20:44.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I am looking at the amendment
 
05:20:47.230 --> 05:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment on page two
 
05:20:50.810 --> 05:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
line 20 through 22.
 
05:20:53.930 --> 05:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
we struck the Senate Amendment
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
originally took that entire exemption
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
out but we reinstated it to say that the
 
05:21:03.288 --> 05:21:03.298 align:start position:0%
board can exempt the dentist one
 
05:21:05.090 --> 05:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
specific dentist
 
05:21:08.090 --> 05:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
from the above requirement if they are
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
board eligible or were certified in
 
05:21:15.050 --> 05:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
either Dental anesthesiology or oral and
 
05:21:18.550 --> 05:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
maxillofacial surgery we heard
 
05:21:21.410 --> 05:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee and subsequently
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
that this was something that the board
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
was seeking to do
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the amendment is
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
basically just
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
allowing the board to Institute rules
 
05:21:38.050 --> 05:21:38.060 align:start position:0%
to facilitate
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
the changes that were brought in the
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
Senate amended version of the bill
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes and the
 
05:21:50.350 --> 05:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
the audit of the Dental Board identified
 
05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
that a they should have a a subcommittee
 
05:21:58.330 --> 05:21:58.340 align:start position:0%
on anesthesiology
 
05:22:01.010 --> 05:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists to
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
provide technical expertise and so
 
05:22:06.050 --> 05:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill does
 
05:22:09.170 --> 05:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
in the amendment and they also took
 
05:22:12.288 --> 05:22:12.298 align:start position:0%
umbrage with the idea that all board
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
certified dentists would be exempt from
 
05:22:16.368 --> 05:22:16.378 align:start position:0%
the requirement of having a second
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
person there
 
05:22:21.788 --> 05:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
so this only allows them to exempt
 
05:22:24.250 --> 05:22:24.260 align:start position:0%
specific people or specific
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances and
 
05:22:30.350 --> 05:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with with allowing the board to
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do that and
 
05:22:34.368 --> 05:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
they're already working on rules that
 
05:22:35.948 --> 05:22:35.958 align:start position:0%
would implement it
 
05:22:39.650 --> 05:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
and the other important part in the bill
 
05:22:43.010 --> 05:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
that came from the Senate was to permit
 
05:22:45.890 --> 05:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
Dental facilities because that had not
 
05:22:48.170 --> 05:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
been addressed previously in the
 
05:22:48.180 --> 05:22:49.850 align:start position:0%
been addressed previously in the
statutes

05:22:49.850 --> 05:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
05:22:53.330 --> 05:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
and it came up at caucus and I'd like to
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
reiterate that it's very different from
 
05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
the facility licensing for massage
 
05:23:02.590 --> 05:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
parlors because the Dental Board already
 
05:23:06.890 --> 05:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
inspects dental offices and facilities
 
05:23:11.690 --> 05:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
for suitability for for anesthesia
 
05:23:14.448 --> 05:23:14.458 align:start position:0%
what this does is it allows them to give
 
05:23:15.890 --> 05:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
the license
 
05:23:18.890 --> 05:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
for the facility at one time and they
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to repeat the application and
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
the inspection
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
every time Personnel changes so it's
 
05:23:29.448 --> 05:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
it's simpler
 
05:23:31.250 --> 05:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments or
 
05:23:31.260 --> 05:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments or
questions

05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.840 --> 05:23:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:23:38.270 --> 05:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
not seeing any the motion is to adopt
 
05:23:40.970 --> 05:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1493.
 
05:23:43.128 --> 05:23:43.138 align:start position:0%

05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
um do you wish to discuss I don't think
 
05:24:42.288 --> 05:24:42.298 align:start position:0%
there's too much more to be said about
 
05:24:44.810 --> 05:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
the bill we've pretty much discussed the
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%

05:25:52.430 --> 05:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
another another demerit
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
do you what did you vote
 
05:25:54.360 --> 05:25:55.690 align:start position:0%
do you what did you vote
okay

05:25:55.690 --> 05:25:55.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:59.330 --> 05:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
it's 19 to zero all right and the motion
 
05:26:02.090 --> 05:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
passes 19 to zero is there any objection
 
05:26:04.250 --> 05:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
to consent
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we'll put that one
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
on consent
 
05:26:14.448 --> 05:26:14.458 align:start position:0%
okay and the next one is
 
05:26:14.458 --> 05:26:17.530 align:start position:0%
okay and the next one is
uh

05:26:17.530 --> 05:26:17.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:21.170 --> 05:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 203 yes
 
05:26:21.180 --> 05:26:27.050 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 203 yes
uh

05:26:27.050 --> 05:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative shua do you want to move
 
05:26:30.830 --> 05:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
the commotion
 
05:26:35.390 --> 05:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:36.830 --> 05:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
did you have an amendment what's the
 
05:26:36.840 --> 05:26:39.410 align:start position:0%
did you have an amendment what's the
number

05:26:39.410 --> 05:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so I believe we are looking at
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
so you're moving the amendment and this
 
05:26:50.760 --> 05:26:51.708 align:start position:0%
so you're moving the amendment and this
was

05:26:51.708 --> 05:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:26:54.830 --> 05:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
um adopted by the subcommittee in a
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:02.770 --> 05:27:02.780 align:start position:0%
and basically it um
 
05:27:06.650 --> 05:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
it negates the rest of the bill
 
05:27:09.850 --> 05:27:09.860 align:start position:0%
because the inclination
 
05:27:13.250 --> 05:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
one we heard from the Commerce Committee
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
which normally would hear this
 
05:27:17.230 --> 05:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
representative do we have that Amendment
 
05:27:19.368 --> 05:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
pardon me do we have that amendment I
 
05:27:20.708 --> 05:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
can't find it
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think I believe that she submitted
 
05:27:26.448 --> 05:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
this it was days ago yeah at the last
 
05:27:28.910 --> 05:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
the last time we got together yeah which
 
05:27:30.530 --> 05:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can so it's somewhere in
 
05:27:32.270 --> 05:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
your files
 
05:27:34.550 --> 05:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
and somewhere in my files which I can't
 
05:27:38.110 --> 05:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:40.730 --> 05:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
I can almost read it to you it's only
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
like two sentences why don't you do that
 
05:27:47.690 --> 05:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
while we're all shuffling papers here
 
05:27:52.490 --> 05:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm in the bill by replacing all
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
after the enacting Clause with the
 
05:27:59.570 --> 05:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
following office of professional life
 
05:28:01.490 --> 05:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
insurance certification board of
 
05:28:04.850 --> 05:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing website if the
 
05:28:07.850 --> 05:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
board excuse me if the board of
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing under RSA 205 a
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
colon 25 through colon 31 is repealed
 
05:28:18.050 --> 05:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
then the office of professional
 
05:28:20.448 --> 05:28:20.458 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification shall
 
05:28:22.490 --> 05:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
maintain the board of manufactured
 
05:28:26.510 --> 05:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
housing website for the board for a
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
minimum of five years from the effective
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
date of this act which is 60 days after
 
05:28:32.160 --> 05:28:33.590 align:start position:0%
date of this act which is 60 days after
Passage

05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's because the board is actually
 
05:28:41.570 --> 05:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
abolished in-house Bill 2
 
05:28:44.090 --> 05:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
and if that goes through
 
05:28:46.670 --> 05:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
we are
 
05:28:48.970 --> 05:28:48.980 align:start position:0%
what's the word I want to use expecting
 
05:28:51.770 --> 05:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
that there's likely going to be some
 
05:28:55.128 --> 05:28:55.138 align:start position:0%
sort of reiteration of a board to deal
 
05:28:57.650 --> 05:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
with the issues that as we heard are
 
05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
very prevalent
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
and this would allow
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
that word to be referenced through the
 
05:29:07.250 --> 05:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
ovalc website at some point
 
05:29:09.770 --> 05:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
if it happens in five years if it
 
05:29:11.930 --> 05:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen that soon then they
 
05:29:14.628 --> 05:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
probably don't need one yeah the
 
05:29:16.850 --> 05:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
testimony at the hearing convinced me
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
that we did not want to
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
maintain the board and change it in the
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
way the bill wanted
 
05:29:24.120 --> 05:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
way the bill wanted
but

05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:29:28.610 --> 05:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
it does it does serve a useful purpose
 
05:29:30.890 --> 05:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
we aren't really the right people to
 
05:29:33.910 --> 05:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get a
 
05:29:37.010 --> 05:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
quasi-judicial complaint board set up
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
but we can at least save the history and
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
the records so that whenever such such
 
05:29:45.708 --> 05:29:45.718 align:start position:0%
any an organ
 
05:29:48.470 --> 05:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
whatever method is chosen to deal with
 
05:29:51.288 --> 05:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
the issue they won't lose the history I
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
thought that would be important and the
 
05:29:57.530 --> 05:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
oplc says it doesn't cost anything so
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.310 --> 05:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
I need for representative true
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
and but
 
05:30:08.090 --> 05:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm still shuffling
 
05:30:08.100 --> 05:30:09.830 align:start position:0%
um I'm still shuffling
so

05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
the website that is maintained is the
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
oplc it for some reason because its
 
05:30:19.128 --> 05:30:19.138 align:start position:0%
title is board the and nobody else
 
05:30:22.010 --> 05:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
wanted it the manufactured housing board
 
05:30:24.650 --> 05:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
which is a quasi-nuditional board to
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
resolve issues in manufactured housing
 
05:30:27.360 --> 05:30:28.670 align:start position:0%
resolve issues in manufactured housing
parks

05:30:28.670 --> 05:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
parks
 
05:30:31.970 --> 05:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
is housed within the oplc
 
05:30:34.610 --> 05:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
and their website is on the oplc website
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's a link to it
 
05:30:42.010 --> 05:30:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:52.250 --> 05:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
do we have any
 
05:30:54.350 --> 05:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
idea what the Senate's going to do in
 
05:30:54.360 --> 05:30:55.550 align:start position:0%
idea what the Senate's going to do in
response

05:30:55.550 --> 05:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
response
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
I mean we may not care but
 
05:31:00.288 --> 05:31:00.298 align:start position:0%
uh the thing of it is that the house
 
05:31:04.030 --> 05:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
position is that board goes away
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
so it's in hb2 all right good enough so
 
05:31:10.368 --> 05:31:10.378 align:start position:0%
if it's going away
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want to reinstate it
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
and reformulate it
 
05:31:18.170 --> 05:31:18.180 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what the Senate is
 
05:31:20.090 --> 05:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
going to do because it's in house two
 
05:31:23.150 --> 05:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
which they haven't yet produced
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:26.638 --> 05:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:31:27.590 --> 05:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:31:27.600 --> 05:31:28.910 align:start position:0%
it
awesome

05:31:28.910 --> 05:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
awesome
 
05:31:30.650 --> 05:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
it keeps the history
 
05:31:33.708 --> 05:31:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:36.170 --> 05:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any the motion is to
 
05:31:39.170 --> 05:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 1365 that the clerk and
 
05:31:40.670 --> 05:31:40.680 align:start position:0%

I move ought to pass with Amendment for
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
seconds all over
 
05:32:36.050 --> 05:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
I think Gould was first yes

comment I'll say the same and certainly

the ROC community members are I think
 
05:32:52.490 --> 05:32:52.500 align:start position:0%

05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
particular board on them
 
05:33:13.250 --> 05:33:13.260 align:start position:0%

seeing none will put that one on consent
 
05:34:04.260 --> 05:34:05.930 align:start position:0%
seeing none will put that one on consent
also

05:34:05.930 --> 05:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%

05:34:12.890 --> 05:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
pre-written committee report that we can
 
05:34:15.410 --> 05:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:17.930 --> 05:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none will go on to more of the
 
05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
easy ones
 
05:34:22.550 --> 05:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 108 which we heard this
 
05:34:22.560 --> 05:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 108 which we heard this
morning

05:34:23.750 --> 05:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
does anyone have emotion we said we'd
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:34.430 --> 05:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
all right representative Gould moves
 
05:34:35.690 --> 05:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and second by
 
05:34:40.010 --> 05:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Simon Patrick oh excuse
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
me for Patrick I could tell which
 
05:34:49.070 --> 05:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:51.708 --> 05:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gould do you wish to
 
05:34:54.110 --> 05:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion
 
05:34:56.510 --> 05:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
well obviously I was very moved by the
 
05:34:58.550 --> 05:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning because of their
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
work with Juvenile Justice Defenders but
 
05:35:03.288 --> 05:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
seriously I think that this is an
 
05:35:05.930 --> 05:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
important means to help them retain and
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
recruit good quality public defenders
 
05:35:10.610 --> 05:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
the service they provide to our state 80
 
05:35:13.610 --> 05:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
percent I was shocked at that number of
 
05:35:13.620 --> 05:35:14.208 align:start position:0%
percent I was shocked at that number of
um

05:35:14.208 --> 05:35:14.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:16.368 --> 05:35:16.378 align:start position:0%
of the cases in New Hampshire they
 
05:35:18.170 --> 05:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
represent and
 
05:35:20.090 --> 05:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and they just do a fantastic job and
 
05:35:22.670 --> 05:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm very supportive of this all right
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick
 
05:35:27.230 --> 05:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Goods summed it up just
 
05:35:29.990 --> 05:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
fine thank you thank you representative
 
05:35:32.270 --> 05:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
just briefly I mean I express concerns
 
05:35:34.910 --> 05:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
about the cost but that was based on a
 
05:35:38.208 --> 05:35:38.218 align:start position:0%
a incorrect assumption that
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
they weren't getting subsidized health
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
care now and this would be adding it
 
05:35:43.628 --> 05:35:43.638 align:start position:0%
which could be a significant expense but
 
05:35:45.948 --> 05:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
apparently they're getting it now this
 
05:35:48.530 --> 05:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
will just be a different program and it
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
will be minor changes so I'm okay with
 
05:35:57.050 --> 05:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:59.510 --> 05:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes they give us some some data to show
 
05:36:02.448 --> 05:36:02.458 align:start position:0%
the insurance convince us that the it
 
05:36:07.250 --> 05:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:11.930 --> 05:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
because the motion is ought to pass on
 
05:36:16.490 --> 05:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 108 and the clerk can call
 
05:36:18.890 --> 05:36:18.900 align:start position:0%

on Senate bill 49.
 
05:38:39.970 --> 05:38:39.980 align:start position:0%
your amendment is
 
05:38:43.310 --> 05:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
1476h that I handed out just prior to
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:48.890 --> 05:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
and I know everybody has a stack of
 
05:38:50.990 --> 05:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
papers in front of them so
 
05:38:56.230 --> 05:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
1476. all right you wish to speak to
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:05.690 --> 05:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
was brought forward
 
05:39:08.930 --> 05:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
um because I feel and I think listening
 
05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
to the majority of the folks here on the
 
05:39:13.788 --> 05:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
Edna committee feel that
 
05:39:13.798 --> 05:39:14.690 align:start position:0%
Edna committee feel that
um

05:39:14.690 --> 05:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:16.430 --> 05:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate that
 
05:39:20.090 --> 05:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
oplc have a dedicated lapsing fund
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund
 
05:39:24.110 --> 05:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
um of up to three million dollars but
 
05:39:26.330 --> 05:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
once it gets to that 3 million the bill
 
05:39:27.890 --> 05:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
is I came over
 
05:39:30.770 --> 05:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
sent any surplus over 3 million back to
 
05:39:33.410 --> 05:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
the general fund I think it's important
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
that that money be used to reduce
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
licensing fees and certification instead
 
05:39:40.010 --> 05:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
of just filling the coffers of the
 
05:39:42.288 --> 05:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
general fund um this is what that is
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
intended for and this is what that this
 
05:39:45.770 --> 05:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
amendment does is keeps that money
 
05:39:48.050 --> 05:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
towards fee reductions
 
05:39:49.550 --> 05:39:49.560 align:start position:0%

05:40:14.090 --> 05:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
my objections I I thought we were over
 
05:40:14.100 --> 05:40:15.590 align:start position:0%
my objections I I thought we were over
taxing

05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
taxing
 
05:40:17.570 --> 05:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh for money just to go into the general
 
05:40:17.580 --> 05:40:19.368 align:start position:0%
uh for money just to go into the general
fund

05:40:19.368 --> 05:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:40:22.850 --> 05:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
um and that would have been a no for me
 
05:40:22.860 --> 05:40:25.788 align:start position:0%
um and that would have been a no for me
um

05:40:25.788 --> 05:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
limiting it to 3 million I know the uh
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
they had a problem with uh money running
 
05:40:34.550 --> 05:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
out all the all the money going back to
 
05:40:35.930 --> 05:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
the general fund and I'm not having any
 
05:40:37.368 --> 05:40:37.378 align:start position:0%
money to run
 
05:40:39.170 --> 05:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
let me get it to three million seems
 
05:40:42.610 --> 05:40:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.230 --> 05:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
05:40:47.690 --> 05:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
chair yeah um I'm in support of this I
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a mention of uh I'm
 
05:40:53.930 --> 05:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
assuming that the oplc will be in charge
 
05:40:56.990 --> 05:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
of redistributing Licensing fees and
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
certification fees under this uh my only
 
05:41:01.550 --> 05:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
concern and just for the record and for
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
the record only
 
05:41:03.120 --> 05:41:04.070 align:start position:0%
the record only
um

05:41:04.070 --> 05:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:07.368 --> 05:41:07.378 align:start position:0%
is just redistribution of one board's
 
05:41:09.288 --> 05:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
fees to other boards I like it way
 
05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
better than sending it to the general
 
05:41:13.910 --> 05:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
fund but I'd love to know how oplc is
 
05:41:17.050 --> 05:41:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:19.730 --> 05:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
we are all interested
 
05:41:19.740 --> 05:41:21.050 align:start position:0%
we are all interested
and

05:41:21.050 --> 05:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:24.830 --> 05:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
I think if you look down to line 15 that
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
certification show report biannually
 
05:41:29.810 --> 05:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
each July on how the funds were expended
 
05:41:32.270 --> 05:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
over the previous biennium so hopefully
 
05:41:34.010 --> 05:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
in that reporting we will find out where
 
05:41:36.350 --> 05:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
the money is going they are also
 
05:41:41.570 --> 05:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
required by it by other statute that the
 
05:41:41.580 --> 05:41:42.948 align:start position:0%
required by it by other statute that the
um

05:41:42.948 --> 05:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:46.250 --> 05:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
they report annually to that same list
 
05:41:47.890 --> 05:41:47.900 align:start position:0%
of people
 
05:41:51.288 --> 05:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
on all of their boards what they've done
 
05:41:53.448 --> 05:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
and it includes things like how many
 
05:41:55.970 --> 05:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
people are licensed under each board how
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
many complaints and what the fees are
 
05:42:00.410 --> 05:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
and you and it's very easy to look at
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
that and say this Board needs to
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
is paying too much and this board is
 
05:42:10.430 --> 05:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
probably paying isn't paying enough so I
 
05:42:12.770 --> 05:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
think that's uh
 
05:42:15.288 --> 05:42:15.298 align:start position:0%
we should be able to adjust how they're
 
05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
other expending it representative Simon
 
05:42:21.530 --> 05:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
yeah my only other thought too is maybe
 
05:42:23.750 --> 05:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can communicate with oplc although I
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
know they know this is a concern as well
 
05:42:28.310 --> 05:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
um keeping those fees consistent from
 
05:42:31.730 --> 05:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
year to year so that the licensees know
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
when there's a drop because of excess
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
funds and to expect it to go back up the
 
05:42:38.330 --> 05:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
next year
 
05:42:40.250 --> 05:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you know so that they have an
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
anticipation of what what what's coming
 
05:42:45.110 --> 05:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
down the pike yes
 
05:42:47.090 --> 05:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's going to be interesting to
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
see how they adjust just the fees
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:42:53.270 --> 05:42:53.280 align:start position:0%

all right Senate Bill 71 representative
 
05:45:47.208 --> 05:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
Simon you've got a an amendment yes
 
05:45:58.670 --> 05:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:01.190 --> 05:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion um sure so
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
um the bill as it came to us had two
 
05:46:05.690 --> 05:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
parts to it the first um expanded the
 
05:46:07.610 --> 05:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
presumption that cancer disease in a
 
05:46:10.730 --> 05:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
firefighter was occupationally
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
um had occurred occupationally
 
05:46:13.920 --> 05:46:14.570 align:start position:0%
um had occurred occupationally
um

05:46:14.570 --> 05:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:18.410 --> 05:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
and so for the purposes of
 
05:46:21.170 --> 05:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
workers compensation uh would be
 
05:46:24.170 --> 05:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
presumed that that cancer was caused uh
 
05:46:27.048 --> 05:46:27.058 align:start position:0%
while on the job and the second part uh
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
formed a commission uh to study a
 
05:46:32.090 --> 05:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
screening for firefighters
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
um this amendment keeps the first part
 
05:46:37.128 --> 05:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
of the bill intact and Strikes the
 
05:46:39.170 --> 05:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
commission the members of the
 
05:46:39.180 --> 05:46:40.610 align:start position:0%
commission the members of the
subcommittee

05:46:40.610 --> 05:46:40.620 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
05:46:44.090 --> 05:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
um were agreed that the commission was
 
05:46:46.610 --> 05:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
likely to be ineffective in reaching the
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
goals uh that it wanted to achieve and
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
so we took that out
 
05:46:51.120 --> 05:46:52.910 align:start position:0%
so we took that out
okay

05:46:52.910 --> 05:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
you have something
 
05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
who did second that true represent true
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:03.470 --> 05:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes just uh to to clarify a little bit
 
05:47:06.170 --> 05:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
that what we did in the subcommittee
 
05:47:06.180 --> 05:47:08.090 align:start position:0%
that what we did in the subcommittee
um

05:47:08.090 --> 05:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:11.448 --> 05:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
this this this makes it a presumption
 
05:47:15.410 --> 05:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
that and that cancer uh on a within a
 
05:47:15.420 --> 05:47:16.970 align:start position:0%
that and that cancer uh on a within a
firefighter

05:47:16.970 --> 05:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
firefighter
 
05:47:19.670 --> 05:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
um is uh workman's compensated workman's
 
05:47:23.390 --> 05:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
comp I would be a workman's comp case
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
that that presumption as it was
 
05:47:25.440 --> 05:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
that that presumption as it was
explained

05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
explained
 
05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
does not mean a guaranteed coverage
 
05:47:33.410 --> 05:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
they gave an example of a case that was
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
undercover that was being covered as the
 
05:47:37.970 --> 05:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
bill as the law is now
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it went before workman's
 
05:47:42.288 --> 05:47:42.298 align:start position:0%
compensation they argued the point and
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
the uh the case was denied even though
 
05:47:46.910 --> 05:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
that particular cancer was one that came
 
05:47:49.070 --> 05:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
under the presumption
 
05:47:52.368 --> 05:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
um so knowing that the presumption is
 
05:47:55.670 --> 05:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
not an automatic guarantee of workman's
 
05:47:57.530 --> 05:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
compensation it still has to be proven
 
05:48:00.350 --> 05:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
Beyond a reasonable sense of Doubt
 
05:48:02.208 --> 05:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
um I I came to the conclusion that this
 
05:48:04.368 --> 05:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
is this amendment should pass
 
05:48:04.378 --> 05:48:05.708 align:start position:0%
is this amendment should pass
okay

05:48:05.708 --> 05:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative leckis and then shewitt
 
05:48:10.250 --> 05:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh just uh glad to see that the
 
05:48:12.590 --> 05:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
amendment fixes the problem of a
 
05:48:15.230 --> 05:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
committee which is formed its report is
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.690 --> 05:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
do you have a question yes I thought we
 
05:48:36.048 --> 05:48:36.058 align:start position:0%
had talked about eliminating the Cancer
 
05:48:39.288 --> 05:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
Society from the membership oh yes well
 
05:48:41.448 --> 05:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
let's if we're deleting the commission
 
05:48:44.810 --> 05:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
it doesn't uh matter okay this is
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
deleting okay all right all right the
 
05:48:52.128 --> 05:48:52.138 align:start position:0%
if I may the point is that this
 
05:48:55.448 --> 05:48:55.458 align:start position:0%
information is needed but
 
05:48:59.208 --> 05:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
in a short period of time that
 
05:49:01.190 --> 05:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
that study commission was just
 
05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
infeasible right so we hope that uh very
 
05:49:08.208 --> 05:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
the insurance company or workers comp or
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
the employers of firemen
 
05:49:14.090 --> 05:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
will do some studies
 
05:49:14.100 --> 05:49:15.230 align:start position:0%
will do some studies
okay

05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:17.330 --> 05:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
we think we just don't think that one is
 
05:49:19.368 --> 05:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
05:49:19.378 --> 05:49:20.810 align:start position:0%
going to work
okay

05:49:20.810 --> 05:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:26.160 --> 05:49:28.930 align:start position:0%
 
sure

05:49:28.930 --> 05:49:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
but but fun
 
05:49:31.320 --> 05:49:32.090 align:start position:0%
but but fun
um

05:49:32.090 --> 05:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
another problem with the bill as it was
 
05:49:34.558 --> 05:49:35.628 align:start position:0%
another problem with the bill as it was
written

05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:49:39.948 --> 05:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
is that in any committee or Commission
 
05:49:44.208 --> 05:49:44.218 align:start position:0%
the legislature must form a majority of
 
05:49:45.890 --> 05:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:49:48.650 --> 05:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
and and the bill as it was written we
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
were the minority
 
05:49:52.610 --> 05:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
and that is is for future reference
 
05:49:54.470 --> 05:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
we'll probably never hear of a committee
 
05:49:56.510 --> 05:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
or a commission again in this
 
05:49:59.330 --> 05:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
in this committee but uh
 
05:50:01.850 --> 05:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
the how the legislature must form the
 
05:50:04.010 --> 05:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
majority of a committee
 
05:50:04.020 --> 05:50:05.150 align:start position:0%
majority of a committee
okay

05:50:05.150 --> 05:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
and at a technical study like that I
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't think there'd be very many
 
05:50:12.890 --> 05:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
legislators who would usefully
 
05:50:17.208 --> 05:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
all right can anyone else have a quick
 
05:50:20.448 --> 05:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
comment question
 
05:50:23.288 --> 05:50:23.298 align:start position:0%

um Amendment 1453
 
05:52:38.510 --> 05:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
second by representative true

okay
okay

05:52:45.708 --> 05:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:48.770 --> 05:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
yes this one is
 
05:52:48.780 --> 05:52:50.510 align:start position:0%
yes this one is
okay

05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so this amendment
 
05:52:54.110 --> 05:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
um was brought to the subcommittee this
 
05:52:54.120 --> 05:52:55.310 align:start position:0%
um was brought to the subcommittee this
morning

05:52:55.310 --> 05:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:52:58.670 --> 05:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:58.680 --> 05:53:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:53:00.470 --> 05:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:53:02.690 --> 05:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
amendment is very similar to the bill
 
05:53:05.570 --> 05:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
except for on the back
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
um well it's on the back of this bill
 
05:53:11.448 --> 05:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
but it removes the criminal justice
 
05:53:11.458 --> 05:53:12.110 align:start position:0%
but it removes the criminal justice
um

05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:15.230 --> 05:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
degree from the
 
05:53:15.240 --> 05:53:15.948 align:start position:0%
degree from the
um

05:53:15.948 --> 05:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:18.610 --> 05:53:18.620 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:53:22.128 --> 05:53:22.138 align:start position:0%
requirements and um
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
because originally it had been put into
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
this bill it's not in current statute
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
and had been put in because
 
05:53:32.990 --> 05:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
um one of the local colleges was going
 
05:53:34.910 --> 05:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
to offer a course that was going to be
 
05:53:38.030 --> 05:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable by the board but they have
 
05:53:41.810 --> 05:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
withdrawn that the course and if there
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
it evolved it involved criminal justice
 
05:53:45.770 --> 05:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
so any kind of um
 
05:53:48.890 --> 05:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
we did clear with the director of oplc
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
that should there be a
 
05:53:55.010 --> 05:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
um a college course
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
or college program that allows criminal
 
05:54:00.470 --> 05:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
justice to have these kinds of courses
 
05:54:02.208 --> 05:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
that are required for this kind of
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
practice it can be added during
 
05:54:04.320 --> 05:54:06.350 align:start position:0%
practice it can be added during
rulemaking

05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
05:54:09.048 --> 05:54:09.058 align:start position:0%
so this what this what this amendment
 
05:54:10.910 --> 05:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
does essentially does the same thing as
 
05:54:13.690 --> 05:54:13.700 align:start position:0%
the original bill was to allow
 
05:54:16.490 --> 05:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
individuals who are being treated and
 
05:54:20.048 --> 05:54:20.058 align:start position:0%
followed by members of the laidac board
 
05:54:23.330 --> 05:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
05:54:26.390 --> 05:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
um be treated by those specialists
 
05:54:30.288 --> 05:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
even though their substance abuse might
 
05:54:30.298 --> 05:54:31.670 align:start position:0%
even though their substance abuse might
be

05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:54:31.680 --> 05:54:33.530 align:start position:0%
be
um

05:54:33.530 --> 05:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
control controlled yes let's use that
 
05:54:36.240 --> 05:54:38.628 align:start position:0%
control controlled yes let's use that
word

05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:41.570 --> 05:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
because typically if someone who sees
 
05:54:45.048 --> 05:54:45.058 align:start position:0%
the laidac specialist has their cons
 
05:54:47.570 --> 05:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
their substance abuse control under
 
05:54:49.250 --> 05:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
control their substitutes under control
 
05:54:51.650 --> 05:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
they are then required to go seek
 
05:54:53.930 --> 05:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
counseling from another
 
05:54:56.448 --> 05:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
a type of best specialist so therefore
 
05:54:59.628 --> 05:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
this allows continuity of care
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:55:10.850 --> 05:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yeah um there's
 
05:55:12.470 --> 05:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
people might notice there's some change
 
05:55:14.270 --> 05:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
in the wording for the education
 
05:55:16.430 --> 05:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
requirements but uh
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
it has no real change just changes the
 
05:55:21.410 --> 05:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
language that's used the requirements
 
05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:29.270 --> 05:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank what what it also does
 
05:55:31.788 --> 05:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
is that it increases the number of
 
05:55:34.730 --> 05:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals of the state
 
05:55:37.970 --> 05:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
simply by allowing them Master's level
 
05:55:39.590 --> 05:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
to latex
 
05:55:41.110 --> 05:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
to treat
 
05:55:43.548 --> 05:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
non-coccurring disorders so I think
 
05:55:47.110 --> 05:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:50.330 --> 05:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
yes I'll just note also that we heard
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
during testimony that in many cases it
 
05:55:57.890 --> 05:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
was very important for the client to
 
05:56:00.590 --> 05:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
continue a relationship that they had
 
05:56:03.470 --> 05:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
developed with a counselor so I think
 
05:56:07.010 --> 05:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's an important facet
 
05:56:07.020 --> 05:56:09.110 align:start position:0%
that's an important facet
okay

05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:56:12.590 --> 05:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.490 --> 05:56:15.500 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is to adopt Amendment
 
05:56:19.548 --> 05:56:19.558 align:start position:0%
1453 to Senate Bill 44 and the clerk and
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
call the rule
 
05:56:23.690 --> 05:56:23.700 align:start position:0%

Fitzpatrick yes representative Gould yes
 
05:56:56.208 --> 05:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes and the chair
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes it adoption the amendment is adopted
 
05:57:02.030 --> 05:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
19 to zero
 
05:57:02.040 --> 05:57:04.788 align:start position:0%
19 to zero
okay

05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative leckis do you have a
 
05:57:06.840 --> 05:57:08.448 align:start position:0%
uh representative leckis do you have a
motion

05:57:08.448 --> 05:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:57:08.458 --> 05:57:09.650 align:start position:0%
motion
yes

05:57:09.650 --> 05:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:57:12.890 --> 05:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
otpa on Senate Bill 44 with with the
 
05:57:12.900 --> 05:57:14.750 align:start position:0%
otpa on Senate Bill 44 with with the
amendment

05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:57:19.310 --> 05:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:22.910 --> 05:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
I think we covered most of it it
 
05:57:26.810 --> 05:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
increases the scope of practice for the
 
05:57:29.390 --> 05:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
mldacs it allows as was mentioned
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
continuity of care I mean it's hard
 
05:57:33.770 --> 05:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
enough for somebody to find a mental
 
05:57:35.868 --> 05:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
health counselor that they work well
 
05:57:38.150 --> 05:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
with to have to have them you know once
 
05:57:39.650 --> 05:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
they've dealt with one problem now they
 
05:57:41.628 --> 05:57:41.638 align:start position:0%
have to go find somebody else's
 
05:57:43.610 --> 05:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
I think not reasonable
 
05:57:47.390 --> 05:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
um that's basically what it does
 
05:57:49.670 --> 05:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
05:57:53.448 --> 05:57:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:55.490 --> 05:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion is ought to pass
 
05:57:59.810 --> 05:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
you're correct representative Schmidt I
 
05:58:07.128 --> 05:58:07.138 align:start position:0%
forgot with Amendment on Senate bill 44.
 
05:58:09.530 --> 05:58:09.540 align:start position:0%

chair I'd like to move
 
05:59:17.900 --> 05:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to move
Amendment

05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:24.240 --> 05:59:25.368 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:59:25.368 --> 05:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:59:27.770 --> 05:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll second second by
 
05:59:31.310 --> 05:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:35.570 --> 05:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
in this um there were two changes made
 
05:59:38.448 --> 05:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
to the bill number one it references a
 
05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
different RSA
 
05:59:43.610 --> 05:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
um the original RSA that was referenced
 
05:59:45.048 --> 05:59:45.058 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
05:59:50.590 --> 05:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
um was referring to the nursing board
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
and this is actually a nursing agency
 
05:59:57.170 --> 05:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
registration it is nothing to do it is
 
05:59:58.970 --> 05:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
not related to the nursing board and
 
05:59:58.980 --> 06:00:00.230 align:start position:0%
not related to the nursing board and
therefore

06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
06:00:02.390 --> 06:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're giving it its own individual
 
06:00:05.868 --> 06:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
chapter in RSA which is 326m as
 
06:00:08.150 --> 06:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
recommended by oplc
 
06:00:11.990 --> 06:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
the other change is
 
06:00:15.288 --> 06:00:15.298 align:start position:0%
in the back
 
06:00:21.048 --> 06:00:21.058 align:start position:0%
yes in a sec on on page two line six
 
06:00:24.048 --> 06:00:24.058 align:start position:0%
uh on until line eight
 
06:00:24.058 --> 06:00:25.490 align:start position:0%
uh on until line eight
um

06:00:25.490 --> 06:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:27.890 --> 06:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
this sentence ended with four such
 
06:00:30.410 --> 06:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
reason which didn't really have anything
 
06:00:33.530 --> 06:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
there were no reasons given in that
 
06:00:36.288 --> 06:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
section so that was eliminated so the
 
06:00:39.470 --> 06:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
sentence reads nurse agency shall not
 
06:00:41.330 --> 06:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
commit Services of a single nurse or
 
06:00:43.490 --> 06:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant to more than
 
06:00:45.048 --> 06:00:45.058 align:start position:0%
one Health Care Facility for the same
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
time period or a shift and cancel
 
06:00:49.910 --> 06:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
commitment to a facility or compel that
 
06:00:51.890 --> 06:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
facility to bid again for services
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
already promised it period
 
06:00:57.650 --> 06:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
those are the changes that were made to
 
06:00:57.660 --> 06:00:58.628 align:start position:0%
those are the changes that were made to
the

06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill okay president oblakis thank you
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
um all say is uh you know even if people
 
06:01:06.770 --> 06:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the underlying bill
 
06:01:08.390 --> 06:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
I suggest supporting the amendment
 
06:01:10.730 --> 06:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
because if it were to pass
 
06:01:13.448 --> 06:01:13.458 align:start position:0%
without this it would get stuck under
 
06:01:16.368 --> 06:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
the nursing board statute and that would
 
06:01:17.448 --> 06:01:17.458 align:start position:0%
make no sense
 
06:01:23.930 --> 06:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.448 --> 06:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
thank you um was there any talk in the
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm just curious
 
06:01:28.080 --> 06:01:28.730 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm just curious
um

06:01:28.730 --> 06:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:31.310 --> 06:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this section 6
 
06:01:36.048 --> 06:01:36.058 align:start position:0%
through 8 on page two will delay nursing
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
is that on the amendment yeah on the
 
06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it's also on the original bill
 
06:01:49.610 --> 06:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
right now I was just curious if
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
if they're not not allowed to basically
 
06:01:54.590 --> 06:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
make somebody bid for a contract that
 
06:01:55.730 --> 06:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
they already have because they're doing
 
06:01:58.670 --> 06:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
that last moment presently if they'll
 
06:02:01.788 --> 06:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
delay committing to one group
 
06:02:01.798 --> 06:02:03.410 align:start position:0%
delay committing to one group
until

06:02:03.410 --> 06:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
until
 
06:02:05.690 --> 06:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
right up until the last minute I don't
 
06:02:08.090 --> 06:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear anything specific on that
 
06:02:10.150 --> 06:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
um I'll say is that
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
apparently other states have much more
 
06:02:12.600 --> 06:02:14.090 align:start position:0%
apparently other states have much more
onerous

06:02:14.090 --> 06:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
onerous
 
06:02:15.948 --> 06:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh bills that even have things like
 
06:02:17.330 --> 06:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
price controls which I would never
 
06:02:21.230 --> 06:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
support and but they are apparently able
 
06:02:21.240 --> 06:02:22.190 align:start position:0%
support and but they are apparently able
to

06:02:22.190 --> 06:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:02:25.430 --> 06:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
staff so I would not expect that this
 
06:02:33.288 --> 06:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:35.208 --> 06:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments on the
 
06:02:35.218 --> 06:02:38.330 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments on the
amendment

06:02:38.330 --> 06:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:41.628 --> 06:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you on page
 
06:02:43.970 --> 06:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
two line
 
06:02:47.208 --> 06:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
12. just when it says they would not be
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
able to charge a higher rate unless
 
06:02:49.910 --> 06:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
06:02:51.948 --> 06:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
state or local Declaration of a public
 
06:02:54.170 --> 06:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
health emergency who at the local level
 
06:02:58.610 --> 06:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:03.170 --> 06:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
oh local level if you're
 
06:03:05.628 --> 06:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the localities have an
 
06:03:07.368 --> 06:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
opportunity to declare a state of
 
06:03:09.470 --> 06:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
emergency they do they can oh okay I
 
06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
think I think for example they they said
 
06:03:13.368 --> 06:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
there's measles running around Hampton
 
06:03:13.378 --> 06:03:15.590 align:start position:0%
there's measles running around Hampton
and

06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
so that uh which is a communicable virus
 
06:03:23.090 --> 06:03:23.100 align:start position:0%
and they that would apply follow-up
 
06:03:24.770 --> 06:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if that's an end run
 
06:03:27.948 --> 06:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
around the idea of keeping rates down so
 
06:03:29.570 --> 06:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
for instance let's say a town wants to
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
declare a public health emergency that
 
06:03:32.868 --> 06:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
they can't find people to nurse man the
 
06:03:36.110 --> 06:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
nursing home no okay so if I can comment
 
06:03:38.090 --> 06:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
please I mean there's nothing in this
 
06:03:40.128 --> 06:03:40.138 align:start position:0%
bill that prevents them from charging
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
anything they want separate from the
 
06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
issue of a bump for an infectious
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
disease so
 
06:03:48.650 --> 06:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
if they if if they're they want to if
 
06:03:50.810 --> 06:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
the you know the best one out there is
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
offering an extremely high rate then
 
06:03:56.270 --> 06:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
um you know that can happen and they
 
06:03:58.730 --> 06:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
don't have to use the uh infectious
 
06:04:05.930 --> 06:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.270 --> 06:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
it just eliminates that one reason for
 
06:04:12.170 --> 06:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
for uh for a temp for a spike in prices
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
you have to negotiate your exorbitant
 
06:04:17.628 --> 06:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
rate in advance and if your concern is
 
06:04:17.638 --> 06:04:18.770 align:start position:0%
rate in advance and if your concern is
that

06:04:18.770 --> 06:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency would be
 
06:04:22.250 --> 06:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
used to
 
06:04:23.948 --> 06:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
allow it
 
06:04:27.770 --> 06:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
I don't see how the local
 
06:04:27.780 --> 06:04:28.430 align:start position:0%
I don't see how the local
um

06:04:28.430 --> 06:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:30.288 --> 06:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
Board of Health or whatever it is would
 
06:04:32.090 --> 06:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
have an incentive to do that right I
 
06:04:33.770 --> 06:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
mean it wouldn't be in their benefit to
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
do it and so I I really don't expect
 
06:04:37.490 --> 06:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
that to happen you'd have to have a
 
06:04:41.208 --> 06:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
nursing home in that Community right and
 
06:04:42.948 --> 06:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
why would that don't work I don't see
 
06:04:44.930 --> 06:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
how it could be in the interest of the
 
06:04:46.850 --> 06:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
local public health people would be the
 
06:04:48.770 --> 06:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
Opposites I mean I can't see them doing
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
it for that reason okay representative
 
06:04:54.110 --> 06:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
FYI most towns
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
do have a public health officer which is
 
06:05:00.288 --> 06:05:00.298 align:start position:0%
often in small smaller towns often
 
06:05:04.070 --> 06:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
double duty of the fire chief and that's
 
06:05:08.208 --> 06:05:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:10.368 --> 06:05:10.378 align:start position:0%
they might or the one of the Selectmen
 
06:05:12.530 --> 06:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
gets tagged with it
 
06:05:14.448 --> 06:05:14.458 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else have a comment
 
06:05:17.570 --> 06:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
concern representative Gould I just will
 
06:05:19.250 --> 06:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
add that you would have to have the
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
local officials in cahoots with the
 
06:05:22.910 --> 06:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
nursing like it would have to be a major
 
06:05:22.920 --> 06:05:28.548 align:start position:0%
nursing like it would have to be a major
conspiracy

06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:31.250 --> 06:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
well they could but but as but as
 
06:05:33.230 --> 06:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative leckis pointed out it's
 
06:05:36.530 --> 06:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
not to the benefit of the local official
 
06:05:40.368 --> 06:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
to let the agency charge more to their
 
06:05:44.208 --> 06:05:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:45.708 --> 06:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:05:48.590 --> 06:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
06:05:51.288 --> 06:05:51.298 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is to adopt Amendment
 
06:05:51.298 --> 06:05:53.510 align:start position:0%

representative

06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
I move auto pass on House Bill
 
06:06:42.830 --> 06:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
I mean out a pass with Amendment on
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 149.
 
06:06:49.128 --> 06:06:49.138 align:start position:0%
Senate bill Senate Bill 149 excuse me
 
06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
second by representative Gould
 
06:06:53.510 --> 06:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
is there
 
06:06:55.670 --> 06:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
06:06:58.730 --> 06:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
right so this bill came to us because of
 
06:07:01.690 --> 06:07:01.700 align:start position:0%
concerns by the health care agencies
 
06:07:05.150 --> 06:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
that their staff was being
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
um sent to the highest bidder
 
06:07:10.730 --> 06:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
which makes it very difficult for people
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
to control their health care and um
 
06:07:17.628 --> 06:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill does really
 
06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
um a few things number one it allows for
 
06:07:23.090 --> 06:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
a nurse agency registration in the state
 
06:07:25.788 --> 06:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
so therefore these in these companies
 
06:07:26.990 --> 06:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
that are
 
06:07:30.770 --> 06:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
providing nurse agencies to the state
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
um are on record
 
06:07:36.288 --> 06:07:36.298 align:start position:0%
the other is that it does not allow them
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
to if they've committed to a nursing
 
06:07:39.360 --> 06:07:40.368 align:start position:0%
to if they've committed to a nursing
facility

06:07:40.368 --> 06:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
um remove that assist that that nurse to
 
06:07:47.150 --> 06:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
another facility
 
06:07:49.788 --> 06:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
because the other facility has outbid
 
06:07:51.530 --> 06:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
the current facility
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
and also importantly the nursing
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
agencies cannot place
 
06:08:00.230 --> 06:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
and license individuals with a license
 
06:08:02.448 --> 06:08:02.458 align:start position:0%
that has been suspended
 
06:08:07.390 --> 06:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:12.650 --> 06:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
help a local nursing facilities and
 
06:08:15.170 --> 06:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
which should help at least keep track of
 
06:08:17.628 --> 06:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
the rising costs of
 
06:08:27.230 --> 06:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:29.510 --> 06:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I'll make an argument for it
 
06:08:31.250 --> 06:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's slightly different I don't have a
 
06:08:32.930 --> 06:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
problem with things going to the highest
 
06:08:34.490 --> 06:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
bidder the way to solve that is get more
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
Supply however
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
what they're apparently doing is coming
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
to an agreement on a price for a nurse
 
06:08:43.548 --> 06:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
and then at the last minute saying oh
 
06:08:45.170 --> 06:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
well we have a better offer somewhere
 
06:08:46.670 --> 06:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
else and that's
 
06:08:48.830 --> 06:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know at best sleazy in an ethical
 
06:08:50.628 --> 06:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
business practices and it may actually
 
06:08:53.510 --> 06:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
be a violation of their contract and we
 
06:08:55.910 --> 06:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
we asked you know during the
 
06:08:57.410 --> 06:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about
 
06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know remedies for that you know if
 
06:09:02.090 --> 06:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
it is a violation the contract could go
 
06:09:03.410 --> 06:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general and what we
 
06:09:05.390 --> 06:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
heard is that really nothing happens
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's not effective
 
06:09:09.770 --> 06:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
um and it's largely for that reason I
 
06:09:12.890 --> 06:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
was willing to support this
 
06:09:14.510 --> 06:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and I mean the part about
 
06:09:16.970 --> 06:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know say placing nurses with
 
06:09:18.470 --> 06:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
suspended license I mean that's illegal
 
06:09:21.410 --> 06:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
already it's just the nursing agency can
 
06:09:23.750 --> 06:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
be on the hook for doing it
 
06:09:26.448 --> 06:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
and I I asked about enforcement because
 
06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
we do things that there's no way to
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
enforce it it's pointless um
 
06:09:33.310 --> 06:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
and we were told that
 
06:09:36.190 --> 06:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
you know that that
 
06:09:39.230 --> 06:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
oplc can can talk to them about a go
 
06:09:41.770 --> 06:09:41.780 align:start position:0%
after them but
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately they could either be fined or
 
06:09:46.910 --> 06:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited from Contracting in the state
 
06:09:49.010 --> 06:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
and so that would act as a pretty strong
 
06:09:49.020 --> 06:09:50.330 align:start position:0%
and so that would act as a pretty strong
disincentive

06:09:50.330 --> 06:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
disincentive
 
06:09:52.368 --> 06:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
for this kind of thing
 
06:09:56.330 --> 06:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
and the deal about prohibiting
 
06:10:00.590 --> 06:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
the up charge for infectious diseases
 
06:10:03.230 --> 06:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
I don't I mean I kind of prefer that
 
06:10:04.730 --> 06:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
wasn't in there and in general I prefer
 
06:10:06.288 --> 06:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
that this was handled through contract
 
06:10:09.410 --> 06:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
and and consumer protection stuff but
 
06:10:11.330 --> 06:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
apparently that isn't working
 
06:10:14.330 --> 06:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think the upcharge thing is
 
06:10:16.548 --> 06:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
that significant because I mean there
 
06:10:17.930 --> 06:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
they were doing it again at the last
 
06:10:19.850 --> 06:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
minute which is not the way to do
 
06:10:19.860 --> 06:10:21.110 align:start position:0%
minute which is not the way to do
business

06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:10:23.208 --> 06:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
there's also a Prohibition against
 
06:10:26.330 --> 06:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
recruiting on the grounds of the
 
06:10:26.340 --> 06:10:27.470 align:start position:0%
recruiting on the grounds of the
facility

06:10:27.470 --> 06:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:10:30.170 --> 06:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
and I think that's
 
06:10:32.330 --> 06:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
I think you know almost meaningless to
 
06:10:33.708 --> 06:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
get a hold of somebody in other
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances so I don't care too much
 
06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
about that but it's basically I think uh
 
06:10:42.708 --> 06:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
bad business practices and possibly
 
06:10:44.510 --> 06:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
contract violations while I was willing
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
to support it
 
06:10:48.410 --> 06:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay well I mean the thing is the
 
06:10:50.650 --> 06:10:50.660 align:start position:0%
reality is that none of this may be
 
06:10:53.628 --> 06:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
effective in preventing this situation
 
06:10:56.810 --> 06:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
it does give some kind of possibility of
 
06:11:00.350 --> 06:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
slowing inhibiting it or sanctioning it
 
06:11:02.750 --> 06:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
after the fact but it's better than
 
06:11:07.610 --> 06:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:09.770 --> 06:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
yeah just briefly I mean this is not
 
06:11:13.490 --> 06:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
going to fix the underlying problem of
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
um you know facilities having to pay a
 
06:11:17.690 --> 06:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money to get nurses uh to
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
to cover when people leave or away for
 
06:11:22.070 --> 06:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
some reason the only solution of that
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
long term is to increase the supply and
 
06:11:26.270 --> 06:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do to help that that we
 
06:11:28.850 --> 06:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
haven't done we should but it it'll
 
06:11:31.250 --> 06:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully stop some pretty egregious
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
business practices
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhart
 
06:11:36.770 --> 06:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just following up on rep
 
06:11:39.110 --> 06:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas's comments on the
 
06:11:41.330 --> 06:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
recruitment of potential employees on
 
06:11:42.590 --> 06:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
the premise of the healthcare facility
 
06:11:44.690 --> 06:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
it just seems very vague and I think it
 
06:11:46.310 --> 06:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
could use the justification for firing
 
06:11:48.288 --> 06:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
employees that
 
06:11:50.628 --> 06:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it just seems like it's
 
06:11:52.190 --> 06:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
an unprovable thing either way there's
 
06:11:53.810 --> 06:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
no enforcement mechanism but can still
 
06:11:55.610 --> 06:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
use justification for harassing someone
 
06:11:57.170 --> 06:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
or whatever if you really want to stop
 
06:11:58.490 --> 06:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
that then we just have them all wear
 
06:12:00.350 --> 06:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
body cameras or something I mean well
 
06:12:01.970 --> 06:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's just it gets into this very weird
 
06:12:03.890 --> 06:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
big brother-esque kind of thing that's
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
my opinion thank you yes I I think that
 
06:12:08.810 --> 06:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
the main thing it will do is prevent the
 
06:12:10.910 --> 06:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
agency from posting on the employees
 
06:12:14.288 --> 06:12:14.298 align:start position:0%
bulletin board you know want more
 
06:12:17.150 --> 06:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know you you can't stop people
 
06:12:19.310 --> 06:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
talking to each other and I'm sure the
 
06:12:22.610 --> 06:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
the nurses will talk to the uh the
 
06:12:22.620 --> 06:12:24.250 align:start position:0%
the nurses will talk to the uh the
agents

06:12:24.250 --> 06:12:24.260 align:start position:0%
agents
 
06:12:26.030 --> 06:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
the world will get around the other
 
06:12:28.250 --> 06:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
thing is I mean I can't I mean the
 
06:12:30.890 --> 06:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
facilities problem is they can't recruit
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
and retain enough nurses I don't see
 
06:12:36.288 --> 06:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
that they would be using the fact that
 
06:12:39.110 --> 06:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who works there talked to one
 
06:12:41.930 --> 06:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
of the contracted nurses about a job as
 
06:12:43.610 --> 06:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
a reason to fire them because their
 
06:12:45.590 --> 06:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
problem is they don't want them to leave
 
06:12:48.410 --> 06:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
so I I just don't see it as a real
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
06:12:49.680 --> 06:12:51.070 align:start position:0%
problem so
okay

06:12:51.070 --> 06:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:54.470 --> 06:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:57.830 --> 06:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:00.650 --> 06:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
I I like to believe that I always have a
 
06:13:02.570 --> 06:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
problem when we pass a law that's
 
06:13:02.580 --> 06:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
problem when we pass a law that's
unenforceable

06:13:05.030 --> 06:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
06:13:05.040 --> 06:13:07.190 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
um

06:13:07.190 --> 06:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so like in the situation where
 
06:13:11.448 --> 06:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to talk to other
 
06:13:11.458 --> 06:13:15.230 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to talk to other
employees

06:13:15.230 --> 06:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
I don't see how that's
 
06:13:19.368 --> 06:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
enforceable at all
 
06:13:22.910 --> 06:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh nor do I see a nursing home wanting
 
06:13:25.730 --> 06:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
to enforce that
 
06:13:27.610 --> 06:13:27.620 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
06:13:30.590 --> 06:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
the nursing the nurse agency should not
 
06:13:33.170 --> 06:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
commit to Services of a single nurse etc
 
06:13:36.530 --> 06:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
etc that's on uh second page two of the
 
06:13:42.770 --> 06:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:47.150 --> 06:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:48.770 --> 06:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
I believe it was the director of a
 
06:13:50.448 --> 06:13:50.458 align:start position:0%
nursing home maybe Hillsborough I'm not
 
06:13:53.628 --> 06:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
sure that he would get between a rock
 
06:13:55.310 --> 06:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
and a hard place and it'd have somebody
 
06:13:56.628 --> 06:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
lined up
 
06:13:58.850 --> 06:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
to work and they needed that body there
 
06:14:01.250 --> 06:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
to make the ratios of
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
of employees to to patients
 
06:14:05.750 --> 06:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
and at the last minute
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
that nursing agency XYZ pulls the leg up
 
06:14:12.110 --> 06:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
Monday and he has to pay extra money to
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:20.510 --> 06:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
but he has no way of punishing the
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
agency that that did that to him
 
06:14:27.310 --> 06:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
because he needs them maybe next week
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
on on the amendment
 
06:14:34.490 --> 06:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
on page page one line 29
 
06:14:34.500 --> 06:14:36.288 align:start position:0%
on page page one line 29
uh

06:14:36.288 --> 06:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:38.628 --> 06:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
the director May revoke
 
06:14:38.638 --> 06:14:39.830 align:start position:0%
the director May revoke
right

06:14:39.830 --> 06:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:14:41.390 --> 06:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's going to
 
06:14:42.890 --> 06:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
happen I don't know if that's going to
 
06:14:43.930 --> 06:14:43.940 align:start position:0%
be another
 
06:14:46.850 --> 06:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
unenforced rule
 
06:14:48.890 --> 06:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
because of the shortage and that's
 
06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's the whole problem of all this
 
06:14:53.090 --> 06:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
because we have a shortage I I get I
 
06:14:54.288 --> 06:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to be a mole
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
hill that I'm going to die on but
 
06:15:00.410 --> 06:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
it just seems uh unenfossible
 
06:15:02.090 --> 06:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:15:03.970 --> 06:15:03.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
06:15:07.548 --> 06:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
I'd have to say I I kind of agree except
 
06:15:10.490 --> 06:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
that I would imagine that the
 
06:15:14.208 --> 06:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
director of oplc would have more clout
 
06:15:16.250 --> 06:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general saying well
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
here I've got 17 verified complaints
 
06:15:20.690 --> 06:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
against this one agency
 
06:15:24.530 --> 06:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
than you know each agency each nursing
 
06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
home calling in once and saying you know
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
they they screwed me that's a that's the
 
06:15:32.448 --> 06:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
only way I think it's likely to get more
 
06:15:36.288 --> 06:15:36.298 align:start position:0%
enforced is if we can consolidate the
 
06:15:39.170 --> 06:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
complaints and then sick the AG on them
 
06:15:39.180 --> 06:15:40.430 align:start position:0%
complaints and then sick the AG on them
because

06:15:40.430 --> 06:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:15:42.770 --> 06:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
that'll that would make it more likely
 
06:15:44.750 --> 06:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
that something might happen
 
06:15:44.760 --> 06:15:47.990 align:start position:0%
that something might happen
but

06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:52.070 --> 06:15:52.080 align:start position:0%

06:19:30.110 --> 06:19:30.120 align:start position:0%

okay

06:19:36.250 --> 06:19:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:39.410 --> 06:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
so representative Simon has seconded my
 
06:19:39.420 --> 06:19:40.548 align:start position:0%
so representative Simon has seconded my
motion

06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:19:40.558 --> 06:19:42.288 align:start position:0%
motion
and

06:19:42.288 --> 06:19:42.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is
 
06:19:49.850 --> 06:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
simply delete the study committee on
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
licensure mental health professionals
 
06:19:55.970 --> 06:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
since we're doing that all over the
 
06:19:58.490 --> 06:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
place in subcommittees and retain bills
 
06:20:00.350 --> 06:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to create a formal
 
06:20:00.360 --> 06:20:02.150 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to create a formal
committee

06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
but we didn't get much testimony about
 
06:20:09.770 --> 06:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
the medical and Trauma services
 
06:20:12.770 --> 06:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
so I thought we should at least discuss
 
06:20:14.930 --> 06:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
it and see if it's important
 
06:20:16.430 --> 06:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
I have nothing else to say
 
06:20:18.530 --> 06:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
06:20:21.110 --> 06:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
I have nothing to add thank you
 
06:20:23.510 --> 06:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
does anyone know anything about the peer
 
06:20:29.930 --> 06:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:33.350 --> 06:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
or remember any testimony about it
 
06:20:35.750 --> 06:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gould
 
06:20:35.760 --> 06:20:39.948 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gould
please

06:20:39.948 --> 06:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:42.230 --> 06:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
sorry I know a little bit about him it's
 
06:20:46.610 --> 06:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
sort of anecdotal information as a
 
06:20:50.090 --> 06:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh I know a family member is a client
 
06:20:53.448 --> 06:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
and then a friend is a staff so
 
06:20:53.458 --> 06:20:57.350 align:start position:0%
and then a friend is a staff so
um

06:20:57.350 --> 06:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:59.510 --> 06:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
all I can tell you is it's a it's an
 
06:21:02.270 --> 06:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
important and emerging I think aspect to
 
06:21:05.208 --> 06:21:05.218 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services by allowing uh
 
06:21:08.208 --> 06:21:08.218 align:start position:0%
people who are doing well in their life
 
06:21:09.650 --> 06:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
but who have had experience and
 
06:21:11.930 --> 06:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
understanding to be able to be employed
 
06:21:14.208 --> 06:21:14.218 align:start position:0%
to assist and I can give you an example
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
the peer support people were being
 
06:21:19.730 --> 06:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
called upon when we had
 
06:21:22.190 --> 06:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
um a crate I think it was about four
 
06:21:25.250 --> 06:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
weeks ago there was a crazy amount of
 
06:21:27.170 --> 06:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
um actively psychotic people being
 
06:21:30.048 --> 06:21:30.058 align:start position:0%
warehoused in the Concord Hospital and
 
06:21:33.048 --> 06:21:33.058 align:start position:0%
so they had actively people in active
 
06:21:35.930 --> 06:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
psychosis strapped on gurneys sitting
 
06:21:38.448 --> 06:21:38.458 align:start position:0%
around in the halls and so this peer
 
06:21:40.548 --> 06:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
support group was able to be called upon
 
06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
to come in to help
 
06:21:46.270 --> 06:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
um assist with with keeping the clients
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
calm until
 
06:21:51.190 --> 06:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
something better could be figured out
 
06:21:53.330 --> 06:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
but anyway so those are the kind of
 
06:21:55.610 --> 06:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
services that they provide
 
06:21:58.250 --> 06:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
all right I'm thank you for
 
06:22:00.110 --> 06:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yeah my
 
06:22:01.910 --> 06:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
understanding I mean I I think I was out
 
06:22:03.530 --> 06:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
sick today this had a hearing although I
 
06:22:06.110 --> 06:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
guess there wasn't much presented but in
 
06:22:08.510 --> 06:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
looking it over I'm not sure it would
 
06:22:10.570 --> 06:22:10.580 align:start position:0%
apply in that case it seems to be
 
06:22:13.670 --> 06:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
support of um
 
06:22:13.680 --> 06:22:15.310 align:start position:0%
support of um
other

06:22:15.310 --> 06:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:22:17.948 --> 06:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
employees as opposed to
 
06:22:20.750 --> 06:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
patients in the hospital setting like
 
06:22:20.760 --> 06:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
patients in the hospital setting like
that

06:22:21.590 --> 06:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:25.850 --> 06:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
my question is assuming that's correct
 
06:22:28.970 --> 06:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
I mean there's no money for this so is
 
06:22:28.980 --> 06:22:29.810 align:start position:0%
I mean there's no money for this so is
there

06:22:29.810 --> 06:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:22:32.030 --> 06:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
anything right now that would prohibit
 
06:22:34.310 --> 06:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
let's say a fire department or a police
 
06:22:36.410 --> 06:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
department or
 
06:22:39.350 --> 06:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
anything like anything like that or
 
06:22:41.208 --> 06:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
their unions from organizing this right
 
06:22:42.830 --> 06:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
now I mean is there really
 
06:22:45.708 --> 06:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
a need for this and and how does this do
 
06:22:50.570 --> 06:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:54.410 --> 06:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I I thank you rep I tend to agree
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
with you I don't know what it does
 
06:22:58.368 --> 06:22:58.378 align:start position:0%
represent Gould thank you I'm sorry I
 
06:23:00.048 --> 06:23:00.058 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to write my report for you
 
06:23:01.310 --> 06:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
before the end of the day and wasn't
 
06:23:03.410 --> 06:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
paying super close attention so this
 
06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
kind of support group is for
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony remember uh
 
06:23:11.690 --> 06:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
about the all the trauma that the police
 
06:23:14.390 --> 06:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
and and other First Responders are are
 
06:23:16.310 --> 06:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
serving so
 
06:23:17.930 --> 06:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
um that's what this is in reference to
 
06:23:19.490 --> 06:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
but it's the same kind of concept as
 
06:23:22.190 --> 06:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
what I was talking about it's well we we
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%

06:23:46.128 --> 06:23:46.138 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that the committee
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
may have
 
06:23:47.520 --> 06:23:49.070 align:start position:0%
may have
okay

06:23:49.070 --> 06:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:23:51.170 --> 06:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I remember
 
06:23:53.270 --> 06:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Prue was on something
 
06:23:56.150 --> 06:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
like this where they dealt with First
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
Responders who had been in traumatic
 
06:24:00.590 --> 06:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
situations correct and in um the
 
06:24:02.090 --> 06:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
organization that representative approve
 
06:24:03.708 --> 06:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
belongs to is a critical incident stress
 
06:24:05.930 --> 06:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
debriefing team so after a critical
 
06:24:07.548 --> 06:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
incident that a fire department or
 
06:24:09.410 --> 06:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
police department May deal with they
 
06:24:13.010 --> 06:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
call this team in and they have the um
 
06:24:14.750 --> 06:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
the team counsel the members that were
 
06:24:17.030 --> 06:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
involved with that directly as far as
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
peer support groups which the
 
06:24:19.850 --> 06:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters in New
 
06:24:21.770 --> 06:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have our own peer support
 
06:24:24.048 --> 06:24:24.058 align:start position:0%
team uh the International Association of
 
06:24:25.730 --> 06:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
firefighters which is the organization
 
06:24:28.010 --> 06:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
that we belong to we they have
 
06:24:30.650 --> 06:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
established a peer support program and
 
06:24:32.690 --> 06:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
the peers support the the idea of the
 
06:24:34.850 --> 06:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
peer support teams is is a one-on-one
 
06:24:37.128 --> 06:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
period peer-to-peer counseling
 
06:24:40.250 --> 06:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
so they will send our indiv our members
 
06:24:43.368 --> 06:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
to a class it's a um a couple day long
 
06:24:45.470 --> 06:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
class where we will learn how to deal
 
06:24:45.480 --> 06:24:46.368 align:start position:0%
class where we will learn how to deal
with

06:24:46.368 --> 06:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:24:49.010 --> 06:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
peer support one on one
 
06:24:51.350 --> 06:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
um and it's basically firefight in our
 
06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
situation it's firefighters helping
 
06:25:04.730 --> 06:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
authority to do that because if I if I
 
06:25:10.430 --> 06:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
understand it the current loss talks
 
06:25:10.440 --> 06:25:11.570 align:start position:0%
understand it the current loss talks
about

06:25:11.570 --> 06:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:25:14.030 --> 06:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's vertical incident stress management
 
06:25:15.708 --> 06:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
team is
 
06:25:18.350 --> 06:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
one or more trained volunteers including
 
06:25:21.890 --> 06:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
members of peer support groups
 
06:25:21.900 --> 06:25:23.628 align:start position:0%
members of peer support groups
um

06:25:23.628 --> 06:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:26.208 --> 06:25:26.218 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me like
 
06:25:29.110 --> 06:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
you can do this already well
 
06:25:30.850 --> 06:25:30.860 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
06:25:34.070 --> 06:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
so under the current RSA the the
 
06:25:35.628 --> 06:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
individual peer support teams are not
 
06:25:38.510 --> 06:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
covered and that the
 
06:25:41.690 --> 06:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:45.410 --> 06:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:47.030 --> 06:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
you mean they're not they're not
 
06:25:49.788 --> 06:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
codified is that what you mean
 
06:25:51.350 --> 06:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what was that representative
 
06:25:54.650 --> 06:25:54.660 align:start position:0%
I'm over here I'm sorry they're not it's
 
06:25:56.510 --> 06:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
not they're not codified or defined
 
06:25:56.520 --> 06:26:00.410 align:start position:0%
not they're not codified or defined
correct

06:26:00.410 --> 06:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:03.470 --> 06:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
if I could help please
 
06:26:05.390 --> 06:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
so when um
 
06:26:08.150 --> 06:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
there is I appear with you
 
06:26:08.160 --> 06:26:08.990 align:start position:0%
there is I appear with you
um

06:26:08.990 --> 06:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:10.970 --> 06:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
can be done many ways
 
06:26:13.368 --> 06:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways that it's done
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
professionally in the Mental Health
 
06:26:19.548 --> 06:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
Board mental health area is when you
 
06:26:21.470 --> 06:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
have social workers who work for the
 
06:26:23.090 --> 06:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
same practice
 
06:26:25.670 --> 06:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
and they see different cases but
 
06:26:29.990 --> 06:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes they need confirmation from
 
06:26:33.770 --> 06:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
their fellow social workers that indeed
 
06:26:35.330 --> 06:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
they're following the right course of
 
06:26:37.610 --> 06:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
practice I mean doctors do this too I
 
06:26:39.470 --> 06:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
mean they have case reviews where they
 
06:26:41.150 --> 06:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
all sit around the table and they talk
 
06:26:43.128 --> 06:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
about someone's medical condition just
 
06:26:45.170 --> 06:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the condition that the
 
06:26:48.230 --> 06:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
the the protocol that's been outlined
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
for that individual is the correct one
 
06:26:52.610 --> 06:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
is the most likely to succeed
 
06:26:56.810 --> 06:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
so when this is done on this kind of a
 
06:26:56.820 --> 06:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
so when this is done on this kind of a
basis

06:26:59.030 --> 06:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
basis
 
06:27:01.430 --> 06:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
is done with individuals for example
 
06:27:03.288 --> 06:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
like firefighters it could be with
 
06:27:05.330 --> 06:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
individuals who
 
06:27:08.448 --> 06:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
um are handling
 
06:27:10.850 --> 06:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
um an issue with the town I guess
 
06:27:10.860 --> 06:27:13.628 align:start position:0%
um an issue with the town I guess
representative

06:27:13.628 --> 06:27:13.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:27:16.970 --> 06:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's Amendment
 
06:27:19.128 --> 06:27:19.138 align:start position:0%
addresses this and this was in the
 
06:27:22.070 --> 06:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
original Bill what her Amendment does is
 
06:27:24.110 --> 06:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates the commission
 
06:27:27.170 --> 06:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
and just keeps the original part of the
 
06:27:27.180 --> 06:27:29.090 align:start position:0%
and just keeps the original part of the
bill

06:27:29.090 --> 06:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:27:31.250 --> 06:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know why did you do that
 
06:27:33.350 --> 06:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to why did you you kept this
 
06:27:36.288 --> 06:27:36.298 align:start position:0%
because because we didn't get any
 
06:27:38.868 --> 06:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
testimony on it that's right and I
 
06:27:40.850 --> 06:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
thought it might be important and I
 
06:27:45.110 --> 06:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
figured we should at least I'm not
 
06:27:47.270 --> 06:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not willing to say I'm strongly in
 
06:27:49.910 --> 06:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
support of it but I'm much more in
 
06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:56.030 --> 06:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
me okay I'm gonna can I oh sorry no
 
06:27:58.190 --> 06:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
comment on that please continue okay so
 
06:28:00.110 --> 06:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
I was on the study committee
 
06:28:03.230 --> 06:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
and I am in support of study committee
 
06:28:05.208 --> 06:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
um because um and I think that this was
 
06:28:07.310 --> 06:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
brought out as a result of some of the
 
06:28:09.048 --> 06:28:09.058 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had in study committee
 
06:28:11.090 --> 06:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
and frankly I was more focused on the
 
06:28:12.590 --> 06:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
study committee than I was on this part
 
06:28:16.368 --> 06:28:16.378 align:start position:0%
so this sort of caught me by surprise
 
06:28:17.690 --> 06:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:28:22.430 --> 06:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:22.440 --> 06:28:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:28:23.270 --> 06:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:29.448 --> 06:28:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:33.288 --> 06:28:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I will say that I took out
 
06:28:39.048 --> 06:28:39.058 align:start position:0%
the study committee because we have
 
06:28:42.410 --> 06:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
at least one retained Bill and pieces of
 
06:28:47.030 --> 06:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and House Bill 655 that we
 
06:28:50.448 --> 06:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
are looking at and specifically on the
 
06:28:52.390 --> 06:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
licensure of mental health professionals
 
06:28:55.310 --> 06:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we want to create a
 
06:28:57.590 --> 06:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
separate study committee
 
06:28:59.690 --> 06:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
but when we're already looking at that
 
06:29:02.270 --> 06:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why I took the study
 
06:29:03.970 --> 06:29:03.980 align:start position:0%
committee out I'm
 
06:29:07.430 --> 06:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
didn't wasn't sure that this was useless
 
06:29:09.948 --> 06:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
so I left it so representative goalie
 
06:29:11.690 --> 06:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
you're more familiar with it thank you
 
06:29:13.548 --> 06:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
06:29:13.558 --> 06:29:14.750 align:start position:0%
madam chair
and

06:29:14.750 --> 06:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:17.628 --> 06:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
I I think if I recall correctly that the
 
06:29:20.868 --> 06:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
definition of peer support group was put
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
in place because we all know
 
06:29:25.368 --> 06:29:25.378 align:start position:0%
representative pru does this type of
 
06:29:29.930 --> 06:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
work and I think this establishes what a
 
06:29:33.048 --> 06:29:33.058 align:start position:0%
peer support group is and puts it puts
 
06:29:36.070 --> 06:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
it into the statutes and also includes
 
06:29:38.690 --> 06:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
peer support group
 
06:29:42.170 --> 06:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
for providing these services to not only
 
06:29:44.690 --> 06:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
our First Responders but anyone who may
 
06:29:47.390 --> 06:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
need their services it just increases
 
06:29:49.070 --> 06:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
the number of folks who are going to be
 
06:29:52.070 --> 06:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to provide those peer support
 
06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
um for those in need whether it's for
 
06:29:56.628 --> 06:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
Stress Management critical incident
 
06:29:59.510 --> 06:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
stress debriefing or any of that I think
 
06:30:03.170 --> 06:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
this defines what his group does and
 
06:30:05.030 --> 06:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
what his organization does and helps
 
06:30:07.810 --> 06:30:07.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:10.430 --> 06:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
I have a question on that and I I mean I
 
06:30:13.310 --> 06:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
think the idea in doing this is great
 
06:30:15.708 --> 06:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
um but you said this would allow more
 
06:30:17.448 --> 06:30:17.458 align:start position:0%
people to get involved if I heard you
 
06:30:17.458 --> 06:30:18.350 align:start position:0%
people to get involved if I heard you
correctly

06:30:18.350 --> 06:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
06:30:20.090 --> 06:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
I mean what's preventing them without
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
this from doing it I don't
 
06:30:24.650 --> 06:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
I would think that
 
06:30:26.208 --> 06:30:26.218 align:start position:0%
any fire department any police
 
06:30:28.570 --> 06:30:28.580 align:start position:0%
department and maybe other organizations
 
06:30:32.390 --> 06:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
or the unions in conjunction with them
 
06:30:34.788 --> 06:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
could do this kind of thing and I'm some
 
06:30:36.708 --> 06:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
I'm just reluctant to put things in
 
06:30:38.868 --> 06:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
statute that aren't really necessary or
 
06:30:40.548 --> 06:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
that might
 
06:30:43.490 --> 06:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
kind of fossilizes things in a certain
 
06:30:45.650 --> 06:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
State and might reduce some flexibility
 
06:30:47.810 --> 06:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm really wondering I think I had
 
06:30:50.750 --> 06:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
been explanation okay okay so according
 
06:30:53.810 --> 06:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
to RSA 281
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
Dash a colon 2.
 
06:30:58.970 --> 06:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
it defines
 
06:30:58.980 --> 06:31:01.628 align:start position:0%
it defines
emergency

06:31:01.628 --> 06:31:01.638 align:start position:0%

06:31:04.730 --> 06:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
281-a colon 2.
 
06:31:08.030 --> 06:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
13 yes right
 
06:31:13.070 --> 06:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
it that means it's been defined as call
 
06:31:15.948 --> 06:31:15.958 align:start position:0%

06:31:41.208 --> 06:31:41.218 align:start position:0%
any other organization cannot

participate or cannot be considered this
 
06:31:46.850 --> 06:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
under that RSA
 
06:31:49.610 --> 06:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
is that correct as to where I am is that
 
06:31:52.010 --> 06:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
correct yes that is correct and it's for
 
06:31:58.548 --> 06:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:02.750 --> 06:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
liability I forgot that part right so it
 
06:32:05.510 --> 06:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
says the critical so
 
06:32:05.520 --> 06:32:08.448 align:start position:0%
says the critical so
um

06:32:08.448 --> 06:32:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:12.170 --> 06:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
and then in rsa153 a
 
06:32:14.690 --> 06:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
colon 17 it reads critical incidence
 
06:32:17.930 --> 06:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
stress management team or team means the
 
06:32:19.910 --> 06:32:19.920 align:start position:0%

06:32:22.310 --> 06:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
including members of peer support groups
 
06:32:24.770 --> 06:32:24.780 align:start position:0%

country County Government
 
06:32:29.690 --> 06:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
and then this is where or members of the
 
06:32:32.110 --> 06:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
Union of Emergency Response
 
06:32:35.868 --> 06:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
slash Public Safety workers as defined
 
06:32:41.270 --> 06:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
by RSA 281 colon 2 paragraph six okay
 
06:32:44.750 --> 06:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it it expands
 
06:32:48.830 --> 06:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
expansive okay yes thank you
 
06:32:48.840 --> 06:32:49.850 align:start position:0%
expansive okay yes thank you
um

06:32:49.850 --> 06:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:52.430 --> 06:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why we needed that
 
06:32:52.440 --> 06:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
so that's why we needed that
but

06:32:53.990 --> 06:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:32:55.788 --> 06:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
I guess we're waiting on this but I
 
06:32:59.090 --> 06:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
would like to I will be voting no
 
06:33:01.970 --> 06:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
because I want the whole bill I want to
 
06:33:03.470 --> 06:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
study Commission because being on the
 
06:33:06.470 --> 06:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
city commission which meant quite we met
 
06:33:10.250 --> 06:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
sick four times just to address
 
06:33:10.260 --> 06:33:11.270 align:start position:0%
sick four times just to address
um

06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:14.208 --> 06:33:14.218 align:start position:0%
the issues that had to do with licensing
 
06:33:17.570 --> 06:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
and certification of of those
 
06:33:20.208 --> 06:33:20.218 align:start position:0%
individuals who are in who are working
 
06:33:20.218 --> 06:33:21.230 align:start position:0%
individuals who are in who are working
with

06:33:21.230 --> 06:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:33:23.930 --> 06:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
um mental health care and there were
 
06:33:26.810 --> 06:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
still and many of the
 
06:33:26.820 --> 06:33:27.730 align:start position:0%
still and many of the
um

06:33:27.730 --> 06:33:27.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:30.470 --> 06:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
issues are going to be addressed in
 
06:33:33.770 --> 06:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
House Bill oops not the house bill in
 
06:33:36.530 --> 06:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
the non-germaine amendment to House Bill
 
06:33:36.540 --> 06:33:38.390 align:start position:0%
the non-germaine amendment to House Bill
518

06:33:38.390 --> 06:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
518
 
06:33:41.330 --> 06:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
as we refer to that house bill never to
 
06:33:43.548 --> 06:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
be named and then
 
06:33:46.430 --> 06:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
um we will um continue we want to
 
06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
continue that work because we felt that
 
06:33:50.750 --> 06:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
we had more information did you want to
 
06:33:58.150 --> 06:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:00.650 --> 06:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Representatives my
 
06:34:02.030 --> 06:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
name is Marissa Chase I'm the executive
 
06:34:02.810 --> 06:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire

the trial lawyers
 
06:34:08.750 --> 06:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
um Senator bird so working with our
 
06:34:10.970 --> 06:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
um one of our members who exclusively
 
06:34:12.170 --> 06:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
does workers comp on behalf of
 
06:34:14.170 --> 06:34:14.180 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs and often works with pffnh
 
06:34:16.430 --> 06:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
Senator birdsold asked for help around
 
06:34:19.548 --> 06:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
this language so I apologize
 
06:34:21.170 --> 06:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
um Senator Birdsall had reached out to
 
06:34:22.730 --> 06:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
this attorney for help with this
 
06:34:24.590 --> 06:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
language and I have a note on why it's
 
06:34:26.270 --> 06:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
important if that would be helpful for
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
the committee please
 
06:34:28.080 --> 06:34:28.970 align:start position:0%
the committee please
um

06:34:28.970 --> 06:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:31.548 --> 06:34:31.558 align:start position:0%
so if I can get my phone to cooperate
 
06:34:33.170 --> 06:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
here okay
 
06:34:35.570 --> 06:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
so critical incident stress management
 
06:34:37.610 --> 06:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
team or team means the group of one or
 
06:34:38.690 --> 06:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
more trained volunteers including
 
06:34:41.390 --> 06:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
members peer support groups or members
 
06:34:43.128 --> 06:34:43.138 align:start position:0%
of a union of Emergency Response Public
 
06:34:46.010 --> 06:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
Safety workers as defined by RSA 281 a
 
06:34:48.948 --> 06:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
colon 2vi which I believe was reflected
 
06:34:51.350 --> 06:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
in Senate Bill 207 as amended not in the
 
06:34:52.670 --> 06:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
original Bill there was some debate
 
06:34:54.410 --> 06:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
around the language to be able to
 
06:34:57.650 --> 06:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
Encompass peer support groups across the
 
06:34:59.690 --> 06:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
Spectrum not just you know because
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
they're defined differently in different
 
06:35:02.570 --> 06:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
areas of statute
 
06:35:05.590 --> 06:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
the above is I think a narrow definition
 
06:35:07.788 --> 06:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
definitionally limited to the classes of
 
06:35:09.470 --> 06:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
First Responders already defined by the
 
06:35:11.448 --> 06:35:11.458 align:start position:0%
workers compensation law and then only
 
06:35:13.190 --> 06:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
to establish unions of such First
 
06:35:15.288 --> 06:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
Responders this narrowly defined
 
06:35:16.910 --> 06:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
expansion eliminates any Union of
 
06:35:18.350 --> 06:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
non-first responders from coverage by
 
06:35:20.510 --> 06:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
definition and further addresses concern
 
06:35:22.730 --> 06:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
about a future expansion by avoiding
 
06:35:24.890 --> 06:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
entirely a regulatory loophole of an
 
06:35:27.230 --> 06:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens caused by any
 
06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
other employee organization applying to
 
06:35:31.010 --> 06:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
the safety commissioner for workers comp
 
06:35:32.570 --> 06:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
covers when we talk about liability
 
06:35:34.548 --> 06:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
we're talking about coverage under the
 
06:35:36.830 --> 06:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
workers compensation statute making sure
 
06:35:38.390 --> 06:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
these folks are eligible for workers
 
06:35:40.850 --> 06:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
compensation what the language is
 
06:35:42.470 --> 06:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
drafted meaning without any savings
 
06:35:44.390 --> 06:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
Clause like quote or other such
 
06:35:46.128 --> 06:35:46.138 align:start position:0%

06:35:47.628 --> 06:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
discretion of the safety commissioner
 
06:35:50.270 --> 06:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
unquote No Union Beyond those already

blessed as First Responders by RSA 281a
 
06:35:55.070 --> 06:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
can even get in the door that's why this
 
06:35:57.350 --> 06:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
is so important as a reminder the
 
06:35:59.090 --> 06:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
definition of Emergency Response Public
 
06:36:02.448 --> 06:36:02.458 align:start position:0%

Personnel so I hope I clarify that and
 
06:36:27.830 --> 06:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
didn't make it more confusing but the
 
06:36:30.288 --> 06:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
real underlying need for this is to make
 
06:36:32.270 --> 06:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
sure that these emergency peer response
 
06:36:33.650 --> 06:36:33.660 align:start position:0%

06:36:41.340 --> 06:36:45.048 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:36:45.048 --> 06:36:45.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:47.390 --> 06:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bailey
 
06:36:49.730 --> 06:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
are we expecting something to happen to
 
06:37:01.368 --> 06:37:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:02.628 --> 06:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
looks like it's a very difficult
 
06:37:05.690 --> 06:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
question no not and it's not a difficult
 
06:37:09.048 --> 06:37:09.058 align:start position:0%
question I I guess the the
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's so much as to be covered under
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
liability as well not just so much
 
06:37:17.570 --> 06:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:17.580 --> 06:37:25.510 align:start position:0%

06:37:28.010 --> 06:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
these are the people that can be in this
 
06:37:30.708 --> 06:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
group counseling or something right so I
 
06:37:32.690 --> 06:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
assume whatever's happened has happened
 
06:37:36.590 --> 06:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
this is after the fact so why is there
 
06:37:39.230 --> 06:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
some danger in doing this or so I think
 
06:37:40.730 --> 06:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
it came up in testimony and
 
06:37:42.288 --> 06:37:42.298 align:start position:0%
representative Grotto would know better
 
06:37:44.030 --> 06:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
than I but I believe what happened is
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
06:37:49.730 --> 06:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
um peer support services are given by
 
06:37:49.740 --> 06:37:50.948 align:start position:0%
um peer support services are given by
um

06:37:50.948 --> 06:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:54.110 --> 06:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
retired members that are not actively
 
06:37:55.548 --> 06:37:55.558 align:start position:0%
part of a union
 
06:37:58.190 --> 06:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
so this is making sure that they are
 
06:38:00.170 --> 06:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
covered when they're engaging in peer
 
06:38:03.170 --> 06:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
support services covered for what cover
 
06:38:05.510 --> 06:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
for workers compensation liability
 
06:38:07.310 --> 06:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that if something does
 
06:38:10.010 --> 06:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
happen then
 
06:38:12.288 --> 06:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
they're covered as well I see it's an
 
06:38:14.270 --> 06:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
incentive mechanism to be able to get
 
06:38:15.970 --> 06:38:15.980 align:start position:0%
them to engage
 
06:38:19.190 --> 06:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
counseling and then there to be sued and
 
06:38:21.470 --> 06:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
are we covered okay I understand thank
 
06:38:23.270 --> 06:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Gould do you
 
06:38:23.280 --> 06:38:23.930 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Gould do you
have

06:38:23.930 --> 06:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:38:25.970 --> 06:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
have we covered your point
 
06:38:28.368 --> 06:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
I think so and and I'm assuming like I
 
06:38:31.368 --> 06:38:31.378 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of reticence among
 
06:38:34.730 --> 06:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
the fields I'm okay I'm a big strong guy
 
06:38:37.250 --> 06:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
I don't need help or a woman and so does
 
06:38:40.190 --> 06:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
any of this language and and and making
 
06:38:42.530 --> 06:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
it defined and easier for peer support
 
06:38:45.530 --> 06:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
People Help by codifying it are we
 
06:38:47.868 --> 06:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
helping encourage departments to set up
 
06:38:49.910 --> 06:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
peer support groups
 
06:38:51.788 --> 06:38:51.798 align:start position:0%
are just protecting them
 
06:38:58.010 --> 06:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:00.350 --> 06:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
it also protects these members on the
 
06:39:05.628 --> 06:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah okay representative could you
 
06:39:10.490 --> 06:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
expand on that
 
06:39:12.230 --> 06:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
the confidential Clause what's that
 
06:39:13.850 --> 06:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
about how does it work yeah I think your
 
06:39:15.368 --> 06:39:15.378 align:start position:0%
representative for your question it
 
06:39:17.628 --> 06:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
basically it'll cover these individuals
 
06:39:18.770 --> 06:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
if they
 
06:39:18.780 --> 06:39:20.930 align:start position:0%
if they
are

06:39:20.930 --> 06:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
talking to another peer in one of these
 
06:39:27.770 --> 06:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
situations and there the peer explains
 
06:39:29.628 --> 06:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
something to them that they're going to
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
be taking into confidentiality and not
 
06:39:35.150 --> 06:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
required to report to the law
 
06:39:38.628 --> 06:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow up so where in statute
 
06:39:41.390 --> 06:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
or somewhere else does it actually
 
06:39:44.090 --> 06:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
talk about that and and indicate that
 
06:39:45.948 --> 06:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
they would then be covered by that if
 
06:39:47.990 --> 06:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
this bill became law
 
06:39:53.510 --> 06:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:53.520 --> 06:40:00.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:40:00.530 --> 06:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:02.270 --> 06:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
this is definitely more complicated than
 
06:40:05.090 --> 06:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
I thought it was when I originally came
 
06:40:06.590 --> 06:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
up with this amendment
 
06:40:10.970 --> 06:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to send at least this part
 
06:40:14.990 --> 06:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 207 to representative
 
06:40:18.530 --> 06:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:20.930 --> 06:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
and Madam chair if I may whenever that
 
06:40:23.030 --> 06:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is scheduled I'd be happy
 
06:40:25.070 --> 06:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
to make a workers comp attorney better
 
06:40:26.990 --> 06:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
answer any of your questions than John
 
06:40:29.930 --> 06:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
or I are trying to to um hopefully lend
 
06:40:31.368 --> 06:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
some clarity
 
06:40:33.170 --> 06:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
I mean that's
 
06:40:35.330 --> 06:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
I'm still still confused of whether we
 
06:40:37.310 --> 06:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
need it and what kind of liability
 
06:40:39.530 --> 06:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
issues we're dealing with but
 
06:40:42.110 --> 06:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
we'll let the subcommittee dig into it
 
06:40:43.970 --> 06:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
that's okay Madam chair I think my
 
06:40:46.190 --> 06:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is becoming slowly experts
 
06:40:49.010 --> 06:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
at work comp all of a sudden so
 
06:40:49.020 --> 06:40:50.750 align:start position:0%
at work comp all of a sudden so
congratulations

06:40:50.750 --> 06:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
06:40:53.510 --> 06:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's always good to learn things
 
06:40:55.010 --> 06:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:40:55.020 --> 06:40:57.830 align:start position:0%
all right
um

06:40:57.830 --> 06:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:59.570 --> 06:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
