where we can so with that sir please
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself thank you Mr chairman
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm Andrew Prout representing
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County District 13 the town
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
of Hudson
 
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
the most recent increase to the gas tax
 
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
known as the road toll and the rsas is
 
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
from SB 367 in 2014 when it went from 18
 
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
cents to 22.4 cents
 
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
this increase is due to automatically
 
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
expire in 2034 after the bonds for
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
widening the southern part of Interstate
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
93 are paid off
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
the premise of this bill is let's move
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
this bill would replace the missing
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
Revenue with a transfer from the general
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
fund for the 11 years between the
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
effective date and the existing law
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
there have been many ideas of gas price
 
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
relief loaded in the last two years men
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
most of them have suffered from being
 
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
described as gimmicks because they are
 
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
temporary or too expensive in the long
 
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.330 align:start position:0%
temporary or too expensive in the long
run

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
run
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
the change proposed in this bill can be
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
described as permanent
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
once the Gary goes down to 18 cents it
 
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
will stay there
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
however it's really only an advancement
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
of an existing automatic repeal so the
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
cost is temporary
 
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I thought was
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
really unfortunate about the 2014
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
increase to the gas tax was that it was
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
done right after Massachusetts also
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
increased the gas tax to 24 cents
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
coming from a board town I know that
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
having that difference between the gas
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
taxes can give New Hampshire gas
 
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
stations an advantage when people make
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
strategic choices about where to fill up
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that if this bill were to
 
00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 align:start position:0%
pass that we'd see this Behavior play
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
out in increase in volume sold in New
 
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.150 align:start position:0%
out in increase in volume sold in New
Hampshire

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
when you look at the language of the
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
bill you'll see that there's more moving
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
pieces than I just described
 
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
this is because the 4.2 cents surtax and
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 260 colon 32-a from 2014 is written
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
into the Tifa Bond contract so we can't
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
touch it without getting waiver from the
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway Administration which I
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
consider unlikely
 
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
so I worked with the legislative budget
 
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
assistant who looped in the New
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Transportation
 
00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
and developed the language in this bill
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
that reduces the base rate in RSA 26032
 
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
to 13.8 cents for an effective total
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
rate of 18 cents until 2034.
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
then in 2034 the 4.2 surtax will
 
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
automatically repeal under existing law
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill would have the base rate
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
automatically reset to back to 18 cents
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'd be happy
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%

projects I'm here today to oppose this
legislation

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
the road toll was enacted as a user fee
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
in the early 20th century
 
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
at the dawn of the automobile age
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
because of the need to build and
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
maintain roads and it was affirmed in
 
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
1923 by the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
as a user fee
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
in 2014 a bipartisan bill was signed
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
into law Senate bill 367. it was
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
sponsored by a republican a senator from
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
Derry this committee house Public Works
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
and the Ways and Means Committee jointly
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
voted 26 to 11 to modestly raise the
 
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
road toll after not raising it for 23
 
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.210 align:start position:0%
road toll after not raising it for 23
years

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
and that legislation among other things
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
as you just heard enabled the dot to
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
finally finish widening 93 from Salem to
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester which as I'm sure a lot of
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
you know was an unfunded Transportation
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
need for many many years
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
go to gasbuddy.com or any of the
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
websites out there you can see that the
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
price of gasoline after that small
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
increase was adopted actually went down
 
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and it stayed down for a
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
couple of years the cost of crude oil is
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
the number one factor in the price at
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
the pump
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
according to the U.S Energy Information
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
Administration it makes up 61 percent of
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of a price of a gallon of gas
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
that was an analysis that was done in
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
February of 2022
 
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
according to the American petroleum
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
Institute the primary factors impacting
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
gasoline prices are again Global crude
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
prices Refinery costs distribution and
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
marketing costs and then federal and
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
state taxes and the taxes are generally
 
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
reflected in the wholesale cost of the
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
gasoline that the retailers pay the
 
00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
Distributors and that's true in New
 
00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:15.230 align:start position:0%
Distributors and that's true in New
Hampshire

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh this that very topic was discussed in
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
April of last year it was front page of
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
the union leader a few at State House
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
revved up about gas tax holiday Senate
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
GOP bails on gas tax cut that if you go
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
look at that hearing it's on YouTube you
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
can see that the retailers and the
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
wholesalers came in and they said
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
there's no way to guarantee that this is
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
actually get passed on to the consumers
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
and uh representative umberger came and
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
spoke against the legislation and
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
several others did and
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
um that that issue didn't get any
 
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:50.090 align:start position:0%
um that that issue didn't get any
traction

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
traction
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
so we're opposed to this bill uh it's
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
all it's going to do is violate the user
 
00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
system user pays for the system
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
principle it's going to make things
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for your colleagues down in
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the finance committee because now we're
 
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
going to have to take General funds to
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
backfill the cost and it's really not
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
going to have any impact to the consumer
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
at the pump so we would urge you to itl
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
this this legislation thank you very
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
much thank you sir are there questions
 
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
for Mr gertruvas
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
I would like to recognize uh from New
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot Deputy Commissioner and
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:42.949 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
committee

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
Andre Briere Deputy Commissioner of Dot
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
we're speaking today in uh in opposition
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
we have three primary concerns with the
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
legislation has written uh the first is
 
00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:58.940 align:start position:0%
a uh unknowable but but non-zero effect
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
on our uh on our bond ratings uh anytime
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
guaranteed sources of revenue are
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
altered that goes in it's factored into
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
our our bond ratings we don't know
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
exactly what that effect would be uh we
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
just uh based on our our experience and
 
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
judgment uh think that there will be
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
some effect the second is uh
 
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
some modification to our Tiffy alone
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
that's that's already been mentioned
 
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:29.660 align:start position:0%
that was taken out to uh to finance I-93
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
widening the terms of which will have to
 
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
be modified if this legislation goes
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
through the effects of that could be
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
anything from uh you know a simple
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
amendment that has no effect on the
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
overall agreement to
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
some effect on the agreement we just
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't know what that would be we'd need
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
to get lock and lowered our experts to
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh to evaluate that that risk if if this
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
legislation were to pass the third
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
objection we think is is actually the
 
00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:04.339 align:start position:0%
most Salient though uh road toll
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
is gathered from our our very large
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
tourist uh population that that travels
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
the state transient Vehicles the net
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
effect of this legislation would be to
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
place more burden uh on on New Hampshire
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for maintaining our roads and
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
less burden on those who use our roads
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
for tourism and travel
 
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
and those are our primary concerns Mr
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
chairman and standing by for any
 
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.690 align:start position:0%
chairman and standing by for any
questions

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
any questions for the Deputy
 
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.069 align:start position:0%
any questions for the Deputy
Commissioner

00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioner
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
oh please
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
please yep
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
sorry about that Mr chairman I'm not
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
sure you can see me when my hand is up
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
yeah um go ahead I've got a question or
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
two for you
 
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.189 align:start position:0%
two for you
um

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
has your department figured out and have
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
an estimate of how much revenue you will
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
lose if this bill passes well as written
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
it would it would technically be Revenue
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
neutral the only change would be uh with
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
regard to the source of Revenue these
 
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
would be General funds that would be
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
applied to the highway Fund in lieu of
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh the the change you know the the Delta
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
that would be uh
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
that would be uh taken out of the road
 
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.870 align:start position:0%
that would be uh taken out of the road
tool

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
tool
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and you mentioned that it could
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
affect your bond rating how much of
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
your department income
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
with this effect and I I don't
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
understand really how it would affect
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
I would I would uh
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
get back to you on a full treatment of
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
that question sir but but based on our
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
experience whenever uh there is any sort
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
of change in dedicated Revenue that's
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
taken into account
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you represent Boger
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.310 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
the question is if we take this money
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
from the general fund to cover
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:12.019 align:start position:0%
anybody who buys gas in New Hampshire
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
pays for currently then coming out of
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
the general fund then it would only be
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
then covered by people who live in New
 
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.710 align:start position:0%
then covered by people who live in New
Hampshire

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
correct that's right and if I may add
 
00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.269 align:start position:0%
correct that's right and if I may add
continue

00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
um please so as we move the money the
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
34 million dollars out of the general
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
fund would that have an adverse effect
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
on future Highway projects that that we
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
would be sourcing to do as we try to
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
improve like uh Route 16 going north and
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
stuff because that has been on the radar
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
I do believe to expand it and if we're
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
taking money from General funds and
 
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
stuff to Now cover Highway projects
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
would that have an adverse effect trying
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
to do that no thank you for the question
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
sir I guess I would answer it in
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
with the general sense that whenever
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
dedicated revenues are taken away it
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
just makes it less predictable right we
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
we have to reassess every biennium uh
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
whether we in fact would get those funds
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated it makes long-term planning
 
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
appropriated it makes long-term planning
um

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
potentially more more tricky uh
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
again as written this bill would would
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee a replacement level for those
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
funds in which case it would be neutral
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
but like I said the source of that
 
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
Revenue would be less from from
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
out-of-staters or those using our roads
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
who aren't New Hampshire taxpayers and
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
unless for them I with regard to
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
specific projects and the impacts on
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
those that that's a bit unknowable at
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
this point if this legislation were to
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
pass we'd continue to assess that and
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
would update this committee
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
one follow-up please one last follow-up
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
um with
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
currently is the highway fund for making
 
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
Highway improvements
 
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.230 align:start position:0%
Highway improvements
above

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
at PACE or below where it should be at
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
this point in time in a year well thank
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
you sir for that question uh I think uh
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
Pro probably many members of this
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
committee are familiar with the fact
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
that long term our Highway fund
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
has a structural deficit and that's true
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
with every Highway Fund in every state
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
in the country right now and that's
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
mostly due to improving Cafe standards
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
greater efficiency in the in the uh
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel powered vehicle Fleet and
 
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
also the onboarding of more and more uh
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles onto our roads that
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
all has the net effect of decreasing
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
revenues to our Highway fund and that's
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
that's every state and that's also
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
nationally our national U.S Highway fund
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
also is suffering from that long-term
 
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
structural deficit so any decrease in
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the highway fund just
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
exacerbates that that long-term
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Juris thank you
 
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.630 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Juris thank you
Chad

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
Chad
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
how much from the road toll goes to
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
maintenance yearly maintenance of state
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
roads and highways
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
but what you can gather
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
we can catch an exact figure for that
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
sir uh right after that happy to provide
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
that but does
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
currently there are those some of those
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
monies go towards maintenance yes
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
absolutely on a yearly basis okay that
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
yeah that's our Paving program our
 
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.710 align:start position:0%

betterment
 
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.610 align:start position:0%
betterment

Dot

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm here representing Department of
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
Safety Road tool Bureau we're opposed to
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill for many of the same reasons
 
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.310 align:start position:0%
this bill for many of the same reasons
that

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Commissioner Brier just
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned we question the long-term
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
sustainability while the general fund
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
might be able to support this currently
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
is it going to in the future and that
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
could put local Highway Aid at risk in
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
future years
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
um additionally this bill does very
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
little for the consumer based on 12 000
 
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
miles per year average at an average of
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
25 miles per gallon about 480 gallons of
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
consumption on average per user per year
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
so I would say if the average consumer
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
about twenty dollars a year
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
and as we've heard there's no way for us
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
we have no price control so there's no
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
way for us to guarantee that that
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
savings actually gets passed down to the
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
retail level
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
there will be challenges with
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
implementation including how we're
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to handle the higher taxed
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
retail station inventory that will be on
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
hand once this bill goes into effect
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
retail stations will likely try to draw
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
down their higher tax inventory prior to
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
the effective date and this could cause
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
a supply issue if they all try to
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
um we also anticipate a need for at
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
least a 90-day lead time to allow for
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
proper Community communication to our
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
Distributors and Retail stations
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
and update their systems as well
 
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.610 align:start position:0%
and update their systems as well
um

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:57.299 align:start position:0%
we'd like to request that if this bill
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
does pass we extend the effective date
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
to October 1st 2023.
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
the department of safety collects a
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
certain proportion of the money
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
collected out of their old toll
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
would this legislation affect
 
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
the amount that the
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
Department either collects with that or
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
allocates for other
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
safety uh safety programs throughout the
 
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.370 align:start position:0%
safety uh safety programs throughout the
state

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
we collect the entire amount of the road
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
toll and then we pass it along to the
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
highway fund for the Department of
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation to use towards
 
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.770 align:start position:0%
Transportation to use towards
well

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
but you retain a certain portion to
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
as well don't you
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
I would have to get back to you on that
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I come to you today in
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 62.
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
I looked at this bill and I always like
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
to give a different perspective you've
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
got some great information from the
 
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:46.100 align:start position:0%
previous speakers
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
we look at it as the highway program is
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
a long program we do a 10-year Highway
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
plan you have to have consistent revenue
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
for the Department to develop a plan one
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
of the things that this does is it even
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
if it was to work like this bill says it
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
would you're switching from a long-term
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
a long-term Financial
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
consistency to having every two years
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
subject to the budget
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
and uh when I brought this forward to my
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
board they just basically said this it's
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
a bad deal it is really is not a good
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
deal to put this into the subject of the
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
state budget which it is currently not
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
um it would be a nightmare so I told the
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
board well is there a way to guarantee
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
this and I don't think you can guarantee
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
the budget process every two years from
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
one to the other I also think the
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
department of safety is correct there's
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
some timing here of money and transfers
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's pretty close that this bill would
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
go into effect by June 30th and the
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
budget happens at June 30th and the
 
00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
department of safety would be having to
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
try to lower their amount that gets
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
collected by Distributors the money
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
coming in there's a lot of different
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
issues and then the next two-year cycle
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
you would have this reduction
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
permanently in the statute while you're
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
not sure whether you would get the money
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
out of the next budget cycle
 
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind
 
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:19.580 align:start position:0%
the 4.2
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
is really part of the last tax increase
 
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
that Sunset says was discussed so we
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
have 11 years worth of Revenue to go and
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
so this really cuts it into a very
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
short-term non-guaranteed situation
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
so I also think we agree with what Alex
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
catrubus said we've studied a lot
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
the price at the pump is not necessarily
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
related to the gas tax so there isn't
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
really a correlation
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
there was a Senate bill in which the
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
Distributors from Rhode Island came in
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
and they were under political and
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
newspaper press that the prices didn't
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
drop even though they lowered the they
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
waived the gas tax during the covid
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
crisis so there is no correlation there
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
so I we looked at it tons of times New
 
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was sometimes had higher gas
 
00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:16.730 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was sometimes had higher gas
price

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
then our neighboring states that hired a
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
higher gas tax so the correlation
 
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't really relate into the
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
consumer's pocket so I would just leave
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
you with that that we would hope this
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee would not go forward with the
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
bill I think
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
it does create a lot of different issues
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
and one of the other concerns that's in
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
here is if you notice it doesn't take it
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the 4.2 that's going to Sunset it
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
takes it from the 18 cents that's been
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
there for a long time and so that in
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
itself will cause problems I believe in
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
the future because you'll have the
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
sunset and you've had reduction of 4.2
 
00:26:59.289 --> 00:26:59.299 align:start position:0%
from the 18. I can see some issues in
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
2034 which you might have to address but
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
I clearly probably won't be here
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
testifying before you in in 2034. but
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
with that I would hope the committee
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
would vote in expedient
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for Mr
 
00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:16.789 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for Mr
Abbott

00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
Abbott
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir thank you my
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
last card now
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
um is uh amby Chevrolet
 
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.350 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm terrible so I apologize Continental
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
Paving uh Amy Charbonneau from
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
Continental Paving thank you for having
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
me I'd just like to take one minute to
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
kind of take a flip look at everything
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at everything we would
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
lose I would just like to mention
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
everything that the four cents gained us
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
um if you look at 93 just personally my
 
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
dad fought 18 years to get the four
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
cents on the gas tax and what 93 has
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
brought New Hampshire we can't forget
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
about that so we're talking about
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
everything we would lose but what we
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
gain from that four cents is incredible
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
I mean all the housing that's come and
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
economic development at exit one at Exit
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
four people are coming to New Hampshire
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
because now they can they're not sitting
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
in traffic for a long period of time so
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
that four cents was huge to New
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus what the people would
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
gain at the pump which we've proven is
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
really nothing so I just wanted to take
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
one minute to take the flip side of the
 
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
positive of that four cents and how
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
amazing it has been in uh consumer
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
construction economic world for housing
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
everything I mean 93 is awesome and
 
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
nobody can really deny that and that's
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
what the four cents got us so the
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
negatives versus the positives here
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
are very drastic to us so thank you very
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
much if anybody has any questions yeah
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you yeah representative thank
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
question again
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you're everybody's saying what a
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
great loss this will be can you give me
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
an actual dollar figure on estimated
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
loss if this bill passes in a year's
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
time so again it's neutral
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
which everybody has said but the
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
difference is New Hampshire people
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
paying the full 35 million versus
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
potential out I mean look at how many
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
tourists there are that come to just the
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
hooks at toll plaza they fill their car
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
up from Massachusetts everywhere and
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
they're paying our Force you know
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
they're paying our gas tax versus
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
putting the abundance of the pain on all
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire people I mean also the
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
concern for us is the line budget like
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
we said every two years it's not a
 
00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:37.930 align:start position:0%
we said every two years it's not a
guarantee

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
yeah quick follow-up so what you're
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
saying is it's approximately 35 million
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
dollars we're talking about here yes
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and the the the other
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
benefit that has been happening is there
 
00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
has been general fund money being pushed
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
to dot to actually help with the deficit
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we are the dot is functioning like
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
we're not keeping up with the roads and
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
the maintenance as it is right now and
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
the governor and everybody have worked
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
to give like last year there was 66
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
additional million dollars given to
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
municipalities and towns so the worry is
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
that if you take 35 and you that's now a
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
line item there's no way we're getting
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
that extra 66 you know to keep up with
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
the roads because that that's a that's
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
the large number now so there's already
 
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
general fund money in the Surplus the
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
last couple years going to help the
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
D.O.T because they are functioning at a
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
very low I mean all honesty we should be
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
talking about adding four cents instead
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
of taking four cents away they're not
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
we're not keeping up with our roads and
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
our bridges and Concord and all the
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
projects they have in the 10-year plan
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
are getting pushed farther down
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
um just being pushed farther out year
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
after year so there's already not a line
 
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
item but a surplus being spent on Dot
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
that now now we're taking that general
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
fund we're putting that in there taking
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
four cents away it just and there's I
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
think it's more complicated than it
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
seems thank you uh president I just want
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
to remind you and others we have another
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
hearing starting in two minutes so be
 
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.570 align:start position:0%
hearing starting in two minutes so be
precise

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
precise
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
um do you have an idea if the cost of of
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh construction of a highway or
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
improvements to the highway have went up
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
down or oh definitely have gone up just
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
I mean the cost of Steel
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
um the escalation like last year
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
specifically what we do I can speak to
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
Asphalt because of oil has gone up went
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
up drastically Last Summer
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
the inflation that which is another huge
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
problem in the dot the funding is not
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
increasing because the gas tax and
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
people are getting more miles to the
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
gallon so the it's a declining revenue
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
for this dot at the same time inflation
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
around the world I mean our country is
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
going up 10 construction last year was
 
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
probably at 18 I mean pipe that used to
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
cost six is now 18 and New Hampshire
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
people don't have control over that
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
we're just buying it from our you know
 
00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
where we have to and labor costs are
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
going up everything's going up but at
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
the same time we're not increasing
 
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the source thank you
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes please thanks
 
00:32:11.169 --> 00:32:11.179 align:start position:0%
briefly do you see with this road toll
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
proposal do you see an impact on your
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
skilled labor construction managers Etc
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
uh being impacted
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
by this proposal I mean I don't think
 
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
this changes them because it technically
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the budget year after
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
year but it can because of that
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
additional money that we're getting I
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
the hardest part with the budget as a
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
current stands is we get surpluses which
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
are great it's like feast or famine so
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
you don't know what you're going to get
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
for a surplus one year I can employ 350
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and the next
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
year I only need 270 because you don't
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
know until there's a surplus in the
 
00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
budget that you're going to get any
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
extra money so you don't know what
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
work's going to come out you can't we
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
just want a nice you know a good Buffet
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
but you can't and we don't like to lay
 
00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:57.779 align:start position:0%
people off personally our company we
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
like to keep them employed we don't want
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
put people on employment or layoff in
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
the middle of summer but we the dot just
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
needs a consistent funding source so
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
that all the contractors in New
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which New Hampshire is very
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
unique it's full of all family
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
businesses we want to keep people
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
employed so it's just we need a
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
consistent funding source and every two
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
years again having it be a line item
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
that could get chopped is an unknown for
 
00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:21.169 align:start position:0%
that could get chopped is an unknown for
us

00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:22.250 align:start position:0%
us

I'm I currently serve Carroll County
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
District number one which is the town of
 
00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:03.170 align:start position:0%
District number one which is the town of

Conway
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce House Bill
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
480 relative to the intersection of
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
Route 302 and East Conway Road in Conway
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
and to request that this committee
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
this intersection is scheduled to be
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
rebuilt because there's been many
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
accidents there and these
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
the East Conway Road Corridor is an
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
industrial Corridor several years ago
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
the town changed the East Conway Road to
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
his own in the industrial Corridor in
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
order to attract new businesses into
 
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.970 align:start position:0%
order to attract new businesses into
that

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
that area that section of Tom
 
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
and that is what we have now
 
00:35:45.609 --> 00:35:45.619 align:start position:0%
in the industrial Zone
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
exists a landfill a landfill a transfer
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
station a gravel pit two fuel Depots and
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
these businesses draw heavy loads and
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
oversized traffic
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
and the current proposal to build around
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's a current proposal to build a
 
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.329 align:start position:0%
there's a current proposal to build a
roundabout

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
roundabout
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
but after making
 
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.829 align:start position:0%
but after making
um

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
after after going out of our way to make
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
this this industrial area in this area
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
industrial zoned industrial it doesn't
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to put this this would end up
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
being an obstacle actually at the end of
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
 
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
um

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
the trucks so I they we also had a
 
00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:40.579 align:start position:0%
demonstration on a heavy load on
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
navigating around about
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
and I witnessed one of these
 
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.490 align:start position:0%
and I witnessed one of these
demonstrations

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
demonstrations
 
00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:49.619 align:start position:0%
and there was a big heavy load and a lot
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
I think it was about an 80-foot trailer
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
uh overall 80 foot
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and the low boy was it was snapping
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
and popping and it had to go up on the
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
curb on the outside and then the the low
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
boy went across the apron and cracked
 
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:07.820 align:start position:0%
all up
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
phony the phony brick concrete
 
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.849 align:start position:0%
phony the phony brick concrete
so

00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
and and in addition to that the drivers
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
told me that no if there's a roundabout
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
no matter what it they're gonna have to
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
stop anyway so it's not going to make a
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
continuous loop of traffic because these
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
big trucks have to stop and then they
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
start up again it's they're not going to
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
just you know there's gonna it's gonna
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
cause traffic to back up in every
 
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.540 align:start position:0%
cause traffic to back up in every
direction

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.930 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.310 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
I think that uh I can try to answer some
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
questions but this there's several
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
people here that several business owners
 
00:37:52.329 --> 00:37:52.339 align:start position:0%
and residents that um have a direct
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
impact this will have a direct impact so
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
I I think I'll stop there at this point
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh represent
 
00:38:02.339 --> 00:38:03.710 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh represent
Mills

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%

this project currently on the 10-year
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
plan and you're just trying to have the
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
project itself itself altered yes thank
 
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.930 align:start position:0%
project itself itself altered yes thank
you

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
further questions by the committee
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
yes rep Sim
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Buco can you can you
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
share any light on how it is that you
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
were unable to get this modification in
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
the normal process through the regional
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission do they not agree
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
that this change should be made
 
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question okay thank
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
you anyone else for the representative
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman is this for
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
the construction of a roundabout or a
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
traditional traffic light
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
setup it's proposed around about this
 
00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
bill would be a traditional intersection
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's what this that's what this bill
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill asks for it asks
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
for a traditional intercept intersection
 
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
with with traffic signals
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.230 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record Chief Dean
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
letters from the Redstone fire
 
00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:57.380 align:start position:0%
department and I do have three concerns
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
with a roundabout
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
as far as safety goes
 
00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:05.540 align:start position:0%
versus the size of the roundabout
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
I'm more worried about large Vehicles
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
having car accidents uh Hazmat incidents
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
as far as the bulk fill facilities go
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
that are located on East Conway Road
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
which there were
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned there were two fuel
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
Depots there there's actually four bulk
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
pill facilities for liquid propane so
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
the trucks constantly come in and out of
 
00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:29.329 align:start position:0%
the trucks constantly come in and out of
there

00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:30.349 align:start position:0%
there
um

00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:32.339 align:start position:0%
as well as oil tankers coming through
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
that main route
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm more worried about a rollover with a
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
an oil tanker having a Hazmat incident I
 
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
really don't want to have to do the
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
paperwork on anything like that
 
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:46.910 align:start position:0%
paperwork on anything like that
um

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
so that's my first concern
 
00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:51.290 align:start position:0%
so that's my first concern
uh

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
second concern is a stop Gap in traffic
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
as far as 302 goes being a major road
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
living on that road and running the fire
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
department there's a ton of traffic and
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
there's a constant flow if we keep the
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
flow moving with a roundabout
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that there's issues with
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
traffic accidents on that road which are
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of traffic accidents on 302 in
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
that one area because of the flow of
 
00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.930 align:start position:0%
that one area because of the flow of
traffic

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.690 align:start position:0%
traffic
um

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
of course I said I had three issues I
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
only have two and that's that's about it
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's even better for us thank you
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
Chief is there anyone have any questions
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
for the chief
 
00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative Faulkner
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief I'm not sure I
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
understand the issue of rollover isn't
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
isn't the risk of a rollover for a Sharp
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
left turn the same or less
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
or greater than it would be with a
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
roundabout that would take a more
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
a wider turn it's uh
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
if you come to a traffic signal
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
in a bigger truck and you're you're
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
slowing down to turn right left anything
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
like that then you're coming around a
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
roundabout and depending on the size
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
they make the roundabout
 
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.089 align:start position:0%
they make the roundabout
uh

00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
I I think the rollover would be more
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
evident than that I'd heard uh issues
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
with Gorham Maine there's a large
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
roundabout where tankers were actually
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
overturning on that and of course I I'm
 
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.410 align:start position:0%
overturning on that and of course I I'm
not

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.730 align:start position:0%
not
uh

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
I just have concerns with it we'll put
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
it that way I don't have proof that it
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
would happen so
 
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
seeing no further question Chief thank
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
you for coming down thank you for having
 
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:47.390 align:start position:0%
you for coming down thank you for having
me

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:52.670 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize from dot Paul

Granary
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
am I having the wrong bill here 480 is
 
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
there someone from dot to speak town of
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
Conway perhaps Paul DeLeon I apologize
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to yes please
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
um my name is Paul De leonjali
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm the
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
Town engineer and Deputy Town manager
 
00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
for the town of Conway for these past 32
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
years I'm here this morning at the
 
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:35.339 align:start position:0%
behest of the Conway Board of selectman
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh to speak against in opposition of
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
um before I get into the reasons why
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
it seems like there was some confusion
 
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
this is an existing intersection
 
00:43:58.609 --> 00:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
of two New Hampshire Roots U.S Route 302
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
and the East Conway Road this
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
intersection has been very problematic
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
we have dozens of accidents and several
 
00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:07.670 align:start position:0%
we have dozens of accidents and several
fatalities

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
fatalities
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
we applied under the road safety program
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
and were accepted and is in design
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
as you may know and there are members
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
from dot behind me
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
when you do that
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
you look at the problem you do the
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
traffic counts you get an understanding
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
of what the problem definition is and
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
then you come up with the alternatives
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
to solve the problems
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
this is an intersection
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
there are two Alternatives it will
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
either be signalized or it'll be a
 
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.550 align:start position:0%
either be signalized or it'll be a
roundabout

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:50.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none continue thank you alignment
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Jim just
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
briefly so
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
is studying right now an intersection
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
versus around about that's correct okay
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
just a for clarity thank you you're
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the board of Selectmen who
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill they are
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
opposed for several reasons the first
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
reason is that this bill is trying to
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
legislate a design change which
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
circumvents the process
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
of studying the problem
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
gaining information holding public
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
information hearings holding public
 
00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:32.819 align:start position:0%
education hearings and ultimately
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
creating Community consensus
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
this is a process that took place
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
and it took place longer with additional
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
public hearings because of the
 
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.210 align:start position:0%
public hearings because of the
opposition

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's represented in the room today
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
in addition to the usual and customary
 
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.550 align:start position:0%
in addition to the usual and customary
process

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
you've heard representative Buco talk
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
about a demonstration not one but two
 
00:45:56.579 --> 00:45:58.490 align:start position:0%
about a demonstration not one but two
demonstrations

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
demonstrations
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
at the heart of the problem is that
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
Quarry that gains access from this road
 
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:08.579 align:start position:0%
and the Quarry will move
 
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
special permit Vehicles very large
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles and we'll need to come through
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
this intersection that is a valid
 
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.130 align:start position:0%
this intersection that is a valid
concern

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
the town of Conway has three roundabouts
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
that have been in existence in operation
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
for many years we agreed to a
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
demonstration let's take that equipment
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
that tractor trailer that lowboy with
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
that load on it and let's take it
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
through our existing roundabouts
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
our existing roundabouts mind you are
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
designed for a wb67 wheelbase 67 which
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
is the statutory allowed legal vehicle
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
not the vehicle that we will be seeing
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
to the Quarry which is done by special
 
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.130 align:start position:0%
to the Quarry which is done by special
permit

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
that particular vehicle was a WB 85.5
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
with 120 000 pound load
 
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.230 align:start position:0%
with 120 000 pound load
limit

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of vehicle that goes
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
down the road with a State Trooper
 
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
behind it and in front of it
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
I sat in the passenger seat Mr noise
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
drove Mr Noyes isn't in the room this
 
00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.069 align:start position:0%
drove Mr Noyes isn't in the room this
morning

00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
and it navigated figure ate it if you
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
will because we have two roundabouts in
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
row on our North South Road the existing
 
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.849 align:start position:0%
row on our North South Road the existing
roundabouts

00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
roundabouts
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
that was witnessed by myself Town
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
engineer PE
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
the state safety engineer Mike Dugas who
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
has since retired PE the state's chief
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
of design from Zane
 
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.650 align:start position:0%
of design from Zane
PE

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
PE
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
professional engineer and our conclusion
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
was how it works
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
it works on the smaller roundabout
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's always been the intent that the
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
roundabout at us 302
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
right Maine New Hampshire and Vermont
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
would be a larger structure
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
and it will be
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
and yet this vehicle navigated those
 
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
and yet this vehicle navigated those
roundabouts

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen are opposed to this
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
legislation because it circumvents the
 
00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.990 align:start position:0%
legislation because it circumvents the
process

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
the selectment reports this legislation
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it is not the governing body's
 
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.290 align:start position:0%
because it is not the governing body's
choice

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
I don't have more to expand on that I
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
explained the process explain the
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
multiple public hearings the two
 
00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.770 align:start position:0%
multiple public hearings the two
demonstrations

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
demonstrations
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
the arguments listened to on both sides
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
and the decision was made
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
letters were sent in as part of the
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
process to the dot I'm sure Bill
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
Oldenburg behind me can talk to that and
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
produce them a letter from the board of
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in favor of the roundabout
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
option a letter from the police chief in
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
favor of the roundabout option you heard
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
from Chief Henry
 
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
Conway has seven precincts seven fire
 
00:48:47.099 --> 00:48:49.069 align:start position:0%
Conway has seven precincts seven fire
departments

00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
we had letters from the Conway Village
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
fire department and the North Conway the
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
two larger departments in support of the
 
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
two larger departments in support of the
roundabout

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
roundabout
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
letter from the director of Public Works
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
in support of the roundabout
 
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
they Repose this legislation because
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's not the community's choice
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation is an end run it's an
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
attempt to change the outcome of the
 
00:49:11.099 --> 00:49:13.370 align:start position:0%
attempt to change the outcome of the
process

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Boris segment is opposed to this
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation for a third reason
 
00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
a signalized intersection is neither the
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
safest nor the most efficient way to
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
treat the intersection
 
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.790 align:start position:0%
treat the intersection
despite

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
despite
 
00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
National statistics insurance
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
professional societies of Engineers the
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
American Society of state and Highway
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
design officials
 
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a body
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
of statistics and results
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
that without a Shadow of Doubt
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that a roundabout is a safer
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
way to treat an intersection than a
 
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.410 align:start position:0%
way to treat an intersection than a
signal

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
signal
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
and it's more efficient
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
as I said we have three roundabouts in
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
Conway already we have lots of
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
development in traffic I've made a
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
career out of
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
doing traffic analysis and traffic
 
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.370 align:start position:0%
doing traffic analysis and traffic
studies

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
it will simply put through more traffic
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
in less time
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh questions yes oh thank you again Mr
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for appearing what's
 
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
the existing I should have asked this
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
earlier what's the existing traffic
 
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.329 align:start position:0%
 
hence

00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
hence
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
dozens of accidents and multiple
 
00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:28.190 align:start position:0%
dozens of accidents and multiple
fatalities

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
rep temperatures thank you chair thanks
 
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.030 align:start position:0%
rep temperatures thank you chair thanks
again

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
so you're studying the signalization
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
versus the roundabout in in just as an
 
00:50:40.859 --> 00:50:41.930 align:start position:0%
versus the roundabout in in just as an
aside

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
aside
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
I've heard some reports lately of
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities around the country trying
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
to move more towards roundabouts as
 
00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to certain signal
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
intersections I believe there's a and
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
you it is a town in Indiana that has
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
redone every of the intersections I'm
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
told it's the roundabout capital of the
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
world as opposed to uh and and
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
reverting them from signalized
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
intersections I heard that report lately
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
on the radio I think it was last month I
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
don't know if you if you're familiar
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:51:15.359 --> 00:51:16.370 align:start position:0%
with it
um

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
and just in my case personally I use two
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
every day in Nashua one at the high
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
school at North on Broad Street and one
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
at South Main representative you could
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
suspend for a moment a lot of that I
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
don't see a question a lot of that will
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
handle during the executive session okay
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
you got it but uh
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your thanks for your
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
your uh Mr chairman Mr Mayor I think we
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
agree with where the representative was
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
going the Selectmen are in favor of the
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
roundabout thank you sir are there
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent Burger
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh could you speak to the safety of a
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
signal intersection in reality I'm not
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
and the safety of a roundabout as people
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
are flowing have been flowing and the
 
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:14.579 align:start position:0%
actual usage of these intersections in
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
reality and not conceptually
 
00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:19.940 align:start position:0%
so in reality
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
something that engineers and insurance
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
companies like to do is collect
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
statistics roundabouts have been around
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
for many years we've had them in conwave
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
going on two decades so at a minimum in
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
and what that database will tell you
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
what the insurance companies and what
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
the professional societies of design
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
Engineers will tell you is that the
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
roundabout is a safer intersection than
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
a signalized intersection
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:53.569 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative fideli uh excuse me yes
 
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.829 align:start position:0%
representative fideli uh excuse me yes
Gaddafi

00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
Gaddafi
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
as I understand it just is just a
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
nominal section right now
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
this is a T intersection with U.S Route
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
302 being the Hat
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
and East Conway Road being the right now
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be simple to just run a test
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
for like two months with a light there
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
and answer that question for those
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
expect to the people that are opposing
 
00:53:25.859 --> 00:53:26.750 align:start position:0%
expect to the people that are opposing
this

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the representatives
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
questions sir uh represent as I
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
understand Representatives asking if you
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
could do a temporary traffic light there
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
to uh to gauge
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh the effective use of that
 
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.589 align:start position:0%
uh the effective use of that
intersection

00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
anything could be done but
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
I don't see I don't see the point
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
represent Khan
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question now is this going to
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
be a single lane or a double lane
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
roundabout this is a single Lane
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
roundabout okay thank you
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
yes represent Faulkner thank you uh
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that in the long term it's
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
you can save money with an operations
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
cost with around about
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
compared to a signalized intersection
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
I don't have that info I'm sorry I can't
 
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
answer that question I'm not sure about
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the dot folks can
 
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.049 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the dot folks can
sure

00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
sir for your testimony thank you thank
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize uh Jeff Burke from
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
Mr Burke it's nice to have you here in
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
our committee it's nice to put a name
 
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
with the face please continue thank you
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
I'm Jeff Burke I am the Corey owner
 
00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
um I am in support of this bill
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm not dead against a roundabout and
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we have to have a traffic
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
signal I just don't believe that the
 
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
roundabout that they're proposing is big
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
enough for the
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
um equipment that we're running through
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
this roundabout we we just talked about
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
the demonstrations we did
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
um we didn't mention that
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
the excessive wear to the tires that are
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
left on these radiuses
 
00:55:36.059 --> 00:55:37.910 align:start position:0%
left on these radiuses
and

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
um the popping and twisting of the
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
frames of these large pieces of
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
equipment that we're moving in the
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
excessive wear on these trucks that
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
they're getting going through these
 
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.170 align:start position:0%
they're getting going through these
roundabouts

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
roundabouts
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I put we're putting a pile of big
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
trucks through there and it does slow
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
down so I think if we could put a
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
roundabout in and it could be big enough
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
I think that's fine if we can't get a
 
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
big enough roundabout then we need to go
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
with a traffic signal
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions Mr Burke
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
below thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
you for testifying uh how many loads a
 
00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
day a week what's the rate in the
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
summertime where averaging round trips
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
of about 300 trucks a day just coming
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
from our Quarry
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
going through that intersection
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up and that's the you're talking
 
00:56:31.569 --> 00:56:31.579 align:start position:0%
about the big trucks those are correct
 
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
dump trucks um trailer dumps and then
 
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:39.059 align:start position:0%
um equipment that we move
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you one one more please just
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify so it's 300 but I I think the
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
issue is about the really big the really
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
big ones how many of those
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
um probably a couple loads from us daily
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
and then there's obviously your logging
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
trucks the fuel trucks coming in and out
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you would have a
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
but if I could follow up for that for
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
your extremely large loads which I'm I'm
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
guessing are probably bringing Crushers
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
in and out or something like that
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
Crushers excavators that that's not a
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
date that's not daily okay I mean some
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
of them I mean it's it's steady but it's
 
00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
not daily yeah thank you further
 
00:57:19.619 --> 00:57:22.549 align:start position:0%
not daily yeah thank you further
questions

00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry representative yes thank
 
00:57:25.559 --> 00:57:26.770 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry representative yes thank
you

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:26.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
so when the demonstration was done this
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
was on the proposed larger sized
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
roundabout no I believe it was 10 feet
 
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.870 align:start position:0%
roundabout no I believe it was 10 feet
smaller

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:40.809 --> 00:57:40.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
follow up could you give me a mental
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
picture of of this so are we talking
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
diameter width of the roads it would be
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
diameter of the
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100 sure how to explain that but
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
it would be 10 feet bigger in a circle
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
all the way around it all right thank
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
seeing no further question thank you sir
 
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
I would like to uh recognize Bill
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Bill Oldenburg I'm
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
the assistant director of project
 
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:29.780 align:start position:0%
development at the DOT
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the department I'd like to
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to House Bill 480
 
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
for a couple reasons
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
um as as you've heard this bill or this
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
this intersection already exists in the
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:46.609 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
um

00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
the town had submitted a road safety
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
audit request due to the safety concerns
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
of the intersection
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
um we did have a a review of that and
 
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:00.950 align:start position:0%
um we did have a a review of that and
um

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
concurred with their concerns and
 
00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
entered a project that is funded through
 
00:59:05.579 --> 00:59:07.069 align:start position:0%
entered a project that is funded through
our

00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
highway safety Improvement program hsip
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
is currently in the 10-year plan as
 
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.410 align:start position:0%
is currently in the 10-year plan as
Conway

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:17.420 align:start position:0%
Conway
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
42522 just for the record and the intent
 
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
of that project uh that's your suspend
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
for a moment well my Clerk's phone is
 
00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:36.190 align:start position:0%
for a moment well my Clerk's phone is
turned

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you uh please continue and the
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
intent of that project was to implement
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
intersection safety improvements
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't it wasn't editor's signal it
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't and it was a roundabout through
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
the public involvement process we had
 
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
multiple public meetings with the select
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
board and with the public we presented
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
both options a signalized intersection
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
and a roundabout intersection
 
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.930 align:start position:0%
and a roundabout intersection
um

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
both work for us
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
um we we put them up equally against
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
each other
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
um and the select board the town
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
officials agreed and supported the
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
roundabout option and the consensus of
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
the public meeting was that the
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
roundabout option was the preferred
 
01:00:25.859 --> 01:00:27.190 align:start position:0%
roundabout option was the preferred
alternative

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.910 align:start position:0%
alternative
yes

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
as you'll hear there were people that
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
had concerns about the roundabout design
 
01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
had concerns about the roundabout design
um

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
every project we do there are people
 
01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:37.970 align:start position:0%
every project we do there are people
that

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
do not 100 agree with with uh everything
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
the public process was that the
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
roundabout was the preferred alternative
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
um the the underlying intent of this
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
bill is to to take that
 
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
that public process
 
01:00:59.890 --> 01:00:59.900 align:start position:0%
um and require us to to put in a signal
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
that sort of goes against our whole
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
public participation process
 
01:01:07.319 --> 01:01:08.030 align:start position:0%
public participation process
um

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
that so A few things that you might have
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
heard I'll try to answer some of the
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
questions that that you've already asked
 
01:01:19.319 --> 01:01:20.569 align:start position:0%
questions that that you've already asked
um

01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
the design of the roundabout there was
 
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
the demonstration the the 83 foot
 
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.109 align:start position:0%
the demonstration the the 83 foot
vehicle

01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
um went through the roundabout not
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
easily but went through the roundabout
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
the the curb it went over is the truck
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
apron on the inside of the roundabout
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
it's intended for the trucks to go on
 
01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
um cars stay off trucks go on it it's a
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's intended for the trucks to be able
 
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
to navigate around the roundabout
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
um one thing to note is the roundabout
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
it went through was smaller than the
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
intended design that we have
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
we reviewed that vehicle where the the
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
design initially was
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
um larger than that roundabout we're
 
01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
actually going to increase it a little
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
more to make sure I'm sorry you're going
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
to increase increase the diameter thank
 
01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
you um to to ensure that that his extra
 
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
large Vehicles can can go through
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh one thing I would know
 
01:02:27.049 --> 01:02:27.059 align:start position:0%
uh the the track the the dump trucks the
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
large vehicles
 
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
um these are all designed to handle
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
those regular sized vehicles
 
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:39.059 align:start position:0%
um case in point we have a roundabout on
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
Route 9 in Swansea daily
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
modular homes travel from Vermont into
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
they navigate through those roundabouts
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
and those those are daily
 
01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.510 align:start position:0%
and those those are daily
um

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
school buses we heard about the the
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
roundabout at the right at the entrance
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
the National North High School
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
um there's there's some near the um uh
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
here in Concord
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
um a fire trucks
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
are the basically the same body length
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
and type as a school bus
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
um there the the roundabout here in
 
01:03:19.619 --> 01:03:20.690 align:start position:0%
um there the the roundabout here in
Concord

01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
um where the ladder truck goes through
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's all designed to handle those
 
01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so the design and the size of
 
01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:29.780 align:start position:0%
the vehicles we can we can design
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
roundabouts so uh to handle those large
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
Vehicles there was a question about the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
safety and again
 
01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:40.370 align:start position:0%
safety and again
um

01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
with the queuing at a traffic signal
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
well let me step back when you when you
 
01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
put in a the existing intersection is a
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
stop intersection so there is control so
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
root 302 is straight through East Conway
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
comes to a stop sign today and that's
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
um changing it to a signal it just takes
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
those problems that you have with a stop
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
sign and rearranges those problems now
 
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
you have people rearranging the back of
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
the queue you have people running the
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
red light
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
the the long-term maintenance you have
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
equipment that you have to maintain when
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
the power goes out signals don't work a
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
roundabout works when the power goes out
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
around about slows traffic I
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
it it is I don't want to repeat what um
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
please said but they're a safer
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
intersection so
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
take any questions you may have thank
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
you yes please represent the loan thank
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
testifying so the question so you
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned about those modular homes so
 
01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
the in Conway it's an 83 foot low boy
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
that was the test for the roundabout so
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
how big are those modular uh
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
tractor trailers that that go through
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
well the wheelbase was it's a little bit
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
more difficult because the wheelbase on
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
a modular home the wheels tend to be in
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
the middle but there there are upwards
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
of 70 75 feet long just the modular
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
component that just the home so you put
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
a trailer on that they're probably
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
equally in length but the wheelbase is
 
01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
different and the width I'm sorry Mr
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up in the in the width
 
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:29.780 align:start position:0%
of the trailer of the modular homes
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
versus the the uh the lowboy that was
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
very usually and is it wider
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
it depends the the gravel they're
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
probably about the same size a modular
 
01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:44.339 align:start position:0%
home is usually around 10 feet 11 feet
 
01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:45.289 align:start position:0%
home is usually around 10 feet 11 feet
wide

01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
wide
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
yes representative chairs thank you chat
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh bill you mentioned
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
you've got a design ready to go you've
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
got a signalized design You've Got a
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
roundabout design and you're going to
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
change your order the roundabout design
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
to increase the diameter
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
are there any land takings that you
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
might be doing for that in either any of
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
the design or is it or is it City
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
currently to city or state land
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
when we went to our last public meeting
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
this summer The preferred alternative
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
was the roundabout so we've continued
 
01:06:25.329 --> 01:06:25.339 align:start position:0%
with the roundabout design
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
we're probably half done with that
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
design have completed the the plan is to
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
advertise that does that project in
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
would require land takings land
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions so one of the advantages
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
with the with a roundabout is
 
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
the problem okay so
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
um it's all within the right-of-way so
 
01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:01.970 align:start position:0%
um it's all within the right-of-way so
um

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
there's uh I know there's property that
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
we'll have to probably acquire easements
 
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.089 align:start position:0%
we'll have to probably acquire easements
for

01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
um from eversource and the town of
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
Conway but for the roundabout that's the
 
01:07:12.359 --> 01:07:13.190 align:start position:0%
Conway but for the roundabout that's the
only

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you any for any further
 
01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.390 align:start position:0%
uh thank you any for any further
questions

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
yes please represent Melvin thank you Mr
 
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
question do you have an idea on what the
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
traffic backup would be if you had a
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:33.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:33.599 --> 01:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
I really have that information
 
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
no we haven't we haven't calculated that
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
yet okay but the requirement would be as
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
we put in turn Lanes so there'd be left
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
turn lane
 
01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.029 align:start position:0%
turn lane
um

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
it depends on how long the signal is
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't I wouldn't imagine the
 
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
backup's going to be very long
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
with a signal and none with a round
 
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.130 align:start position:0%
with a signal and none with a round
please

01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea what's there now
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
for backup
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
so root 302 doesn't back up because they
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
don't have to stop so at East Conway
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
Road I
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
a few cars at the most I would I would
 
01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.589 align:start position:0%
a few cars at the most I would I would
envision

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
envision
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
I have I have presently one two three
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
four more pink cards if anyone else is
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak I'd like to see that
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
card at this time
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to tell those
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we have just about every one of
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
these cards is requesting 15 to 20
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
minutes to speak
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
I would hope during the course of this
 
01:08:45.249 --> 01:08:45.259 align:start position:0%
time maybe some of that information
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
might be repetitive and I would like you
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
to scale back where you can I fully
 
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
understand that this crew came from
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
further north than me and we will afford
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
your time but if if all of these
 
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
individuals require 20 minutes we're
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to recess this
 
01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
hearing and bring it back at the end of
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
the afternoon
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
so let's try and be
 
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.289 align:start position:0%
so let's try and be
uh

01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
effective use of time with like with
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
that I would like to recognize Francis
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman committee
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
members thank you my name is Fran sorrow
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
I live in Center Conway New Hampshire
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I guess one of the things that I'd
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
like to talk about today is a rebuttal
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
on some of the points that have been
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
made earlier some of the folks that are
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
behind me who have yet to speak will add
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
some additional Clarity to that but the
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that I would like to say is
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
that nobody is here to repudiate the
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
work that's been done or the data or the
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
statistics I know Paul and I have talked
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
about these things informally and then
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
at the June selectment meeting
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
everyone accepts the data the concern
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we have is is the proposed
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
roundabout going to be big enough so
 
01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
that the safety attributes associated
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
with roundabouts will actually
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
materialize at this location and the
 
01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:28.340 align:start position:0%
reason we ask that is oil Tanners
 
01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:30.500 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint that was given in May
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
identified some considerations that they
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
had to contend with one is Wetlands on
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
the opposite side of Route 302 and the
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
other is redstone Salvage which is a
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
junkyard and whether there's potential
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
pcbs and other environmental issues in
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
the ground and so our question is
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
specifically in a perfect world if those
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
did not exist
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
would the design of the roundabout
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's being put forth now be bigger if
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes then it should be
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
bigger and if it can't be because of
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
those considerations that is the state's
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
issue not our issue
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a very big concern
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we have nobody's disputing the fact
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
that they're safer okay however a lot of
 
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
that safety I think probably is in areas
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
where most of you may be familiar with
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
more residential areas and passenger
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
traffic the the highway
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
the traffic study that was done if I'm
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
interpreting oil Tanners slides
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
correctly and I would encourage anybody
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
here to dispute it is they showed
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
thirteen thousand five hundred vehicles
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
per day on Route 302 approximately eight
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
percent of those are trucks that's a
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
thousand trucks a day
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
you've heard Mr Deli Angeli speak about
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
the three roundabouts that already exist
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
in Conway they're on the north south
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
road truck traffic isn't allowed in the
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
north south Road the only trucks that go
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
in there are the ones that go to
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
Hannaford's Lowe's Walmart maybe a few
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
others I can tell you from talking to
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
the store managers at each of those
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
locations that in aggregate that's 30 to
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
50 trucks a day not a thousand
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't think they're really
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
irrelevant comp
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
in fact that's pretty obvious that
 
01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:17.900 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:21.179 align:start position:0%
safety when I talked to Mike Dugas at
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
the May meeting May 2022
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
I asked him I said why why do you like
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
the roundabout better he said they're
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
safe I said why you heard the gentleman
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
from the dot say today
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
rear end collisions people run the red
 
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.649 align:start position:0%
rear end collisions people run the red
lights

01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
lights
 
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
every one of us have come to a traffic
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
light before when the light turns green
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
if you just go without verifying that
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
the traffic coming the other way hasn't
 
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
stopped shame on you
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
okay yes people do run red lights but
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know what look at a roundabout go to
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
any roundabout and see how many people
 
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
don't yield to the drivers that are
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
already in the roundabout when that
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
happens and I'm driving my 6 000 pound
 
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
pickup I can stop pretty quick
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
when the two gentlemen behind me here
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
that a driver is a drive in a rig that
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
weighs 140 000 pounds they're not going
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
to stop pretty quick
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
and that's the reality and what you'll
 
01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
hear from one of the drivers is during
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the demo he in fact got cut off and
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley who was not here because
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
this is a house hearing was in his cab
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
and saw it and couldn't believe it so we
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
saw it real real life but I would
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at the video of
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
the demo I shared that with commissioner
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
Cass it's available every one of you
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
should look at it I think it speaks
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
volumes you've heard Mr Deli Angeli say
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
that the trucks get around the
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
roundabout they do is that a definition
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
of success because the truck can get
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
around the roundabout at five miles an
 
01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.270 align:start position:0%
around the roundabout at five miles an
hour

01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
when you've got a thousand trucks that
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
are going to be going through this
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
roundabout a day all I ask is that you
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
look at the video you can see the
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
traffic back up in the video that was in
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
a controlled environment
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
okay and we heard about feedback from
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
the town and the selectment
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen are disinterested parties
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
for one reason
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
none of them live on the east Conway
 
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.649 align:start position:0%
none of them live on the east Conway
Road

01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
Road
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have to deal with the traffic
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
none of them have businesses on the East
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
Conway Road they don't have to deal with
 
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
the issues that you're going to hear
 
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
some of these gentlemen talk about
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
and in Conway with a Conway Daily Sun
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
they do this thing called a teletub
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
where they ask the residents what they
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
think about an issue
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
the respondents from the tele talk on
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
the roundabout versus the traffic signal
 
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
in June I believe of 2021 is 63 of the
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
respondents favored a traffic signal
 
01:14:52.739 --> 01:14:53.890 align:start position:0%
respondents favored a traffic signal
so

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:53.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
isn't that isn't that the town why are
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
five people who are disinterested
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
parties the town
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
I live on the east Conway Road I'm one
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
of those people that have to deal with
 
01:15:04.739 --> 01:15:07.310 align:start position:0%
of those people that have to deal with
it

01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
um let's see what are some of the other
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
things somebody asked the question about
 
01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.870 align:start position:0%
things somebody asked the question about
budget

01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
the design that's been put forth right
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
now for the roundabout is five hundred
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars more expensive than the
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
traffic signal I'm not making the number
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
up it's from Hoyle Tanner's presentation
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
if it's wrong well forgive me but that's
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
what they're saying five hundred
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
um what are some of the other things
 
01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
traffic the Hoyle Tanner presentation
 
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
for a traffic signal in 2022
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
the traffic for AM and PM was they use
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
letter grades b and a b
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
20 years projection forward 2042 be in a
 
01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:49.490 align:start position:0%
20 years projection forward 2042 be in a
b

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
b
 
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:53.900 align:start position:0%
for the roundabout 2022 b and a c
 
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
2042 b and a d the traffic was projected
 
01:15:59.689 --> 01:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
to get worse
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
if that's factually incorrect I would
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
let these gentlemen rebut that but I'm
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
telling you what was in Hoyle Tanner's
 
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.270 align:start position:0%
telling you what was in Hoyle Tanner's
presentation

01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh what are some of the others
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
in terms of the public officials that
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
have spoken to it I talked to Chief
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
Maddie the police chief yesterday
 
01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
I would say it's fair to say that he is
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
in favor of whatever is the safest what
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
he said to me and I I would welcome any
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
of you to reach out to him is that the
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
drivers of the experts they're the ones
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
that know what's going to be safer you
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
will hear from two of the drivers I
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
think it's critically important that you
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
hear from them the fire chief who
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
supported the roundabout has since
 
01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.410 align:start position:0%
supported the roundabout has since
retired

01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
the current fire chief whom I spoke with
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
personally is not a fan of roundabouts
 
01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
and he was going to submit written
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
testimony through the general quote
 
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.490 align:start position:0%
testimony through the general quote
website

01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
whether he does or not
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
you can read it if he does
 
01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
the public meeting
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
that we heard about with a D.O.T
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
solicited public input that's all we
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
read about they want public input public
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
input I attended the May meeting
 
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
one person at that meeting
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
favored the roundabout everybody else
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
favored a traffic signal
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
one person I was there representative
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate you take the time that
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
you need let's move yeah so I think my
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
point is
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
if you can make it big enough every one
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
of these gentlemen drivers business
 
01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:50.810 align:start position:0%
of these gentlemen drivers business
owners

01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
owners
 
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
fire officials police officials have
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
said if it can be big enough
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
it'll work we pointed the D.O.T Mike
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
Dugas at the time to a roundabout in
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
Gorham Maine at Grande aggregates
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
that works these guys drive through it
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
plenty of time it works
 
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
if you cannot make it big enough
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
then put a traffic signal in that's all
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
we're asking because whatever you build
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be there for our lifetime
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
and we have to live with it
 
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for your testimony are
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.199 --> 01:18:28.189 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I held the other room on the
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
is it traffic reasonably equal in both
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
directions no the track this
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
approximately thirteen thousand five
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
hundred Vehicles a day on route through
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
route 302 half of that on the East
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
Conway Road okay so there's two cars for
 
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
every one going through 302. I just I
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
just can't understand why
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
everybody will be satisfied if they put
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
up a spotlight at this intersection for
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
and see what the results are
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
people can make up their own mind I just
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
don't understand that
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
you agree with that we agreed we agree
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
one of the gentlemen asked in about
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
rollovers don't you have a risk of a
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
rollover it may have been here sir when
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
you take the sharp turn they're taking
 
01:19:25.729 --> 01:19:25.739 align:start position:0%
those turns now there's no light but
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
they're taking the turn they're not
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
rolling over what happens when you have
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
a center Mount trailer loaded with logs
 
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's extremely top heavy that's going
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
around a roundabout and someone cuts in
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
front of them then you're going to have
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
a roll open thank you for the new
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
representatives represent photography
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
was would you believe question which we
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
try and refrain from uh with testimony
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%

like to recognize who came into the room
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman members of the

board my name is Steve Woodcock I live
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
on East Conway Road I'm also a
 
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative uh from Conway I'm
 
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
heading back to the education committee
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
shortly and I appreciate you taking me
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
Mark and uh to do for this
 
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.350 align:start position:0%
Mark and uh to do for this
um

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
the process Jeb Bradley and I and Tom
 
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.410 align:start position:0%
the process Jeb Bradley and I and Tom
here

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
two terms ago and talked about getting
 
01:20:46.729 --> 01:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
something in the in the 10-year plan
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
because of the uh increasing amount of
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
accidents and deaths were there and the
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
board did that uh your group did that uh
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
there they went through the process they
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
went through the public hearing um I
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
would agree with with uh Fran that the
 
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
public hearing was uh uh limited support
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh represent uh resident wise in terms
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
of the roundabout uh but I would say in
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
all fairness D.O.T was up front on both
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
the statistics both their plans uh and
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
were right out front with it they
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
weren't lying and at the end of the
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
hearing the the folks who live on East
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
Colony Road pretty much were you know we
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
don't really give a damn what you do
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
just do something
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's the end of the result as things
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
have transpired in the demos I also sat
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
through the demos and wrote in one of
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
the trucks at the second demonstration
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh there's no question on the debt on
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
the roundabouts that they're using in
 
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
town now these vehicles except for
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
Jeff's uh lower right of these vehicles
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh are struggling to get through
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
struggling to get through
 
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh and I and I agree with that um that
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's not going to work I I would you
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
asked about the traffic backup at East
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
County Road oh yeah you can these truck
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
guys can be there
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
seven eight ten minutes I'm heading
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
behind him it's not happy
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
um because they can't get out because
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of cars going back and forth
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
and they were very clear at the hearing
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
that the t-boning and the accidents are
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
a lot more difficult at 40 miles an hour
 
01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
and dangerous than they are at 15 around
 
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
round above
 
01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
all that being said there was no
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
question that the roundabout in my mind
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
that the D.O.T and the engineer came
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
back with were not sufficient no
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
question however since that time I've
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with Paul uh as well as some
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
of the other people and the D in our DOT
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh and uh Paul who's now the uh was a
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
Tom engineer now Italian engineer and
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
assistant time manager has changed the
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
design has increased the design
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's the key Jeff asked that about
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
that before the truck I just want to be
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
safe they won't be able to get through
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
no matter how they go I don't care if
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
they go on a stoplight or a roundabout
 
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be slow and they're
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
pulling all that weight everybody knows
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
that it's gonna be slow uh so I do I
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
just want to bring that to the point dot
 
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
came back and and we're back a year
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
folks this was supposed to be done this
 
01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.189 align:start position:0%
folks this was supposed to be done this
may

01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
we waited three years now so we've done
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
this may we've gone through two boards
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
and they're uh changing the design and
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
the bid time has cost us another year
 
01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh so I do want to to complement a
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
Conley uh the D.O.T and Paul for
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
adjusting their uh plans from what they
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
had hoped to get until what they have
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
now so the the answer to my question is
 
01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
is it big enough they tell us it will be
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
within your design to the truck is uh
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
going to be slow going through that
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh the car's going to slow
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
that absolutely
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't think the town can afford
 
01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
waiting any longer some of you uh use
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
that road know how difficult it is uh
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions uh I
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
came in to the first hearing without an
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
opinion I came into the second public
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
hearing uh without an opinion I live on
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
that road
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
we want something done and we just
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to be safe we wanted to
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
accommodate because as as uh
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
um Thomas when we first started they've
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
changed their first mile mile half two
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
and a half miles in that road right up
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
to the transfer station is commercial
 
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
but from there down for the next four
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
miles is relatively residential except
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
the gazillion driveways there with
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
people in canoes trying to get into the
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
river but the reality is that last half
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
a mile uh from the from the with the
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
last stop down by the police station and
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
the railroad tracks to the corner uh
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
islow is back up is dangerous and it's
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous for these guys trying to get
 
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
their rigs out and it's dangerous for
 
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:33.140 align:start position:0%
the public going by on East County Road
 
01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:37.739 align:start position:0%
I think the town has acquiesced in my
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
opinion to the driver's concerns and
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
they're guaranteed that they'll make a
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
roundabout to fits do the town residents
 
01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
want the surround about no
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
they want the stoplight because that's
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
what they're convinced about but they
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
have not seen the big one and I think we
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
have to have a a agreement here what's
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
going to work for both if you have the
 
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
stoplights clear not gonna be as good as
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
the roundabout for the traffic for the
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
guys so that that's my my thank you
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there
 
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you you're welcome
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
we have uh three more cards
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to remind you that I
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
have six minutes and I don't want to
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
stymie your input but if if we need to
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
run the 15 minutes for each and probably
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
after the first Speaker going to recess
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
out of this hearing so to be heard later
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
in the day
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh with that I would like to hear from
 
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:38.540 align:start position:0%
committee would like to hear from Mr
 
01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:40.370 align:start position:0%
committee would like to hear from Mr
William

01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
William
 
01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:48.530 align:start position:0%
William
doggle

01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
I was uh
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
my name is William Dodd I work for Berks
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
I was one of the drivers
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the roundabouts I haul heavy
 
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.970 align:start position:0%
in the roundabouts I haul heavy
equipment

01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I support this
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
um the biggest concern I have obviously
 
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
with everybody else's safety
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
but I go through that intersection every
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
day of my life
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
I weigh anywhere between 120 and 160 000
 
01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.450 align:start position:0%
I weigh anywhere between 120 and 160 000
pounds

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
the dot brought up the thing about
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes their axles are
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
halfway down that manufactured hole I'm
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
81 feet long and my axles are at the end
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
I cannot take Corners like people think
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
I can whether it's an intersection or a
 
01:26:33.239 --> 01:26:34.669 align:start position:0%
I can whether it's an intersection or a
roundabout

01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
roundabout
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be slow going through it
 
01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:38.870 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be slow going through it
um

01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
our equipment's only getting bigger
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
and like I said I don't care if they put
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
a roundabout
 
01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's just got to be a lot bigger and a
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
lot stronger
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
because of while I'm hauling over it the
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
other three roundabouts we have in town
 
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
I cannot get a permit to go over it the
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
only reason we were on that roundabout
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
is to do this demonstration to make sure
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
we could go over it when both trucks I
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
was in the first one the other truck was
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
behind me went through that we did have
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
a traffic backup
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
so I just want you to realize that
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
this intersection is a unique
 
01:27:16.199 --> 01:27:17.510 align:start position:0%
this intersection is a unique
intersection

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.550 align:start position:0%
intersection
and

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
I I just think you have to take notice
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
of a lot more than what you are
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
and that's thank you thank you William
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone with questions
 
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.229 align:start position:0%
and just
um

01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
for a short myself I'm very familiar
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
with this I'm very familiar with the
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
with your organization and the others
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
that travel through every day thank you
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
Todd welcome to Public Works
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
Todd Bryant
 
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
owner of Todd Bryant's Trucking Heavy
 
01:28:10.490 --> 01:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hauling Company
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
it basically
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
it needs the roundabout is going to be
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
need to be bigger or you know a
 
01:28:18.179 --> 01:28:19.970 align:start position:0%
need to be bigger or you know a
stoplight

01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
stoplight
 
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the wear and tear on our trucks and
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's more than
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
every company on that road has a low bed
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of guys coming out of
 
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
there 120 140 like Bill said
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
every day I bet there's at least two or
 
01:28:34.129 --> 01:28:34.139 align:start position:0%
three loads coming out of there like
 
01:28:34.139 --> 01:28:35.570 align:start position:0%
three loads coming out of there like
that

01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:37.850 align:start position:0%
that
and

01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
basically the wear and tear is I bet
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
double on our equipment and just the
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
damage to the like the truck apron
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
um cars throughout that demonstration
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
you can see the bricks all broke broken
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
out of that round about that was used
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
for the demonstration
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
which um
 
01:28:59.570 --> 01:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
you know that's just one of my concerns
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
and also when you come into a roundabout
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
with a tractor trailer
 
01:29:06.169 --> 01:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
you can't see especially if you're 14
 
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
feet wide if somebody comes in behind
 
01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
you because you have to swing wide to
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
get around these curbs they put in
 
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
if somebody hooks into the back of your
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
trailer you're not going to even feel
 
01:29:16.739 --> 01:29:17.570 align:start position:0%
trailer you're not going to even feel
them

01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to drag them all around the
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
corner or until you do actually see them
 
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.490 align:start position:0%
corner or until you do actually see them
um

01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
but that's basically yep thank you thank
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
you Ms Bryant any questions Mr Bryant
 
01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you chip so I thank you
 
01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
um is I probably should ask this
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
question earlier is the traffic
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
at that present intersection
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
more pronoun is is there more traffic in
 
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
with with the tourism and people the
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
temporary residents as opposed to maybe
 
01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
this time of year as much yes for sure
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
skiing okay yep it's a very busy
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
intersection thank you thank you
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative Juris representative
 
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion would you prefer
 
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
having a traffic signal there or a large
 
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:13.070 align:start position:0%
having a traffic signal there or a large
roundabout

01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
my opinion would be a traffic signal
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%

um we've had the business for 45 years
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
and have been on East Conway Road
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
for probably the last 35
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
that we run into as the other guys do
 
01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
know our trucks are not that long but
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
you've got uh people that are of course
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
impatient at the intersections they're
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
going to be that way whether regardless
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
of what's there
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
um human nature is everybody's go go go
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I just feel that with the
 
01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.590 align:start position:0%
and I just feel that with the
um

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
I'll support whatever goes in I'm happy
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to resolve the
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
problem that is there serious but
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
um with the light at least there is some
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
semblance of order
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
or more so uh yes people are going to
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
run a light
 
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.370 align:start position:0%
run a light
but

01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
you're stopped it's I just feel that's
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's a better a better way to go with
 
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
the light at least give it a try
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
what's 30 more days UH 60 more days
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's how I feel thank you thank you
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
for your testimony any questions
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you one and all thank you uh
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
before I close the hearing I would just
 
01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
make a request to the department uh
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
Schoenberg can you provide us with the
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
documentation here
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
um one being the roundabout that the
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
test was run on one which was your
 
01:32:46.129 --> 01:32:46.139 align:start position:0%
initial design for this roundabout your
 
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
updated and what a signalized
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
intersection would look like if you
 
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
could provide that for us in the next
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
few days I think that would be very
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
helpful for uh for the committee
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
with that I will close uh house bill
 
01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:14.990 align:start position:0%
with that I will close uh house bill
480.

01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
I want to call this Committee hearing to
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
order on House Bill 456 and I will call
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
upon the prime sponsor representative
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
and good morning to all the members
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
the record I'm rep representative
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
Michael those I represent Rockingham
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
District Five one of two representatives
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
from District Five
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
the other is Committee Member
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative mark vallone
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
we represent together the town of Epping
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm here this morning to introduce
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 4 5 6.
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that takes a small step forward
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the direction of solving a problem
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
that I know this committee has been
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
grappling with for a year or better
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
and that is the problem of how to
 
01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone pays their fair
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
share to maintain roads and bridges
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
I have prepared a brief written
 
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
testimony which I have distributed and
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
is circulating around the table
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing that representative
 
01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:20.060 align:start position:0%
you're welcome just to help you remember
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
after this hearing is is
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
in your memory banks and you can't quite
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
remember what it's about it's a one
 
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.729 --> 01:36:39.739 align:start position:0%
so what does this bill do this bill
 
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
authorizes the collection
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
of the equivalent of the of a gallon of
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
gas tax on
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
the amount of electricity that would be
 
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
equivalent to that gallon of gas
 
01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:56.570 align:start position:0%
equivalent to that gallon of gas
so

01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
right now we all pay somewhere between
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
18 and 20 cents
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
when we buy a gallon of gas
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would authorize the collection
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
of that 18 to 20 cents for an amount of
 
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
electricity to charge an electric
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's equivalent to a gallon of
 
01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:16.189 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's equivalent to a gallon of
gas

01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
gas
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
so for every 34 kilowatt hours of
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
electricity dispensed through a
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
separately metered
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging station
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
the utility could would be authorized to
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
collect that 18 to 20 cents
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
for every 34 kilowatt hours
 
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
now a typical electric car battery only
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
holds about 51 kilowatt hours so the
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
amount of tax we're talking about on
 
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charge is only about 30
 
01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:52.790 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charge is only about 30
cents

01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
so this is simply a opportunity
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
to allow our electric vehicle owning
 
01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.750 align:start position:0%
to allow our electric vehicle owning
citizens

01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
to do what I'm sure they all want to do
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
which is contribute funds to the
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the roads and bridges
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's all the bill does
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
and it's a a fairly simple and
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
straightforward process
 
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
I know that it's probably not the
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
ultimate solution to this problem
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
the number of electric vehicles on the
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
roads in New Hampshire today for example
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
is only about 6 000 cars so it's not
 
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
going to generate a lot of Revenue
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
and in fact it may not even generate
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
enough Revenue to make make the whole
 
01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:45.179 align:start position:0%
process worthwhile but I wanted to give
 
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
you here in this committee the
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
opportunity to evaluate whether this is
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
something worth doing or not and that's
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
why I have proposed this bill
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh I won't go into much more detail than
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
that but I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
thank you representative votes any
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative Jack please
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I thank the
 
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
illustrious chair of the sde committee
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh it isn't clear from the bill who is
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to actually uh pay the tax
 
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
I did look at 236 colon 132 it does
 
01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:19.810 align:start position:0%
I did look at 236 colon 132 it does
Define

01:39:19.810 --> 01:39:19.820 align:start position:0%
Define
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh what a what a electronic vehicle
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
charging station is but it isn't totally
 
01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
clear to me from the bill who's going to
 
01:39:31.850 --> 01:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
that is probably a weakness of this bill
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
my intention was that the utilities
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
would would collect since they uh
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
distribute and monitor and uh meter the
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
electricity they would collect the tax
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
or apply the tax to the amount of the
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
elector the price of the electricity
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
that was dispensed through the meter
 
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
but I did not uh when OLS drafted this
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill they did not uh
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
make that clear in in the bill drafting
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue that the committee
 
01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
would have to address if you wanted to
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
do you representative representative
 
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
Jack other questions representative
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
votes please okay uh representative
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
Newton please
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh for taking my question
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
how would this work at an individual's
 
01:40:30.169 --> 01:40:30.179 align:start position:0%
house if an individual was charging
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
their vehicle with just a 20 amp service
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
how would you charge
 
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
what you would need to charge for
 
01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
charging the car
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's a good question and the answer is
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a separate meter
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
on that charging station in order for
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
this tax to be applied to that
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
particular EV charge
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
since most homes don't have a separate
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
meter on their electric vehicle charging
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
station they would not be this this tax
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
would not be applicable to them
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
some utilities such as New Hampshire
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op I believe utility Unitil
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
as well do allow separate meters on your
 
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging station so
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
that if you wanted for example to keep
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
track of how much you're spending on
 
01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
charging your car you could do so and in
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
that case if there's a meter there that
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
could track that electricity then the
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
attacks can be applied but if there's no
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
meter then no tax can no tax can be
 
01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:41.830 align:start position:0%
meter then no tax can no tax can be
applied

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.129 --> 01:41:45.139 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you representative
 
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
so we could just from the previous
 
01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:49.070 align:start position:0%
so we could just from the previous
answer

01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
one way to do this at home was to to
 
01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
possibly compel homeowners to install
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
the media
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and that you kind of explained that
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
in paragraph five of your
 
01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.689 align:start position:0%
in paragraph five of your
of

01:42:02.689 --> 01:42:02.699 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
your sheet here which is a which is
 
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
helpful and then the public stations the
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
next paragraph the utility would collect
 
01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
the tax in aggregate
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
is that is that the intention in both
 
01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
cases if there was a a meter a separate
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
meter applied to an EV charging station
 
01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
at your home the tax could still be
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
applied there it doesn't have to be
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
public it can be a private meter
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
in fact many of the meters that you'll
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
see in various places around the state
 
01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
are not public they're private like
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
charging stations at uh at uh Wentworth
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
Douglas hospital where my wife works I
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
happen to know
 
01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
um that those are for the use of
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
employees only so it's it's a it's a pub
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
it's a semi-public I guess you would say
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
charging station but not entirely public
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
but as long as it's metered it could be
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
app that the tax could be applicable
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's public or private or
 
01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:10.090 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's public or private or
semi-public

01:43:10.090 --> 01:43:10.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
just briefly follow up so the parking
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
garage down the street here on Green
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
Street or it went with Douglas we could
 
01:43:19.729 --> 01:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
install meters and then the utility
 
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for collecting that
 
01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:22.910 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for collecting that
tax

01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.770 align:start position:0%
tax
theoretically

01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
the utility would always be responsible
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
for collecting the tax and remanding it
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
any of the case okay thank you yes thank
 
01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:34.490 align:start position:0%
any of the case okay thank you yes thank
you

01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%

okay I now call upon representative Mark
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
McConkey who's another one of the
 
01:44:06.729 --> 01:44:06.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman illustrious
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
members of the great Public Works and
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
highways committee
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh I had started down the road of a
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
separate piece of legislation uh to
 
01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:23.300 align:start position:0%
address a short-term
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
way to capture some of the revenue that
 
01:44:29.149 --> 01:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
we're not receiving at this point in
 
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
time for the newer members electric cars
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
aren't paying the road toll and in a
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
meeting with representative I mean how
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
how could I continue on without letting
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology go there so that
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
that is why this is here
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
um we I we were coming
 
01:44:49.739 --> 01:44:50.570 align:start position:0%
um we I we were coming
um

01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
I was chairman of the commission that
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
you folks all were kind enough to
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
continue for next year and we'll go back
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
in Earnest on on what we're going to do
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
to uh to get fees for road toll for
 
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
these alternative uh forms of
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh electric and hybrid
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth and there were members in
 
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
that committee thought that we shouldn't
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
wait until that commission is done and
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
that we should get something in now that
 
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
would start the process it may not be
 
01:45:27.609 --> 01:45:27.619 align:start position:0%
the end-all but we are hoping
 
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
that you would give this due
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
consideration and
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here in support of of this
 
01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:37.250 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here in support of of this
proposal

01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McConkey
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative McConkey
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
from the committee please
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
any questions uh yes representative
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
Faulkner please thank you for taking the
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
question I I'm still troubled by the
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
concept of separately meeting if it's a
 
01:45:52.619 --> 01:45:54.709 align:start position:0%
concept of separately meeting if it's a
commercial

01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
station out on the highway obviously
 
01:45:59.149 --> 01:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be separate from any
 
01:45:59.159 --> 01:46:00.050 align:start position:0%
they're going to be separate from any
other

01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:46:03.850 --> 01:46:03.860 align:start position:0%
user but you know employer provided or a
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
landlord provided or individually
 
01:46:08.689 --> 01:46:08.699 align:start position:0%
provided why would anybody ever put a
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
separate meter and in which case aren't
 
01:46:13.129 --> 01:46:13.139 align:start position:0%
we missing
 
01:46:16.729 --> 01:46:16.739 align:start position:0%
a huge part of the of the target uh
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
base to pay this pay this tax
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:46:21.239 --> 01:46:22.550 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.570 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
we are we this is not an end-all and we
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
are missing
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
um uh revenue and other collection
 
01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
points I I believe that um
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
I believe that that this is a start to
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
that process one of the biggest issues
 
01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:48.260 align:start position:0%
to date when we have tried to
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
capture Revenue Source from electric
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
vehicles more so than hybrid is that the
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
automobile dealers and the people that
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
purchase their cars have always been
 
01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
very resistant in what we can do I think
 
01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
this is one of I believe there's a
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill also that I'm on
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
um so I I think in the the end I think
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
the committee will probably have to look
 
01:47:19.729 --> 01:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
at several bills and decide which is the
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Faulkner
 
01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%

01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're a 51c3 non-profit
 
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
and also we are the conveners of a
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group called Drive Electric
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which consists of many
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
state agencies as well as electric
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
vehicle charging infrastructure
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
installers and developers
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
um and I I think I want to start my
 
01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:03.260 align:start position:0%
testimony by saying that uh for years
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
our organization and our supporters
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
would have opposed any suggestion that
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
Electric Vehicle drivers need to be
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
contributing to into the highway fund
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
and and I think that I have come to the
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
conclusion that that position does in
 
01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
fact need to change and needs to change
 
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later and the
 
01:49:22.850 --> 01:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
anecdote that I've been sharing to sort
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
of illustrate that point is that last
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
year during the Super Bowl there were
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
five ads for electric vehicles so these
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles really are ready for the
 
01:49:32.209 --> 01:49:32.219 align:start position:0%
mainstream and we should be planning for
 
01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
how we're going to integrate them into
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
into our grid into our economy and how
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to figure out how we're
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
going to pay for roads and bridges once
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
that becomes the norm I do however have
 
01:49:45.490 --> 01:49:45.500 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
you should have in your inboxes
 
01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:50.219 align:start position:0%
testimony from from some charging
 
01:49:52.729 --> 01:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
providers who will tell you that as it
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
stands there is an enormous amount of
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
capital that is looking for places to
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
invest in electric vehicle charging but
 
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in particular and in
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
many rural places there is not a
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
business case as it stands the trouble
 
01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
is that there just aren't enough cars on
 
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
the road yet and so it's it's a money
 
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
losing Endeavor to invest particularly
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
in fast charging which means that if
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
several members of the committee have
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
noted these separately metered language
 
01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:22.139 align:start position:0%
in this bill which which is going to
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
capture a very small portion of the
 
01:50:26.090 --> 01:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
charging that's happening 80 percent of
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
charging happens at home most of that
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
charging is not on separate meters so
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is public
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
charging we're talking about mostly fast
 
01:50:37.729 --> 01:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
charging and we're talking about a a
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
business a business case that currently
 
01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
is nascents uh and is and is uh and
 
01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
currently not viable in most parts of of
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because of the low levels
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
of penetration so the the trouble here
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that if we're adding additional fees
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
and taxes onto a business that is
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
currently not viable what we're going to
 
01:50:57.890 --> 01:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
see is that there won't be private
 
01:50:59.810 --> 01:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
investment in electric vehicle charging
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the state of New
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which has a real potential to
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
hamper uh our efforts to continue to
 
01:51:08.689 --> 01:51:08.699 align:start position:0%
have a viable tourist industry in the
 
01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
um by 2030 it's forecast they're going
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
to be 3 million EVS on the road between
 
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
Southern Southern New England and Quebec
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
and both Maine and Vermont have robust
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
programs to invest in public charging
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
and we are far behind both of those
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
States so the question that you have to
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
ask yourselves is where will those
 
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
tourists go uh if there's no charges in
 
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so uh I think
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
that personally that their will in the
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
future ba role for some sort of fee like
 
01:51:38.930 --> 01:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
the one that we're discussing for this
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
bill once there are enough vehicles on
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
the road that there is a business model
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
for public charging and the Chargers get
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
built and then they have a and then and
 
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
then we can talk about how those those
 
01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
tourists visiting New Hampshire can
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
contribute to the highway fund I just
 
01:51:54.590 --> 01:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
think the time for that is not is not
 
01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.430 align:start position:0%
think the time for that is not is not
now

01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I in the testimony that I just
 
01:51:58.729 --> 01:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
emailed to the committee uh slightly
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
late because I spent about a half hour
 
01:52:01.250 --> 01:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
wrestling with a printer this morning so
 
01:52:02.689 --> 01:52:02.699 align:start position:0%
I apologize that you don't have written
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of you but I did
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
email it to the committee as I was
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
sitting in the back there are two bills
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
advancing including one that is uh is
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
prime sponsored by the chair that I
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
think are more reasonable approaches to
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
trying to solve this issue in the short
 
01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:15.770 align:start position:0%
trying to solve this issue in the short
term

01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and then I think the question of how
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
to how to ensure that tourists visiting
 
01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
the state are contributing to the
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
highway fund is one that can be figured
 
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
out in the sort of the medium term over
 
01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
you know between 2020 2025 and 2030. so
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my remarks take
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Mr Evans Brown
 
01:52:34.850 --> 01:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
questions of Mr Evans Brown from the
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
committee yes go ahead please
 
01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:39.229 align:start position:0%
committee yes go ahead please
representative

01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
um the question
 
01:52:43.619 --> 01:52:44.330 align:start position:0%
um the question
um

01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
how do we Finance the installation of
 
01:52:51.970 --> 01:52:51.980 align:start position:0%
all these charges and stuff uh do we
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
charge the current taxpayers the current
 
01:52:59.450 --> 01:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
Highway fund do we uh because if we
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
don't have a way of charging the
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle the EV person they're
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
getting a free ride on a system that
 
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
everybody else is paying for so now
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
we're subsidizing them
 
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
to buy something that everybody else has
 
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
to pay for them to use is that what I'm
 
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
hearing are you asking how with regard
 
01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:24.659 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund or with regard to
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging infrastructure
 
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
in general all of it because it all
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
comes down to the same thing someone's
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
got to pay for it and who do you
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
envision see and pay for
 
01:53:39.719 --> 01:53:40.330 align:start position:0%
envision see and pay for
it

01:53:40.330 --> 01:53:40.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
there's a a it's a question I think
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
really calls out for a nuanced and
 
01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
comprehensive solution
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
um that that will probably involve a
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
number of different approaches
 
01:53:54.970 --> 01:53:54.980 align:start position:0%
personally I think that most EV drivers
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
should be should be paying in at the
 
01:53:59.930 --> 01:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
time of registration of their vehicle in
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
in into a fund that goes into the into
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
the highway fund that does that does cry
 
01:54:07.729 --> 01:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
out though what what is it how are
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
tourists then paying for the wear and
 
01:54:10.729 --> 01:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
tear that they cause on their roads
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
which I think then does Point towards
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
having some sort of fee that is added
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
onto public charging the trouble is a
 
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg one which is that we
 
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
need the infrastructure to ensure that
 
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
the tourists keep coming to New
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh and if a fee is going
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
to result in us not building the
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
infrastructure then the tourists aren't
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to come to New Hampshire
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and and so I think that's that's the
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's the question that that I think we
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
need to solve and and I would argue it
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
argues for a phased approach in which we
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
we phase in these type types of these
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
types of fees as used as the user base
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
grows and as the as the business model
 
01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
becomes becomes one that can be
 
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
stabilized and is a little more certain
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the interim in the beginning I I
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
personally believe this is a problem
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
that really calls out for one-time
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
funding as a as a stopgap measure and
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
there are some pots of money that are
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
that are already allocated to that so
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
the the diesel gate fund um is going to
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
to build some fast charging
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
um in in rural places in New Hampshire
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
and that's I think uh five million
 
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
dollars total and Des is here so I they
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
can speak they can speak to that but
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
also the nevi fund which is the national
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle infrastructure program
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
that was part of the bipartisan
 
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law that is 17 million
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
dollars over five years that will also
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
pay for fast charging but I will State
 
01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:34.100 align:start position:0%
uh both of those those programs
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
may still struggle to attract private
 
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
investment because of the rate structure
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we have here in New Hampshire which
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I uh I won't board the
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
committee talking about utility rate
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
structures but if you have not heard
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
about the the troubles that demand
 
01:55:55.729 --> 01:55:55.739 align:start position:0%
charges uh uh um represent for for
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle fast charging it's a
 
01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
major impediment to attracting private
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
investment and it's something that that
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission is is
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
currently in the midst of wrestling with
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:08.699 --> 01:56:10.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.649 --> 01:56:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
on representative Timothy Horrigan in
 
01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
I am representative Timothy Horrigan I'm
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
from Stratford County District 10 which
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
is the town of Durham and um
 
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not an EV user myself I drove here
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
in a stinky old gas guzzling Volvo
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
station wagon a
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicle enthusiasm was
 
01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
trying to refer to those as ice
 
01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:55.850 align:start position:0%
trying to refer to those as ice
um

01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:59.330 --> 01:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
ice internal combustion engine so um
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
and uh but I do think EVS are the wave
 
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
of the future and there is indeed a
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
chicken to the egg problem that uh we
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
need to build out a network of public
 
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
public charging uh charging stations
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
both and that'll probably have to be in
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
the government funded at first or
 
01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
subsidized um the the free market can't
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
do its magic if the infrastructure for
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
the market doesn't exist and um
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a lot to offer to
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
tourists from other states but they
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
can't get to our interstates on they
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
can't get to our wonderful liquor stores
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
on the interstate of
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
if they if they're afraid they won't be
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
able to get home because they can't find
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere to charge their car you know
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
they're not going to stay in our ski
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
resorts even with the rooms and meals
 
01:57:46.129 --> 01:57:46.139 align:start position:0%
taxed lowered from nine to 8.5 or
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
whoever we did to it you know they're
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
not going to do our tax-free shopping or
 
01:57:52.129 --> 01:57:52.139 align:start position:0%
anything or if cheaper cigarettes or any
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
of buyers cheaper cigarettes or any any
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
of that if they don't think they can get
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
home and I think there's a lot of range
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
anxiety for electric vehicle owners um
 
01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:02.689 align:start position:0%
anxiety for electric vehicle owners um
and

01:58:02.689 --> 01:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:05.689 --> 01:58:05.699 align:start position:0%
so I think certainly uh this tax would
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
be be um imposed on public charging
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
stations and although there really isn't
 
01:58:13.850 --> 01:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
I don't know if a good way to do it it
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh does that with where richer people
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
who can afford their own fast charging
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh would not be taxed and uh I mean I
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
guess that does
 
01:58:25.490 --> 01:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
um divert funds from the middle class
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know to the rich people those job
 
01:58:29.689 --> 01:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
creators who are always eager to lure
 
01:58:31.850 --> 01:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
away from other states but still that's
 
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
um a perverse incentive in my opinion
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
and finally I want to point out that
 
01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
even though
 
01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
and not to get two pointers in here and
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
of course this is your bill and this
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee is always running very
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan fashion but all the sponsors
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
of this bill they're all Republicans
 
01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.179 align:start position:0%
mostly some of the mostly very
 
01:58:50.209 --> 01:58:50.219 align:start position:0%
conservative Republicans so I find it a
 
01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
little bit surprising that they're
 
01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:52.669 align:start position:0%
little bit surprising that they're
contemplating

01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
contemplating
 
01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
imposing a new tax so this is a um
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
this is a news tax and even as you know
 
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
a more liberal more Progressive Democrat
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the house um I think I don't think we
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
should be imposing new taxes unless
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
they're structured right and they you
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
know in a progressive way with useful
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
incentives and this one this is a
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
regressive tax the incentives are all
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
wrong and so this is
 
01:59:19.729 --> 01:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
um not the time not the time to impose
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
this tax especially not just on the
 
01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
public charging stations which we're
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
having you know we need to build out a
 
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
network of those and uh we're having a
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
lot of trouble uh
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
doing that so I
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
so I would uh I would say I was
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully your state committee uh not
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this bill this year
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
although at some point we'll have to
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
find a way of
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
making EVS contribute to the road toll
 
01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
and that will involve a new tax but I
 
01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the right new tax to
 
01:59:46.490 --> 01:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I have to say I'd be
 
01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions should
 
01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:52.860 align:start position:0%
anyone have any thank you representative
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
Horrigan any questions of Representative
 
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
Horrigan from the committee uh yes
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Juris please thank you
 
01:59:59.810 --> 01:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
Vice chair thank you representative
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
Horrigan thanks for uh stopping in today
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
the testimony maybe I should ask earlier
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
to Sam Evans is this
 
02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:08.209 align:start position:0%
to Sam Evans is this
state

02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
has property
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
to locate
 
02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
charging stations I mentioned rest stops
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
by ways off of us you know a state road
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
up north we were just talking about
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
route 302 do we know of any
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
incentivization that I'm assuming that
 
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
we would charge
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
we would make could possibly make a deal
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
with investors to come in and maybe for
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
a rental rate that's a little more cost
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
effective uh to maybe start a program
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
like that to incentivize these investors
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
that come in has any been any thought on
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
that and then if if we had the tax we
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
could if we had to do it if we had to
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
demand charge on the meter we could
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
install that at the same time
 
02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that's still a
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
disincentive having this taxed on top of
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
top of everything certainly um I mean
 
02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
I mean there are not just rest stops but
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
lots of public facilities where uh EV
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
stations could be installed for the
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
public and also of course State vehicles
 
02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
are moving to the public so we have
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to have EV like I'm sure
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
we'll soon we probably already have them
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
but we'll soon have EV stations like
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
like over in Hazen Drive there's
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
currently a natural gas filling station
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sure pretty soon
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
that dot will put in a EV station in
 
02:01:31.490 --> 02:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
places like that so there's and you can
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
also do public private Partnerships as I
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
suppose you're thinking other states
 
02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
have lots of them at shopping centers
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
and so forth and actually even the Tesla
 
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a big Elon Musk fan but he
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
he's uh
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
he's kind of subsidized his Chargers and
 
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
although they're only good for people
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
who drive his random automobiles most of
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
those are sort of located on land that
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
he's leasing from public uh
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
from public property owners like uh but
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'm not I'm not the expert on
 
02:02:03.169 --> 02:02:03.179 align:start position:0%
it but that's something that's something
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
you can consider but I'm not sure if
 
02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
this bill will really
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is not really a
 
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
good vehicle for moving forward with it
 
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
certainly sure in the future it will be
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
like uh and of course soon it'll be like
 
02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
gasoline where the you know they have
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
filling pumps and from every convenience
 
02:02:21.169 --> 02:02:21.179 align:start position:0%
store and part of that
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
part of that is so like they know a
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of people come in and
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
buy like a Coke or a hot dog or whatever
 
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
so that I'm sure eventually once the
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
technology becomes more ubiquitous so
 
02:02:34.129 --> 02:02:34.139 align:start position:0%
that'll be they'll have those EV
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
stations and all those convenience
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
stores too but that's
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's something that's not going to
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
happen spontaneously or right away but
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
anyways I don't know this bill is useful
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
for that effort but you can consider it
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
thanks it's
 
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
got it thank you representative thank
 
02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Juris
 
02:02:51.169 --> 02:02:51.179 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan further
 
02:02:52.609 --> 02:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative Horrigan
 
02:02:55.010 --> 02:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh yes uh please uh
 
02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry represented I bear with me
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
boys thank you thank you you're welcome
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman I appreciate
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
it and representative hurricane thank
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.639 --> 02:03:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:03:09.649 --> 02:03:09.659 align:start position:0%
if you testify that you object to the
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
the partisan Nation nature of the bill
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
accepting that but also taking
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
government subsidies out of the equation
 
02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
what would be a solution that you would
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
propose for this committee's
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
consideration that would begin to
 
02:03:27.490 --> 02:03:27.500 align:start position:0%
address the problem that would equitably
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
manage all the vehicles that are using
 
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
the roads in our state thank you well
 
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not on TV it's just hitting this
 
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
bill and that a lot of those are issued
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
for ways and beans or some other
 
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
committee well I guess it's I guess it's
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
been the ear purview I mean I think
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think eventually we'll probably have
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
to move to charging people per mile and
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
I know that's a new fee and people won't
 
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
like that but have that registry maybe
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
registration time you have to State your
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
mileage and I mean there's a lot of
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
problems with that like verifying that
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
your mileage is correct and so forth but
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I'm not wedded to any principle
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
and also like
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
as like eventually if EVS dominate the
 
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
landscape the whole Marketplace we could
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
probably just calculate what percentage
 
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
of uh electricity is being used for the
 
02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
vehicles and then
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
have the electric you know take that out
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
of the electric bills that again is a
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
of course that's another new tax and
 
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
electricity is too expensive anyway but
 
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
um those are those are just the ideas
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but it's pretty
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
much up
 
02:04:30.290 --> 02:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
probably up to you guys more than me to
 
02:04:32.209 --> 02:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
like sort that out and I'm not sure if
 
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
you're able to sort that out uh you know
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of weeks but thanks
 
02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your candidate thank you
 
02:04:39.169 --> 02:04:39.179 align:start position:0%
Mr fisherman
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you represent bully representative
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
Horrigan further questions of
 
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
Representative Corrigan from the
 
02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:43.970 align:start position:0%
Representative Corrigan from the
committee

02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you for your
 
02:04:46.139 --> 02:04:49.490 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you for your
testimony

02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
okay I will now call upon and you did
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
not indicate a position of the bill Mr
 
02:04:57.410 --> 02:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
Michael Fitzgerald I assume it's from
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services you have no
 
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
position but you want to testify to us
 
02:05:04.669 --> 02:05:04.679 align:start position:0%
for three minutes welcome to Public
 
02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
Works and highways yes good morning Mr
 
02:05:08.570 --> 02:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
chair my name is Michael Fitzgerald I'm
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
the assistant director of the uh air
 
02:05:12.649 --> 02:05:12.659 align:start position:0%
Resources Division at the Department of
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services our division is
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
charged with uh uh Environmental Policy
 
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh that includes
 
02:05:23.290 --> 02:05:23.300 align:start position:0%
administration of the Volkswagen funds
 
02:05:26.689 --> 02:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh that were previously mentioned for
 
02:05:29.450 --> 02:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
providing for charging and for uh
 
02:05:32.689 --> 02:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
General promotion of electric vehicles
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
um in terms of their uh positive
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and so I'd just
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
like to make a couple of very quick
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
points as you noted we do not take a
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
several of the points that I was going
 
02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
to raise have been raised already by
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
members I the members of the committee
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
or those testifying before me we have
 
02:05:56.649 --> 02:05:56.659 align:start position:0%
long taken a position that
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles should pay a fair
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
portion of the road toll and that they
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
should there should be an equitable way
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
to uh to determine that and I think
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
directionally this bill
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
um uh heads in that direction
 
02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
appropriately by by looking at charging
 
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
they're just a couple of issues that I'd
 
02:06:20.770 --> 02:06:20.780 align:start position:0%
like to highlight
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
one as was noted most charging occurs at
 
02:06:25.609 --> 02:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
home and it's not separately separately
 
02:06:25.619 --> 02:06:26.709 align:start position:0%
home and it's not separately separately
metered

02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
metered
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
second even public charging a lot of it
 
02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
is not separately metered a lot of it is
 
02:06:37.129 --> 02:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
at commercial buildings shopping centers
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's some on State uh you know at
 
02:06:42.589 --> 02:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
at rest areas
 
02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
um et cetera you'll you'll note down in
 
02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.350 align:start position:0%
um et cetera you'll you'll note down in
Hooksett

02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hooksett
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
um but uh there are some restraints on
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
on the use of State uh some State
 
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
Properties but
 
02:06:55.729 --> 02:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
um those by uh by and large many of
 
02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
those are not separately metered and it
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
would be a significant expense to put in
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
a a separate meter as was noted some
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
utilities do encourage separate meters
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
for EVS the intent of that is to take
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
advantage of time of use rates so that
 
02:07:15.250 --> 02:07:15.260 align:start position:0%
you can charge your car at a lower rate
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
come in and charge it at night when when
 
02:07:20.209 --> 02:07:20.219 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity may be lower and
 
02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
utilities can offer a special rate
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
this might sort of offset that but I do
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
think that there is a solution that is
 
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
necessary this is a complex and thorny
 
02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
problem as has been noted there's been
 
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
several commissions over the past few
 
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
years and this committee has wrestled
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
with this issue we do think that a
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
solution is necessary and that the EVS
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
should pay their fair share
 
02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and that that it if to be Equitable
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
it should be you know perhaps mileage
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
based or or as I say this bill seems to
 
02:07:57.649 --> 02:07:57.659 align:start position:0%
directionally go the right way in terms
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
of converting the electricity use into
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
into uh motor vehicle usage
 
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know equivalent gallon of gas
 
02:08:10.609 --> 02:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:08:13.070 --> 02:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
um the uh we also agree that it's
 
02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
important to capture uh road toll from
 
02:08:18.169 --> 02:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
vehicles coming into the state
 
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
um and that that
 
02:08:23.089 --> 02:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
um again directionally this bill would
 
02:08:25.490 --> 02:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
would do that I would note that uh as
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey uh noted that
 
02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
the bill there is a bill in the Senate
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
um that would introduce a 50 surcharge
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
on electric vehicles and I believe that
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill was amended actually to uh to a
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and it passed out of committee last
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
week this this week actually so that'll
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
probably be coming this way as well I
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
think there are several several
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
potential Vehicles we're happy to
 
02:08:52.089 --> 02:08:52.099 align:start position:0%
provide uh
 
02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
provide input and um
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
I think that that pretty much covers the
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
um the territory that I wanted to
 
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
to address I'd be happy to try to take
 
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
any questions on our efforts relative to
 
02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
public charging infrastructure and so on
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
if the committee has any desire
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Fitzgerald any questions of
 
02:09:16.970 --> 02:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Fitzgerald from the committee
 
02:09:18.890 --> 02:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd police
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman and Mr Cheryl
 
02:09:22.490 --> 02:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and I'm
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
going to apologize up to you in advance
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're going to be able
 
02:09:26.689 --> 02:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
to answer this question but it just kind
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
of struck me having read the bill but
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
the language includes output of
 
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
electricity it takes to equal the energy
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
content of one gallon do you happen to
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
know what what numerically that output
 
02:09:42.169 --> 02:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
of energy is that would equal I don't uh
 
02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
happen to know that off the top of my
 
02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
head but it is you know I mean there is
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
a measure of you know
 
02:09:50.570 --> 02:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
100 000 BTUs per gallon or something
 
02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
like that and and so there can be a
 
02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
direct equivalence
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
um you have you do have to account for
 
02:09:58.010 --> 02:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
the efficiency of an electric engine and
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
and those sort of things
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
um uh but I believe what the build tasks
 
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
it tests the department of safety
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
um to to you know determine that
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
calculation and and we'd certainly be
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
more than willing to uh and ready to
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
assist them to do that I appreciate that
 
02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Vice chairman
 
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Boyd further
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
questions of Mr Fitzgerald from the
 
02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:23.689 align:start position:0%
questions of Mr Fitzgerald from the
committee

02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions okay thank you Mr
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay I will now call upon uh Miss
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Hall from the uh New Hampshire
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
Department of safety's road toll Bureau
 
02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
please and I notice again you have
 
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
indicated no position on the bill but uh
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
we welcome you coming in and speaking to
 
02:10:49.609 --> 02:10:49.619 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:10:52.729 --> 02:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
um we are neutral we
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
agree that you know the majority of the
 
02:10:59.689 --> 02:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
consumption from Electric Vehicle users
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
is from their home charging
 
02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:03.470 align:start position:0%
is from their home charging
um

02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
the gallon equivalency that was just
 
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
being discussed would have to be
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
determined by our department so
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
taking that into consideration and the
 
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
need to develop changes to our current
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
forms and our current software we would
 
02:11:20.689 --> 02:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
need at least a six month lead time in
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
order to implement this bill so request
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
that we push the effective date out
 
02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:28.189 align:start position:0%
that we push the effective date out
accordingly

02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
02:11:28.199 --> 02:11:29.089 align:start position:0%
accordingly
um

02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
and additionally the current language in
 
02:11:36.729 --> 02:11:36.739 align:start position:0%
259 3D that defines alternative fuel
 
02:11:40.609 --> 02:11:40.619 align:start position:0%
explicitly excludes electricity from the
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
definition of an alternative fuel so we
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
would need to amend that RSA as well to
 
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay is that your testimony all right
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Jack
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
please yeah thank you Mr chairman uh can
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
you suggest what a an effective date
 
02:11:59.410 --> 02:11:59.420 align:start position:0%
that you would be comfortable with
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're that we did an
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
amendment uh January 1st of 24 would be
 
02:12:07.609 --> 02:12:07.619 align:start position:0%
ideal that's assuming you know that this
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't be passed until later on
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
this year and we would need a six-month
 
02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:15.050 align:start position:0%
this year and we would need a six-month
lead

02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.530 --> 02:12:17.540 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh further questions
 
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay go ahead please uh
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bogart uh just a real
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
quick what was that RSA that needed to
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
get updated because of the definitions
 
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:41.209 --> 02:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bogart for the
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
question yes I'm Jairus please thank you
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair Jennifer you're at the
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
D.O.T and you're in the business of
 
02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
collecting road tolls as it is right now
 
02:12:52.609 --> 02:12:52.619 align:start position:0%
with fossil fuel cars correct yeah I'm
 
02:12:54.169 --> 02:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
at Department of Safety Department of
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
Safety uh
 
02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.589 align:start position:0%
Safety uh
okay

02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
has there been any discussion on how to
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
do this in your department by getting
 
02:13:05.569 --> 02:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
more EV Chargers out there and me
 
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
possibly metering them so we can collect
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
more road toll as everyone's aware it's
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
a Hot Topic across the country and we
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
attend several conferences
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're working with the
 
02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
fuel Tax Administration and the
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
international fuel Tax Administration
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
to try to you know figure out the best
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
way to handle this a lot of discussion
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
about charging a mileage-based user fee
 
02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:31.970 align:start position:0%
about charging a mileage-based user fee
um

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have a suggestion for the best
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
solution at this point
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Juris further questions please
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much for
 
02:13:50.330 --> 02:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
I will now call upon uh Mr and Andre and
 
02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%

02:14:19.310 --> 02:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioner nhdot uh speaks in support
 
02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
of the measure we're generally
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
supportive as you heard in my earlier
 
02:14:26.089 --> 02:14:26.099 align:start position:0%
testimony today of any measure that
 
02:14:28.129 --> 02:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
helps address the long-term structural
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
deficit of our Highway fund this is one
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh approach
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
um in front of you you will also see a
 
02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
letter of support from Mr uh James
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
jalbert who's the chairman of the New
 
02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:45.250 align:start position:0%
jalbert who's the chairman of the New
Hampshire

02:14:45.250 --> 02:14:45.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:14:47.689 --> 02:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
Transportation Council
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
as he points out there's also an hdot's
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
position this is a step in the right
 
02:14:54.589 --> 02:14:54.599 align:start position:0%
direction different states have taken
 
02:14:56.330 --> 02:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
different approaches uh generally
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
between some sort of uh some sort of
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
measure like this that's similar to a
 
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
road toll some states have approached it
 
02:15:08.450 --> 02:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of registration fees as you
 
02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
heard from previous testimonies also
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
being considered by this body or by the
 
02:15:15.169 --> 02:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh by the other body of the legislature
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
uh this approach does have the advantage
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
of acting like a road toll in that uh it
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
does allow out-of-staters tourists to
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
contribute to our highways we're
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
supportive of that approach
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily to the exclusion of a
 
02:15:32.330 --> 02:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
registration fee which we also support
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
again we support any measure in general
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
that goes toward closing the Gap in loss
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
of Highway fund Revenue
 
02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
and I won't reiterate other points but
 
02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
you know all first steps uh tend to be
 
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh imperfect this one certainly is
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
because as you've heard in previous
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
testimony it does not account for most
 
02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
of the home charging at least as it
 
02:15:59.209 --> 02:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
currently stands in the future that may
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
change but at least it would start us on
 
02:16:05.209 --> 02:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
the path of ensuring Equitable uh
 
02:16:08.089 --> 02:16:08.099 align:start position:0%
contributions to our Highway fund
 
02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
and that saw that concludes my testimony
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
and standing by for any questions
 
02:16:14.330 --> 02:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Deputy Commissioner any questions of
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner for members of
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:16:21.770 --> 02:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
any questions all right representation
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair uh so Deputy
 
02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
Commissioner in agreement with more road
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
tolls so we can keep maintaining the
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
highways to the state roads doing things
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
like drainage uh uh pavement markings
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
guard rails Etc
 
02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
do any thoughts in your department or
 
02:16:43.370 --> 02:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
where to place more charges
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
on state property in areas where
 
02:16:48.650 --> 02:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
tourists go or there are heavily
 
02:16:50.929 --> 02:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
trafficked so as you can collect more
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
road toll to help fill the the budget
 
02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
for maintenance and improvements and and
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh and the like that you mentioned in
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:02.099 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you for that
 
02:17:04.610 --> 02:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
question there there are restrictions on
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
our on our ability to use state property
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
for this type of thing
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
um that that's something I testify to uh
 
02:17:13.610 --> 02:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
in the other body when we were talking
 
02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
about uh registration fees
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking uh
 
02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking uh
private

02:17:21.770 --> 02:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
private
 
02:17:23.450 --> 02:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
the you know these types of chargers
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
that are placed on private property
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's funded by us or others or
 
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
privately funded
 
02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
you know can can serve that role you can
 
02:17:37.009 --> 02:17:37.019 align:start position:0%
extract a a road toll-like fee from
 
02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
those uh from those EV Chargers
 
02:17:42.049 --> 02:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
um you've heard under separate testimony
 
02:17:43.730 --> 02:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
here A whole lot of different efforts
 
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
that are going on in our state to uh to
 
02:17:48.169 --> 02:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
improve accessibility in the number of
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
chargers that exist here and those
 
02:17:52.610 --> 02:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
efforts are ongoing both by our
 
02:17:54.290 --> 02:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
department and the other departments
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
represented here
 
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
if I could just do a brief follow-up so
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up please continue in the case of
 
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned earlier there's there's
 
02:18:04.730 --> 02:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
a Motor Vehicle Manufacturer on on
 
02:18:07.250 --> 02:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's got charging stations on Route 93
 
02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
on both sides and there are plazas there
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
where you can stop you can eat you can
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
buy uh products
 
02:18:16.250 --> 02:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
how's that working out do we charge that
 
02:18:19.129 --> 02:18:19.139 align:start position:0%
manufacturer rent does a state charge
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
them rent and then on top of that
 
02:18:26.330 --> 02:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
a usage fee for electricity and those
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
meters they're not currently needed
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
right now are they
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
I would have to get back to you on that
 
02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
on that particular location sir
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
um each each location tends to be a
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
little bit different as you've heard in
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
previous testimony some The Meters
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
separate some The Meters with the
 
02:18:43.969 --> 02:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
facility itself so each is slightly
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
different but if you do have a a
 
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
specific question we're happy to get
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
back to you so for as far as investors
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
go you could engage investors that we've
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
got these properties and there's State
 
02:18:57.770 --> 02:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
Properties put these charging stations
 
02:19:00.410 --> 02:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
up maybe make an incentive a deal for
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
the first few years and then put your
 
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
meters on those charges so as you can
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
collect road toll to help with the
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget
 
02:19:12.770 --> 02:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I think as you heard Mr Evans Brown
 
02:19:15.730 --> 02:19:15.740 align:start position:0%
testified too there's a there's a phased
 
02:19:19.549 --> 02:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh intention here that some of what
 
02:19:21.610 --> 02:19:21.620 align:start position:0%
you're describing will come to pass
 
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
trying to construct a business model
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
that that is attractive to Private
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
Industry is part of the part of the
 
02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
thing that that Most states are working
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
on right now and and trying to figure
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
out what that model looks like
 
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Juris
 
02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:19:41.089 --> 02:19:41.099 align:start position:0%
uh yes of the Deputy go ahead please
 
02:19:42.889 --> 02:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thanks
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
uh if I do my calculations correctly it
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
seems like even if we
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
tax every kilowatt that a electric
 
02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
vehicle uses
 
02:19:56.929 --> 02:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
they traveled 12 000 miles a year which
 
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
I think you said it was the average
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay about 25 dollars
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
right now a gas burning vehicle 25 miles
 
02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
a gallon pays about a hundred so
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
if collecting a hundred dollars per
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle isn't enough
 
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
oh we're only collecting a quarter of
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
that through this vehicle taxes so um
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
question is whether this is really a
 
02:20:25.490 --> 02:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
long-term solution or or whether um
 
02:20:27.170 --> 02:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
we really see this as kind of the first
 
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
step and something else has to be done
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
to solve the problem
 
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the exact shape of this how
 
02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
it how it develops Nationwide is is
 
02:20:37.490 --> 02:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
really in flux right now I mean you see
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
some states experimenting with with one
 
02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:41.660 align:start position:0%
the other both
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
and the Laboratories of democracy are
 
02:20:46.130 --> 02:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
are kind of taken off right now and and
 
02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
we'll see what sticks but uh certainly
 
02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
this is this is one approach that that
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
several states are taking
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
um and that's not again we wouldn't
 
02:20:57.170 --> 02:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
testify that this should happen to the
 
02:20:58.969 --> 02:20:58.979 align:start position:0%
exclusion of a vehicle registration fee
 
02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
but it's one of the other options
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you representative
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
Faulkner for the questions of the Deputy
 
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
Commissioner from the committee any
 
02:21:11.150 --> 02:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
further questions

March 10th hearing from
 
02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:36.349 align:start position:0%
March 10th hearing from
from

02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:24:36.359 --> 02:24:37.969 align:start position:0%
from
agencies

02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:24:41.090 --> 02:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh we have a process I need to bring
 
02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
that forward here
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
so March 13th
 
02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
March 15th 17th and 20th to get through
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
our executive sessions so
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
um Chris Shea is uh or is providing a
 
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
lot of input and going between his
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
duties and working in ways and means in
 
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
ours so there's a little bit of flux
 
02:25:09.469 --> 02:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
here what agencies will come on those
 
02:25:13.969 --> 02:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
days but I just wanted you to have
 
02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
um have that so you could start planning
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
and you know be aware of the fact that
 
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
that may change also
 
02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:27.110 align:start position:0%
that may change also
yes

02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
um many of the um
 
02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
no later than 10 and actually several
 
02:25:35.809 --> 02:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
will start at nine o'clock the the idea
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
is to try and get through as many as we
 
02:25:40.490 --> 02:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
can during the day we also have a
 
02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:42.740 align:start position:0%
request from the Department of Education
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
to do a site visit to a building they're
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
hoping to lease just down the road here
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
and so at some point in time we'll work
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
that in
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
they want us to come by and see that we
 
02:26:00.010 --> 02:26:00.020 align:start position:0%
have a full schedule today
 
02:26:05.450 --> 02:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
but I I wanted to um uh remind everyone
 
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:09.500 align:start position:0%
and I went back to the clerk uh Mr Smith
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
to ask to make sure I had the right
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
understanding uh house rule 44 B permits
 
02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
the chair and ranking member to agree to
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
hold an executive session after a public
 
02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
hearing or to dispose of it I'd ask the
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
question just because we we have had a
 
02:26:29.809 --> 02:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
lot of naming bills and we've been
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
followers following that procedure so I
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted everyone to be aware that we
 
02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
might get to something today that we we
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
can exec but of course I will need to be
 
02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:43.670 align:start position:0%
can exec but of course I will need to be
uh

02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
in agreement with the uh the ranking
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
member to do that
 
02:26:48.479 --> 02:26:50.090 align:start position:0%
member to do that
the

02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:51.770 --> 02:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
I should have another paper here I
 
02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak and then I'll let you go
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.889 --> 02:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
and I'm afraid with the Clutter I don't
 
02:27:06.410 --> 02:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
have it so enjoy your freedom for a few
 
02:27:09.130 --> 02:27:09.140 align:start position:0%
minutes yes representative Abbott
 
02:27:12.050 --> 02:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to
 
02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:14.389 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to
yep

02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
I wanted to give you one John I think
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
you already have them
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh February um in which month
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
March March 6th
 
02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
March 10th
 
02:27:29.450 --> 02:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
March 13th
 
02:27:32.650 --> 02:27:32.660 align:start position:0%
March 15th
 
02:27:38.270 --> 02:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.469 align:start position:0%
 
24th

02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave I'll leave a list here and
 
02:27:50.210 --> 02:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
everyone can take a look and it's it
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
like it's still in a little bit of flux
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh just to throw
 
02:27:58.010 --> 02:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
something out there that I
 
02:28:00.170 --> 02:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
since it's been built I don't think this
 
02:28:02.570 --> 02:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
this committee has gone on any kind of a
 
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
tour of the women's prison the newly
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
development facility oh we have we have
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative yes did I miss that
 
02:28:11.809 --> 02:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
um I think it was prior to your coming
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
onto the committee
 
02:28:16.490 --> 02:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm I'm I'm willing to go look
 
02:28:18.770 --> 02:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
at any facility
 
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
um with a sufficient time to go uh
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could ask for an update of
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
where they are with it I've been several
 
02:28:28.849 --> 02:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
times during construction grand opening
 
02:28:30.889 --> 02:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
the once after but I've heard that it
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
may not be
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
wearing well with the test of time and
 
02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:38.819 align:start position:0%
it might be valuable oh sure okay
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes we did yes yep okay so I I'm
 
02:28:44.929 --> 02:28:44.939 align:start position:0%
we will put that on the list
 
02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else with questions just if you
 
02:28:50.090 --> 02:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
clarify again Shannon
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
when the Chairman's when you're say
 
02:28:54.410 --> 02:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
you're a chairman you're testifying or
 
02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
refer to you as
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh represented as representative and
 
02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
who's ever sitting here would be
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
chairman would be would be chair okay
 
02:29:04.969 --> 02:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
thank you yep no thank you
 
02:29:04.979 --> 02:29:07.130 align:start position:0%
thank you yep no thank you
yes

02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman yes just just a question
 
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
on your schedule that you have do you
 
02:29:16.370 --> 02:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
have anything for February 17th at this
 
02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.969 --> 02:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
yes we have
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and we probably
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's tentative but we have the 15th 17th
 
02:29:30.170 --> 02:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
and 20th
 
02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
and and that would be a start time of
 
02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
nine or ten or well those would be those
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
will be executive sessions when we get
 
02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
when we get down to that point so I
 
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
would say is is 10 o'clock more
 
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
preferable to the committee
 
02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll we'll play with that I I
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
come from the ones coming from further
 
02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
north I like 10 o'clock yeah we're in
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
executive session so I think when we get
 
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
to that point we can probably go to 10
 
02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:07.309 align:start position:0%
to that point we can probably go to 10
o'clock

02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
why don't I just give you a copy okay
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay well I'll I'll say them one more
 
02:30:13.610 --> 02:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
time but if I just gave you guys so
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
February 24th
 
02:30:18.010 --> 02:30:18.020 align:start position:0%
March 6th
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
10th 13
 
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
17 and 20. if I
 
02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
if I were I'm looking for that week of
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
the 14th in February if there's anything
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
that week scheduled
 
02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
I I don't have I don't have a calendar
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
but it looks like we're surrounding it
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.730 --> 02:30:45.740 align:start position:0%
for for new members that signed up and
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
looked at our bill loads and saw that
 
02:30:51.050 --> 02:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
you know we only have seven or 10 or 14
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
bills a year we've had people in the
 
02:30:56.210 --> 02:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
past join on because they thought we
 
02:30:59.210 --> 02:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
didn't have a load you know it's is we
 
02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
have a substantial uh body of work that
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
we need to do not only this year but
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.889 --> 02:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
ah I did have I did find my list here so

several terms back uh what what their
 
02:32:03.170 --> 02:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
position is on that ultimately it will
 
02:32:06.889 --> 02:32:06.899 align:start position:0%

02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay now we're down to 14 minutes so
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:59.210 --> 02:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
apologize for uh the slight delay there
 
02:53:02.389 --> 02:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
I would like to open up the hearing on
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 110 which is prohibiting the
 
02:53:08.330 --> 02:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
use of State funds for new passenger
 
02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
rail projects before I recognize
 
02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:12.790 align:start position:0%
rail projects before I recognize
representative

02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%

on that uh I would work Hackenberg I um
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind everyone that we
 
02:53:25.010 --> 02:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
are going to be here until we've heard
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
all of our testimony
 
02:53:30.290 --> 02:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
um but I would uh suggest when we have a
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
large number of people in attendance uh
 
02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
when it gets time to say what it is you
 
02:53:38.690 --> 02:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
would like to say to this committee if
 
02:53:40.670 --> 02:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
that point has been made previously
 
02:53:44.510 --> 02:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
please please be mindful uh and um
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
either agree with that point or just
 
02:53:50.090 --> 02:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
move over that uh with that I would like
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.010 --> 02:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
Aiden Ankerberg I represent Stratford
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
district 7 which is Rochester's Ward 3.
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
this morning I'm here to introduce House
 
02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
Bill 110. some of you returning members
 
02:54:17.150 --> 02:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
may remember it a feeling of deja vu
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
less less than a year ago I was here
 
02:54:21.889 --> 02:54:21.899 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill 1432 which passed
 
02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
the house in a bipartisan way
 
02:54:27.950 --> 02:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
so this is the exact same language of of
 
02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill all it seeks to do is
 
02:54:33.290 --> 02:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
to prohibit the use of State funds for
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
new passenger rail projects
 
02:54:39.650 --> 02:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
um so obviously we've we've come through
 
02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:40.910 align:start position:0%
um so obviously we've we've come through
the

02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
um the financial plan that was supposed
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
to be released
 
02:54:47.450 --> 02:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
um upon the orders of the executive
 
02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
Council That was supposed to be released
 
02:54:53.389 --> 02:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
on the 31st I have not had access to
 
02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
that despite repeated attempts to see A
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
draft copy of that I contacted both the
 
02:55:01.309 --> 02:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
house Republican office and a number of
 
02:55:02.809 --> 02:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
executive counselors and even through
 
02:55:04.809 --> 02:55:04.819 align:start position:0%
their intervention I still have not seen
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
any data to work off that would change
 
02:55:12.230 --> 02:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
any testimony that I had previously so
 
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
sort of the history of this is in 2014
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.250 --> 02:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
we had those numbers to to go off of
 
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
which I have included in the packets
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
that I handed out to members of the
 
02:55:31.250 --> 02:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
committee also there was an article that
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
I I included titled the
 
02:55:36.590 --> 02:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
the case for commuter rail in New
 
02:55:38.210 --> 02:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire got worse not better in the
 
02:55:39.769 --> 02:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
last seven years which appeared in the
 
02:55:42.010 --> 02:55:42.020 align:start position:0%
Josiah Bartlett Center
 
02:55:44.929 --> 02:55:44.939 align:start position:0%
that mentioned that in 2021 with the
 
02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
updated numbers that they were actually
 
02:55:50.750 --> 02:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
projecting that ridership would drop by
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
eight percent for the capital Corridor
 
02:55:56.809 --> 02:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
project and also that eight percent
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
decline in ridership was occurring even
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
though the number of trips to Manchester
 
02:56:02.450 --> 02:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
doubled going from 16 the original
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
report to 32 in the 2021 update
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
obviously I haven't seen anything
 
02:56:10.490 --> 02:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
further with that as I mentioned in the
 
02:56:12.230 --> 02:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
um that I have not received a copy of
 
02:56:14.050 --> 02:56:14.060 align:start position:0%
that report from Dot
 
02:56:16.849 --> 02:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
also along with the decrease in
 
02:56:19.429 --> 02:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
ridership the costs were actually
 
02:56:21.410 --> 02:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
expected due to inflation a number of
 
02:56:25.010 --> 02:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
other factors to raise uh to Rise
 
02:56:27.250 --> 02:56:27.260 align:start position:0%
um quite dramatically
 
02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
my biggest problem with with this uh
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
proposal again without seeing the the
 
02:56:37.610 --> 02:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
most up-to-date financial analysis of
 
02:56:40.929 --> 02:56:40.939 align:start position:0%
this project would be that
 
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
the recommendations for funding in the
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
2021 report relied on
 
02:56:50.269 --> 02:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
um one method which would be a Transit
 
02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
sales tax I mean I I don't think a sales
 
02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
tax is in keeping with the New Hampshire
 
02:56:58.130 --> 02:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
advantage and uh that this is sort of
 
02:56:59.330 --> 02:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
what spurred
 
02:57:02.929 --> 02:57:02.939 align:start position:0%
my motivation to really uh introduce
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill in the the original form
 
02:57:08.090 --> 02:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
because you know this this is not in
 
02:57:09.530 --> 02:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
keeping with the New Hampshire advantage
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
and for a project which will benefit
 
02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
you know Nashua Merrimack Bedford
 
02:57:18.769 --> 02:57:18.779 align:start position:0%
Manchester I represent Rochester and
 
02:57:20.450 --> 02:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
what are we getting for our money there
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't feel that that is a
 
02:57:24.170 --> 02:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
burden that we should put on the
 
02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in my area and other areas of
 
02:57:28.370 --> 02:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
the state that will not benefit
 
02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:30.110 align:start position:0%
the state that will not benefit
so

02:57:30.110 --> 02:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:31.130 --> 02:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of people
 
02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:32.570 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of people
testifying

02:57:32.570 --> 02:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:57:35.150 --> 02:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I would certainly take questions but
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
I I would recommend that if if the
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
people have questions about
 
02:57:41.210 --> 02:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
how this project is going to be paid for
 
02:57:44.330 --> 02:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
that they would ask those questions of
 
02:57:46.910 --> 02:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Department of
 
02:57:48.889 --> 02:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
Transportation because obviously he
 
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be the one to have the the most
 
02:57:53.690 --> 02:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
up-to-date numbers on that
 
02:57:56.570 --> 02:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bank questions
 
02:58:04.010 --> 02:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:12.050 --> 02:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
I would like to recognize uh
 
02:58:16.190 --> 02:58:16.200 align:start position:0%

02:58:55.070 --> 02:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
oh this almost afternoon so I'm going to
 
02:58:57.889 --> 02:58:57.899 align:start position:0%
say good afternoon I'm David priest I'm
 
02:59:01.490 --> 02:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
a representative of Hillsboro 17.
 
02:59:04.190 --> 02:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh in my previous life I was the
 
02:59:05.990 --> 02:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
executive director for the Southern New
 
02:59:07.790 --> 02:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Planning Commission
 
02:59:10.490 --> 02:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
and one of the emphasis that I placed
 
02:59:12.889 --> 02:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
was on economic development
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the capital corridor
 
02:59:20.030 --> 02:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
and from that aspect I've got to say and
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
stress that
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
the access to passing jewel is very
 
02:59:25.439 --> 02:59:26.630 align:start position:0%
the access to passing jewel is very
important

important
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
for future job growth and economic
 
02:59:32.510 --> 02:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
development Within
 
02:59:35.570 --> 02:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
our state and without it
 
02:59:37.130 --> 02:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
um not see it
 
02:59:43.370 --> 02:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
we have a future of young people who
 
02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
want to come and work in this state but
 
02:59:48.889 --> 02:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
they don't want to they live elsewhere
 
02:59:51.290 --> 02:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
and but they don't own a car and we've
 
02:59:53.870 --> 02:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
seen this many many times
 
02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
and this would provide them access to
 
03:00:00.349 --> 03:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
Nashua and to Manchester and in the
 
03:00:02.210 --> 03:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
cities in between
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I and again I just urge you to
 
03:00:08.690 --> 03:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
oppose 110
 
03:00:11.630 --> 03:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
and to continue the
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
um progress that we are making on making
 
03:00:18.650 --> 03:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
the capital Corridor a reality
 
03:00:21.490 --> 03:00:21.500 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
03:00:25.730 --> 03:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:29.870 --> 03:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:33.230 --> 03:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
those those in the audience uh
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
practices that we tend to go back and
 
03:00:39.469 --> 03:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
forth between those in favor and those
 
03:00:44.269 --> 03:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
opposed and I will go back to uh uh

need for flexibility and we're also
 
03:02:03.469 --> 03:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
seeing that here in New Hampshire
 
03:02:05.450 --> 03:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
depressed rail ridership creates a
 
03:02:07.490 --> 03:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
paradox for Transit officials who must
 
03:02:10.010 --> 03:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
contend with subsidizing a system that
 
03:02:12.290 --> 03:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
people may use less but rely on for
 
03:02:14.690 --> 03:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
service once it's there
 
03:02:16.250 --> 03:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
they say that it will not reach the
 
03:02:17.870 --> 03:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
levels they knew in the past but people
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
won't stop using it they'll use it less
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
because working from home will stay not
 
03:02:23.870 --> 03:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
full-time but part-time
 
03:02:26.570 --> 03:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
Transit agencies in New York managed to
 
03:02:28.490 --> 03:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
save off Draconian service Cuts after
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
receiving billions of dollars in of aid
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
from federal stimulus packages but new
 
03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
revenue streams may be necessary to help
 
03:02:38.929 --> 03:02:38.939 align:start position:0%
bolster the rail in the long run
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
it could rejuvenate the debate about
 
03:02:43.730 --> 03:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
dedicated subsidy streams for revenue
 
03:02:45.889 --> 03:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
for Rail lines and a lot of these were
 
03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:47.399 align:start position:0%
struggling to balance their books even
 
03:02:49.730 --> 03:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
before covid just pulling up from this
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
for a second we're looking at a program
 
03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:53.150 align:start position:0%
for a second we're looking at a program
that

03:02:53.150 --> 03:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
has been implemented in many other areas
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
even with their ridership in established
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
patterns they are needing more and more
 
03:03:02.330 --> 03:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
subsidies and if we do this in New
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how can we guarantee that the
 
03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
federal government or the towns that
 
03:03:07.370 --> 03:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
benefit will do that and that it won't
 
03:03:11.210 --> 03:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
fall to the taxpayers of the state
 
03:03:13.790 --> 03:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
so when you look at this businesses are
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
rethinking where their main hubs will be
 
03:03:17.570 --> 03:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
about staying in Manhattan or not in my
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
experience in Boston a lot of the
 
03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
medical device and other health care
 
03:03:22.730 --> 03:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
companies that I covered moved from
 
03:03:24.530 --> 03:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
being very very close to downtown Boston
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
they moved out to um to the 495 ring
 
03:03:30.889 --> 03:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
because they were better able to have
 
03:03:32.690 --> 03:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
employees get there and they had better
 
03:03:35.330 --> 03:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
costs Boston Scientific is no longer in
 
03:03:37.490 --> 03:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
Natick they're much farther out
 
03:03:39.590 --> 03:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
we've already changed not where we work
 
03:03:41.990 --> 03:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
but how we work and a point-to-point
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
system of commuter rails is
 
03:03:48.830 --> 03:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:51.050 --> 03:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
when we look to the policy matters
 
03:03:53.210 --> 03:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
briefing in that packet from the Josiah
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
bar lip Center for Public Policy about
 
03:03:57.349 --> 03:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
does commuter rail commute create jobs
 
03:03:59.809 --> 03:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
there's actually a case study on what
 
03:04:02.330 --> 03:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
happened here in New Hampshire when
 
03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
service began on the Downeaster in 2001.
 
03:04:08.510 --> 03:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at that Exeter lost 328 jobs
 
03:04:12.170 --> 03:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
Dover gained 1019 jobs and Durham gained
 
03:04:15.410 --> 03:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
11 jobs over that time frame this looks
 
03:04:17.269 --> 03:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
and Compares what happened there versus
 
03:04:20.750 --> 03:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
other similar communities it looked at
 
03:04:22.610 --> 03:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
so I wrote on the back that it looked at
 
03:04:25.070 --> 03:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
Epping to compare to Exeter which gained
 
03:04:28.490 --> 03:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
1400 Jobs versus exeter's loss of 328
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
and then it looked to Rochester as a
 
03:04:32.990 --> 03:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
comparison to Dover which lost 1700 jobs
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the Thousand gained in
 
03:04:37.010 --> 03:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
Dover a lot of that was the shift to
 
03:04:39.530 --> 03:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
Service as opposed to manufacturing and
 
03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:41.939 align:start position:0%
as we have more jobs that are in the
 
03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
office moving to hybrid we're looking at
 
03:04:45.410 --> 03:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
our essential workers getting getting
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%

10 percent
 
03:05:13.450 --> 03:05:13.460 align:start position:0%
um over Christmas I was in San Diego
 
03:05:15.889 --> 03:05:15.899 align:start position:0%
helping my mother-in-law move from a

living facility as Vice chairman of
 
03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I was curious
 
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
about the impacts of the workforce
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
because they had severe Staffing
 
03:05:27.410 --> 03:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
shortages there's a new trolley line in
 
03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
San Diego that opened up and it's only a
 
03:05:32.210 --> 03:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
few miles from these two facilities
 
03:05:34.969 --> 03:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
but the number one problem with getting
 
03:05:36.530 --> 03:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
employees to these Health Care
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
Facilities was unreliable Transportation
 
03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
even with the trolley getting them five
 
03:05:42.410 --> 03:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
miles away
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
there were public city buses that
 
03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
weren't on time they couldn't get an
 
03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
Uber or have another way to close that
 
03:05:48.359 --> 03:05:49.429 align:start position:0%
Uber or have another way to close that
Gap

03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
Gap
 
03:05:51.530 --> 03:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that there are some
 
03:05:53.210 --> 03:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
benefits that could come from the towns
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would be served but they're not
 
03:05:56.570 --> 03:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
benefits that will be widespread enough
 
03:05:58.610 --> 03:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
to obligate the rest of the people of
 
03:06:00.650 --> 03:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to pay for this if there's
 
03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
another funding stream whether it's
 
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
Federal whether it's local to those
 
03:06:06.349 --> 03:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
areas I have no problem with them
 
03:06:09.050 --> 03:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
pursuing this this strategy this program
 
03:06:11.570 --> 03:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
that's that's time probably has passed
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
but if they can find the funding that's
 
03:06:15.889 --> 03:06:15.899 align:start position:0%
fine but obligating the people of New
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who will likely never set foot
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
on those trains to pay for the cost
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
overruns and the subsidies that will be
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
required I believe is inappropriate and
 
03:06:27.170 --> 03:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
that's why I co-sponsored this bill last
 
03:06:30.830 --> 03:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
year and again this year thank you
 
03:06:32.330 --> 03:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
questions for yes representative Boyd
 
03:06:37.969 --> 03:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and representative
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
land thank you very much for your
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
testimony just a quick question it's a
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
curiosity thing during the context of
 
03:06:44.690 --> 03:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
your research that you happen to do
 
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
analysis and analyzes of The Rail Runner
 
03:06:49.010 --> 03:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
in New Mexico which runs from Belen
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
through Albuquerque up to Santa Fe
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you I did not look at that one
 
03:06:54.769 --> 03:06:54.779 align:start position:0%
but New Mexico is not a state that we
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
would want to emulate
 
03:06:57.230 --> 03:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
um we actually drove through there
 
03:06:58.849 --> 03:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
because we drove to and from California
 
03:07:04.250 --> 03:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
and while Albuquerque hasn't declined as
 
03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
much as the other parts of New Mexico
 
03:07:09.010 --> 03:07:09.020 align:start position:0%
since I spent a few weeks there back in
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
2004. it really is a state on the
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
decline and I do not think we should
 
03:07:16.010 --> 03:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
model any of our policies on New Mexico
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you very much thank you
 
03:07:26.450 --> 03:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.190 --> 03:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
is have you noticed a lot of
 
03:07:30.410 --> 03:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
construction along the Rail lines for
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
housing and and uh businesses in terms
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
of commuter rail and close to the home
 
03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
in Boston the developments that happen
 
03:07:43.490 --> 03:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
around the uh the new Green Line the new
 
03:07:46.130 --> 03:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
Green Line in uh Summerville and Medford
 
03:07:48.769 --> 03:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
and the and the
 
03:07:50.269 --> 03:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
the rail line that's going to happen
 
03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
down to New Bedford the commuter rail
 
03:07:55.250 --> 03:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
line and the anticipation of
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in terms of the
 
03:07:59.929 --> 03:07:59.939 align:start position:0%
economic activity and the housing
 
03:07:59.939 --> 03:08:01.010 align:start position:0%
economic activity and the housing
activity

03:08:01.010 --> 03:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
activity
 
03:08:04.730 --> 03:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
have you looked at that in in places
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
like Nashville and Manchester
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question they may
 
03:08:10.370 --> 03:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
be building in anticipation but when you
 
03:08:12.530 --> 03:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
look at those last mile closure areas
 
03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
you're looking at benefiting a very very
 
03:08:17.030 --> 03:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
small geographic area directly around
 
03:08:19.309 --> 03:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
those stations if you're looking to
 
03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
spread that Economic Development beyond
 
03:08:23.809 --> 03:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
that walkable distance from a station
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're looking at adding additional
 
03:08:27.469 --> 03:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
public transportation infrastructure
 
03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
that also needs to have reliability in
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
order to allow people to get to their
 
03:08:34.610 --> 03:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
jobs this was actually an issue that I
 
03:08:36.349 --> 03:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
dealt with when I was commuting on the
 
03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
bus down to Boston if anybody who didn't
 
03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
work right downtown would have to rely
 
03:08:45.889 --> 03:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
on the MBTA and the T or the city buses
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
in order to get to their other jobs it
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
was unfeasible and unpracticable for
 
03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
anybody who did not live near South
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
state did not work now near South
 
03:08:56.210 --> 03:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
Station or in the financial district
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
where they did morning drop-offs to
 
03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
actually take the bus because the time
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
and cost in involved between taking the
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
T or the bus to get to that Central Hub
 
03:09:08.929 --> 03:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
of South Station was prohibitive and I
 
03:09:10.730 --> 03:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
don't think that it would be any more
 
03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
feasible outside of those immediately
 
03:09:15.769 --> 03:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
concentrated areas to see much of a
 
03:09:18.410 --> 03:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
benefit in the Josiah Bartlett study
 
03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
there is a study of the MBTA commuter
 
03:09:23.090 --> 03:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
rail system that had that that showed
 
03:09:24.650 --> 03:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
that the development patterns actually
 
03:09:28.130 --> 03:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
were not as related to those sites as it
 
03:09:30.889 --> 03:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
would at first appear when you looked at
 
03:09:33.530 --> 03:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
the it's in that document I didn't want
 
03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
to dive too deeply into it so I'll let
 
03:09:38.210 --> 03:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
you look to that document thank you
 
03:09:40.849 --> 03:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent Faulkner yes I wonder if
 
03:09:45.410 --> 03:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
you can talk a little bit about the
 
03:09:47.570 --> 03:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
amount of construction of new office
 
03:09:49.610 --> 03:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
space in downtown Boston
 
03:09:52.250 --> 03:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
which is where this line would serve and
 
03:09:53.809 --> 03:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
the differential and salaries between
 
03:09:55.610 --> 03:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
Boston and uh
 
03:09:58.849 --> 03:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
in the suburbs and New Hampshire and
 
03:09:58.859 --> 03:10:00.290 align:start position:0%
in the suburbs and New Hampshire and
uh

03:10:00.290 --> 03:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
and how that plays into the benefit of
 
03:10:04.490 --> 03:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
this uh thank you it actually has not
 
03:10:06.349 --> 03:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
been a concentration in downtown Boston
 
03:10:08.690 --> 03:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
it has been Fortune 500 companies
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
leaving Boston to go further out to
 
03:10:14.690 --> 03:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
enhance the commuter and also to enhance
 
03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
the cost it's a lot less expensive for
 
03:10:19.610 --> 03:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
companies like Boston Scientific to be
 
03:10:22.370 --> 03:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
further out and to then have a more
 
03:10:24.349 --> 03:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
drivable area where their employees can
 
03:10:26.090 --> 03:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
go out to lunch as opposed to just be in
 
03:10:28.250 --> 03:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria when they were in Natick
 
03:10:29.870 --> 03:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
that was actually something that hurt
 
03:10:32.450 --> 03:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
their recruiting efforts they were one
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
of the companies that I covered closely
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
for over a decade also I've spoken with
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
people who are in commercial real estate
 
03:10:41.150 --> 03:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
in Boston and they're having severe
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
tenancy issues there there are a lot of
 
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
people who now that there's a mix of
 
03:10:47.269 --> 03:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
hybrid don't see the value of having
 
03:10:49.730 --> 03:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
those offices in downtown Boston and is
 
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
saying a lot higher vacancy rates for
 
03:10:53.630 --> 03:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
his property management business thank
 
03:10:55.969 --> 03:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
03:10:59.090 --> 03:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you represent land thank you
 
03:11:01.429 --> 03:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
I would like to call
 
03:11:01.439 --> 03:11:02.210 align:start position:0%
I would like to call
um

03:11:02.210 --> 03:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:16.210 --> 03:11:16.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:19.969 --> 03:11:19.979 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all I represent uh
 
03:11:24.650 --> 03:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.050 --> 03:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
and I want to answer to a couple of
 
03:11:29.210 --> 03:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
statements that were made one was the
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
fact that um I think the representative
 
03:11:35.389 --> 03:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
from Rochester saw no benefit to
 
03:11:38.330 --> 03:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
projects such as Rail lines and I'm here
 
03:11:39.530 --> 03:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
to tell you
 
03:11:42.769 --> 03:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
that I drive to Dover to take the train
 
03:11:46.730 --> 03:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
to Boston because I can't stand 93 and
 
03:11:49.250 --> 03:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
it also alleviates me from having the
 
03:11:52.490 --> 03:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
park in Boston so I take the 45 minute
 
03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
ride to Dover I hop on the train and
 
03:11:57.889 --> 03:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
there I am but I quite often stop in
 
03:11:57.899 --> 03:11:59.150 align:start position:0%
there I am but I quite often stop in
Rochester

03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
03:12:01.309 --> 03:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps to get gas perhaps to run into
 
03:12:03.290 --> 03:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
Cumberland Farms or perhaps to go to a
 
03:12:04.550 --> 03:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant so
 
03:12:07.130 --> 03:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
I do a little bit of an economic
 
03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
boom to the city of Rochester because
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get the train in Dover and
 
03:12:15.530 --> 03:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
I suspect that happens with a lot of
 
03:12:17.450 --> 03:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
other people I've been doing this route
 
03:12:20.030 --> 03:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
on on the Downeaster for
 
03:12:23.210 --> 03:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
probably close to 10 years now again for
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
the reason I stated and I've taken time
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
to speak to a lot of people I saw that
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
Downeaster at its full capacity before
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
the virus and after the virus now we're
 
03:12:36.889 --> 03:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
it's building back up and this past
 
03:12:36.899 --> 03:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
it's building back up and this past
Friday

03:12:38.389 --> 03:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps it was a week ago Friday I took
 
03:12:43.330 --> 03:12:43.340 align:start position:0%
the 345 out and the train was sold out
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
and I probably should count I do have
 
03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
pitches because I'm always amazed at how
 
03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
many people get off an Exeter their arm
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
and then Dover I can catch the six
 
03:12:57.410 --> 03:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
15 a.m train and see a lot of people
 
03:12:59.929 --> 03:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
going south
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
going north I'm always
 
03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
astounded how well the state of Maine
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
has been doing with this service because
 
03:13:09.650 --> 03:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
I see people with suitcases
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
and one time I went up to have was
 
03:13:14.290 --> 03:13:14.300 align:start position:0%
actually Thanksgiving I went up to
 
03:13:17.450 --> 03:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
Portland to just have Thanksgiving with
 
03:13:19.490 --> 03:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
some friends and there was a whole
 
03:13:21.230 --> 03:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
family going north and I just noticed
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
them and then they were on this same
 
03:13:24.650 --> 03:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
evening train going back and I said to
 
03:13:26.210 --> 03:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
them so did you guys come up for dinner
 
03:13:28.130 --> 03:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
like I said no we've never been up to
 
03:13:29.510 --> 03:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
Portland before we just thought we'd
 
03:13:32.389 --> 03:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
come up and find a place to eat and uh
 
03:13:34.250 --> 03:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
and check this city out that's what
 
03:13:36.290 --> 03:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're missing here we're talking about
 
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
commuters and that's great but we're
 
03:13:41.929 --> 03:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
also missing people that travel and like
 
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
to travel by rail versus bus or dealing
 
03:13:48.170 --> 03:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
with vehicles and being in Laconia I
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
realize that's not on the capital
 
03:13:51.889 --> 03:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
Corridor but nonetheless the tracks run
 
03:13:53.570 --> 03:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
right up through there and God forbid
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
maybe at some point will have enough
 
03:13:58.010 --> 03:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
foresight in his state to push push it
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
further north and and benefit from that
 
03:14:04.490 --> 03:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't have any stuff from
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
political or all these think tanks
 
03:14:09.050 --> 03:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
because most of them are very I think
 
03:14:11.330 --> 03:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
self-serving maybe I should have gone
 
03:14:13.610 --> 03:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
around and got a petition and come down
 
03:14:15.050 --> 03:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
here with thousands of signatures
 
03:14:17.929 --> 03:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
because everybody I talked to in my
 
03:14:21.170 --> 03:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
hometown in Laconia and other places in
 
03:14:23.210 --> 03:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
the state all say the same thing
 
03:14:28.610 --> 03:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
why are we not doing this and as far as
 
03:14:30.889 --> 03:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned that this was you
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
know they mentioned something about a
 
03:14:34.849 --> 03:14:34.859 align:start position:0%
potential sales tax or something like
 
03:14:37.610 --> 03:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
that and that's not to the New Hampshire
 
03:14:39.230 --> 03:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage I would love to remind
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
everybody have here we have a meals and
 
03:14:42.410 --> 03:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
rooms tax
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
and I know in the last session I think
 
03:14:48.889 --> 03:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
it was you the state legislators and the
 
03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
Senate reduced it by a half a percent or
 
03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
something like that and um I you know I
 
03:14:57.290 --> 03:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see the state doing away with
 
03:14:59.630 --> 03:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
that to increase our so-called New
 
03:15:02.330 --> 03:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage uh by not having all
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
these people come into the state help
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
pay our expenses
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't see that that would be
 
03:15:10.730 --> 03:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
an issue and again
 
03:15:14.090 --> 03:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
has anybody here taken the Downeaster
 
03:15:16.929 --> 03:15:16.939 align:start position:0%
I asked this I think two years ago
 
03:15:19.550 --> 03:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative you could uh contain your
 
03:15:23.929 --> 03:15:23.939 align:start position:0%
okay well this is I understand that I
 
03:15:25.190 --> 03:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
understand that but I just want to
 
03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
publicly say uh to help educate you on
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
on the people that take the New
 
03:15:31.849 --> 03:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents to take that train
 
03:15:33.590 --> 03:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be more than happy to pick up the
 
03:15:37.130 --> 03:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
fair uh at my expense to uh because I
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
think everybody on this committee should
 
03:15:41.150 --> 03:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
and do a little more investigating on
 
03:15:44.210 --> 03:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
what this what they have there how that
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
would benefit the center of the state
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
right up right up through especially
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
through Concord thank you thank you for
 
03:15:51.530 --> 03:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there questions for
 
03:15:53.870 --> 03:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:16.849 --> 03:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.830 --> 03:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:16:20.210 --> 03:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
public works
 
03:16:22.190 --> 03:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
I reckon I'm Ralph boam Hillsboro
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
district 14 town of Litchfield
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
in the early 90s
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
30 years ago Neely I was on Judd reg's
 
03:16:34.010 --> 03:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
Railway Commission
 
03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
probably the only one around that was on
 
03:16:38.809 --> 03:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
that commission we studied bringing
 
03:16:42.050 --> 03:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
commuter rail to Nashua we had many
 
03:16:44.330 --> 03:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
meetings for a whole year
 
03:16:47.290 --> 03:16:47.300 align:start position:0%
met at what was called then
 
03:16:49.610 --> 03:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
Nashua Tech which is the Community
 
03:16:49.620 --> 03:16:50.690 align:start position:0%
Nashua Tech which is the Community
College

03:16:50.690 --> 03:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
College
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
and included representatives from the
 
03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:54.650 align:start position:0%
and included representatives from the
MBTA

03:16:54.650 --> 03:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
MBTA
 
03:16:57.050 --> 03:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
after a year discussing and looking at
 
03:16:59.090 --> 03:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
the issues it would determine that
 
03:17:01.570 --> 03:17:01.580 align:start position:0%
computer rail was not financially
 
03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
feasible more so now
 
03:17:07.490 --> 03:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
it would determine that the tracks from
 
03:17:09.469 --> 03:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
Lowell up would have to be completely
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
replaced and include turn off tracks the
 
03:17:15.710 --> 03:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
existing track is 15 mile an hour
 
03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:16.969 align:start position:0%
existing track is 15 mile an hour
Freight

03:17:16.969 --> 03:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
Freight
 
03:17:19.010 --> 03:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
and worse now is there are less train
 
03:17:22.490 --> 03:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
traffic 15 Mile now because the rails
 
03:17:24.889 --> 03:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
does this
 
03:17:27.710 --> 03:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
not suitable for
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
commuter rail
 
03:17:31.730 --> 03:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
and then of course we have the initial
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
cost of the trains the upkeep of the
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
trains Etc or that coming from my other
 
03:17:40.849 --> 03:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
pocket my federal taxes
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the MBTA operation is paid for by a big
 
03:17:47.469 --> 03:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
portion of the Massachusetts sales tax
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
and property tax
 
03:17:53.809 --> 03:17:53.819 align:start position:0%
for most of the towns east of 495 and I
 
03:17:55.849 --> 03:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
remembered a few years I was living in
 
03:17:58.730 --> 03:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
Hudson Mass and even though the rail
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
never went through Hudson we had it on
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
our property tax bill is that going to
 
03:18:06.170 --> 03:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
happen here
 
03:18:06.180 --> 03:18:07.670 align:start position:0%
happen here
and

03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:10.250 --> 03:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
and we know that the MBTA is having
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
financial problems also as we mentioned
 
03:18:15.170 --> 03:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
the Downeaster
 
03:18:17.450 --> 03:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
going through Dover that's bam track
 
03:18:19.010 --> 03:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with New
 
03:18:21.429 --> 03:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is Amtrak and substitute
 
03:18:25.250 --> 03:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the federal government and
 
03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:26.210 align:start position:0%
subsidized by the federal government and
their

03:18:26.210 --> 03:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
losing money every year
 
03:18:32.570 --> 03:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
the argument that all transportation is
 
03:18:35.690 --> 03:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
subsidized only goes so far yes in our
 
03:18:37.969 --> 03:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
property taxes we pay for Road plowing
 
03:18:41.090 --> 03:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
improvements Etc but we can control that
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
by our vote
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
there will not be any way to say no to
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
an estate State imposed subsidy tax or
 
03:18:51.469 --> 03:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
whatever kind that's going to be we all
 
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
use the roads a very small minority
 
03:18:56.929 --> 03:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
minority will use the rail and why
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
should I pay to make it cheaper for
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
someone to go to Massachusetts and why
 
03:19:04.010 --> 03:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
should we make it easier for New
 
03:19:05.929 --> 03:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents to work in
 
03:19:08.690 --> 03:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and apparent and if a
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic what a better way to transmit
 
03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
it than on a train
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
instead of bending more on trains the
 
03:19:18.050 --> 03:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
money should be spent on New Hampshire
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
making it more cost effective for
 
03:19:22.730 --> 03:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
businesses to do move to New Hampshire
 
03:19:25.610 --> 03:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
so that workers don't have to commute
 
03:19:28.190 --> 03:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
this bill will only increase state taxes
 
03:19:30.670 --> 03:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
forcing companies out of New Hampshire
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
if Manchester and Nashville want
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
computer rail then they can pay for it
 
03:19:38.990 --> 03:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
and let those that use a service pay for
 
03:19:42.650 --> 03:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
it I use the words my gas tax pays for
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
it by the way even Vehicles now use the
 
03:19:47.210 --> 03:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
road for free but that was another bill
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you representative
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%

03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
um speaking uh opposing opposing the
 
03:20:35.570 --> 03:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
bill I would like to bring forward
 
03:20:39.410 --> 03:20:39.420 align:start position:0%

03:21:01.190 --> 03:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
testimony I I have not had that pleasure

my lunch too and I have another bill at
 
03:21:13.010 --> 03:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
once be precise thank you so I'm written
 
03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan I'm from Stratford
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
counties district 10 which is uh
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
which is uh uh the town of Durham which
 
03:21:24.410 --> 03:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
is in Amtrak City we contribute 42 000
 
03:21:26.570 --> 03:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh writers last year it's going to be
 
03:21:29.809 --> 03:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
more I think in future years to the 467
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
000 Rising who ride the Downeaster
 
03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:32.870 align:start position:0%
000 Rising who ride the Downeaster
um

03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:34.610 --> 03:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get too partisan but
 
03:21:35.570 --> 03:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
from a
 
03:21:35.580 --> 03:21:36.889 align:start position:0%
from a
place

03:21:36.889 --> 03:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
but from a uh ideological perspective
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard that Josiah Bartlett Senator
 
03:21:44.269 --> 03:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned two or three times as a
 
03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
Libertarian think tank it's the one
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
thing Libertarians representative you
 
03:21:49.969 --> 03:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
could container yes well we just any
 
03:21:52.610 --> 03:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
case um we have heard about the desire
 
03:21:56.090 --> 03:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
Bartlett the sales tax and Massachusetts
 
03:21:57.889 --> 03:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
and we are in a symbiotic relationship
 
03:22:00.410 --> 03:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
with Massachusetts our two communities
 
03:22:02.210 --> 03:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
are divided by much as we like to think
 
03:22:03.469 --> 03:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
we have nothing to do with Massachusetts
 
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
we're just we're one Community we're
 
03:22:08.090 --> 03:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
divided by an arbitrarily drawn line
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um anyway
 
03:22:12.050 --> 03:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
so he's stricted primarily against the
 
03:22:14.210 --> 03:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
national Manchester Concord line but the
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
way I read the bill
 
03:22:17.690 --> 03:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
um I think it would effectively and
 
03:22:19.969 --> 03:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
prevent any upgrades too or extensions
 
03:22:21.889 --> 03:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
of the existing Amtrak Downeaster
 
03:22:23.929 --> 03:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
service which I think has been very
 
03:22:25.730 --> 03:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
successful and uh
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
can be even more successful in the
 
03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:28.550 align:start position:0%
can be even more successful in the
future

03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:22:28.560 --> 03:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
future
um

03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:31.550 --> 03:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
so it would even I don't even know he'd
 
03:22:32.690 --> 03:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
use State funding and approve the
 
03:22:34.250 --> 03:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
parking lots or access roads New
 
03:22:36.230 --> 03:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's existing Amtrak stations and
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
we did hear about the last mile problem
 
03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
and you know that's uh that's a real
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
problem but um that exists all already
 
03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
problem but um that exists all already
um

03:22:45.590 --> 03:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
something that's not on my written
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I have a note here about is uh
 
03:22:51.230 --> 03:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
the town Easter because although has a
 
03:22:53.090 --> 03:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
stop at Freeport Maine and you can like
 
03:22:54.769 --> 03:22:54.779 align:start position:0%
ride the train walk all the way up that
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
little bean and you might say well why
 
03:22:59.630 --> 03:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
would anybody do such a thing Maine has
 
03:23:02.570 --> 03:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
a broad-based sales tax well the reason
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
they don't pull off at Durham or Dover
 
03:23:07.010 --> 03:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
exit and go to the stores here in New
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's various reasons but
 
03:23:10.849 --> 03:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
one is like the last mile problem you
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
know there's
 
03:23:14.090 --> 03:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get to the uh the malls you
 
03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
know they're not located near the train
 
03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
station but um and also of course they
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
build a destination shopping facility up
 
03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
there in Freeport so if people are
 
03:23:24.170 --> 03:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
willing to pay the extra 6.5 uh to go up
 
03:23:25.370 --> 03:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
there and of course A lot of them come
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts where the sales tax
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's about the same so um
 
03:23:33.110 --> 03:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it's problematic for UNH the
 
03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
station is right in the heart of Campus
 
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
all that's funds even though most of
 
03:23:38.030 --> 03:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
them don't come from the state budget I
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
think they're going to ask for about 90
 
03:23:42.769 --> 03:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
million 95 million of the billion dollar
 
03:23:44.330 --> 03:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
budget for the whole system it's a small
 
03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
percentage but other the other 98.5
 
03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
percent is also State funds I'm not sure
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
whether they could use those
 
03:23:53.809 --> 03:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
you know to improve the station there's
 
03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
even a problem of the UNH Dairy Bar
 
03:23:57.530 --> 03:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
restaurant with popular Lunch Spot in
 
03:23:59.150 --> 03:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
Durham which is operated by the
 
03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
university and located at the terrain
 
03:24:03.290 --> 03:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
station and um
 
03:24:06.769 --> 03:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to tune the motives of the
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors from my written tells him does
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
question their judgment a little bit
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
first of all Rochester Rochester
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
benefits from the train and represent
 
03:24:17.090 --> 03:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
Sinclair uh alluded to that um it's a
 
03:24:20.210 --> 03:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
short ride from from Dover it's uh
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's just about eight miles
 
03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
down uh Route 16 or Route 108 so it's
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
very near Dover there probably are I'm
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
sure represent Sinclair is not the only
 
03:24:31.070 --> 03:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
person who passes through Rochester on
 
03:24:32.750 --> 03:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
the way to pick up the Amtrak in Dover
 
03:24:35.210 --> 03:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
or Durham
 
03:24:38.870 --> 03:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
and uh although then there's going to be
 
03:24:40.250 --> 03:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
five stations as well we haven't
 
03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
discussion yep we're here by the
 
03:24:44.690 --> 03:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
Merrimack River Corridor uh two of the
 
03:24:46.729 --> 03:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
sponsors from Hudson
 
03:24:49.010 --> 03:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
Hudson uh and there's going to be
 
03:24:51.170 --> 03:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
stations we know in South Nashville by
 
03:24:53.750 --> 03:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
the circumferential highway bridge and I
 
03:24:55.010 --> 03:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
think the site has already been picked
 
03:24:57.889 --> 03:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
out for this one in uh downtown Nashua
 
03:24:59.929 --> 03:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
near the Bridge Street Bridge route 101a
 
03:25:03.229 --> 03:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
and the South Nashville station and I
 
03:25:05.090 --> 03:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
guess somebody would have to provide a
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
bus service probably the employer it's
 
03:25:06.960 --> 03:25:08.510 align:start position:0%
bus service probably the employer it's
about

03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's a very serious plan to build a
 
03:25:13.250 --> 03:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
industrial and or distribution facility
 
03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
right across the river from where the
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
train station would go right across here
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
from South
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
Nashville which is protected can deploy
 
03:25:23.389 --> 03:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
over 2 000 people they actually said 2
 
03:25:25.490 --> 03:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
100 in the latest presentations playing
 
03:25:27.050 --> 03:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
for it but you know it's a significant
 
03:25:29.769 --> 03:25:29.779 align:start position:0%
number of people um it would be
 
03:25:31.849 --> 03:25:31.859 align:start position:0%
even if the
 
03:25:33.530 --> 03:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
whether the Regional Transit Authority
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
in Nashville Hudson area doesn't provide
 
03:25:37.969 --> 03:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
a bus it would be simple to have a
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
shuttle bus provided by the employer so
 
03:25:43.010 --> 03:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
that could keep 2 000 cars a lot of
 
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
those two thousand cars could be kept
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
off the road or they could just get off
 
03:25:47.809 --> 03:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
the train in South Nashville you know
 
03:25:49.309 --> 03:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
get picked up by the shuttle bus and
 
03:25:51.769 --> 03:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
just ride across and get to work so
 
03:25:54.590 --> 03:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh Nashville is right near downtown
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
Hudson it's when the walking distance
 
03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
that would certainly be good for
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
downtown Hudson If people could take the
 
03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
train up to the Nashville station good
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
for Nashua too
 
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
the other two
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
um oh then there's going to be probably
 
03:26:08.809 --> 03:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
Bedford it might be in Merrimack but
 
03:26:10.429 --> 03:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
right by where the Raymond Resort Bridge
 
03:26:13.309 --> 03:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
passes over the uh the representative
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
gets suspend for a moment
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like to get back on topic for
 
03:26:20.330 --> 03:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
your support of this bill please
 
03:26:22.670 --> 03:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
opposition well because I'm explaining
 
03:26:24.650 --> 03:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
why the why the uh
 
03:26:27.769 --> 03:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
why the project is a good idea and why I
 
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
think the ideological concerns about
 
03:26:32.690 --> 03:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
train travel are misplaced um and I
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
think it can be successful obviously you
 
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
need subsidies but highways need
 
03:26:37.790 --> 03:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
subsidies bus service
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
the airports
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
which I'm about to talk about requires
 
03:26:43.849 --> 03:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
subsidies um none of them are supported
 
03:26:45.650 --> 03:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
entirely of the fair backs at Fair box
 
03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
and none them really only affect people
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
who ride the trains because there's
 
03:26:51.050 --> 03:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
always development around uh trained
 
03:26:51.060 --> 03:26:52.370 align:start position:0%
always development around uh trained
hubs

03:26:52.370 --> 03:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
hubs
 
03:26:54.670 --> 03:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
um so anyway
 
03:26:57.229 --> 03:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester Regional Boston Regional
 
03:26:59.090 --> 03:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
Airport MHT as we call it is currently
 
03:27:02.750 --> 03:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
one of the only two major airports
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
in New England region that doesn't have
 
03:27:07.190 --> 03:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
rail service at least doesn't have rail
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
service within a few miles um so uh the
 
03:27:11.929 --> 03:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
other is Bangor International Airport a
 
03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
very small air
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
airport in a remote rural part of Maine
 
03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:16.670 align:start position:0%
airport in a remote rural part of Maine
um

03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:19.130 --> 03:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
and that would uh and they already do a
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
bus service to Manchester to Manchester
 
03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
Boston Regional Airport but that would
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know we could have uh if we were
 
03:27:26.990 --> 03:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
really dreaming we could probably build
 
03:27:28.849 --> 03:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
a light rail line along the line of the
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
Raymond Resort Parkway but certainly it
 
03:27:32.570 --> 03:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take much to
 
03:27:34.729 --> 03:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
have a bus line that picks people up the
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
state station and drops them off at the
 
03:27:38.929 --> 03:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
train to interface with it and
 
03:27:41.150 --> 03:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
finally there's a station in downtown
 
03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:42.650 align:start position:0%
finally there's a station in downtown
Manchester

03:27:42.650 --> 03:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm represented by the rail yard I
 
03:27:47.389 --> 03:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
think I understand it for a moment yes
 
03:27:50.929 --> 03:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
they um I I appreciate the philosophical
 
03:27:53.330 --> 03:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
effort going here and prohibit I think
 
03:27:56.690 --> 03:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
it's bad Bill and and I I've heard many
 
03:28:00.410 --> 03:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
examples of relevant uh relevant to that
 
03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
but um I just want to make sure that you
 
03:28:06.710 --> 03:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
know your testimony is is prohibiting
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
the use of State funds for new passenger
 
03:28:11.630 --> 03:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
rail projects yes please
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can effectively
 
03:28:15.239 --> 03:28:15.950 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can effectively
um

03:28:15.950 --> 03:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:17.690 --> 03:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
I don't mean I don't think it's possible
 
03:28:20.750 --> 03:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
to build a uh Rail Project without State
 
03:28:23.090 --> 03:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
funds just as it's not you know just as
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be possible to start a new
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
bus service without at least some you
 
03:28:28.130 --> 03:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
know interfacing with the state
 
03:28:29.929 --> 03:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
government state funds so I just I think
 
03:28:31.190 --> 03:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea and I don't think
 
03:28:33.170 --> 03:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
there's any way to do it without State
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
funds um when there are and there is a
 
03:28:37.250 --> 03:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
lot of uh there's a large pot of money
 
03:28:39.050 --> 03:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's available it would be a lot of it
 
03:28:40.670 --> 03:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
would be Federal subsidies not that we
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
like the federal government too much but
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
I think I mean the money
 
03:28:47.210 --> 03:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
the money is is there it's just a
 
03:28:49.070 --> 03:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
question of how we allocate it and I
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
think it's uh so I think it's
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
short-sighted uh
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
short-sighted uh not to uh not to build
 
03:28:56.809 --> 03:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
this rail line or at least consider
 
03:28:58.250 --> 03:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
building it oh and the last thing I want
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
to say is uh for all of us the uh
 
03:29:03.050 --> 03:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
the Concord station it's going to be
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere near the state house to
 
03:29:06.650 --> 03:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
re-develop they've already started
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
redeveloping you know the area by the
 
03:29:09.889 --> 03:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
train station on the fire side of store
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
Street and that's going to be somewhere
 
03:29:13.130 --> 03:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
in there I'm going to guess probably
 
03:29:14.929 --> 03:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
near where the existing bus station is
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:29:18.590 --> 03:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
that will probably be within walking
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
distance of state house so that'll be
 
03:29:22.429 --> 03:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
very convenient for legislators and
 
03:29:24.769 --> 03:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
non-legislators and alike who want to
 
03:29:27.050 --> 03:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
come up and visit the state house and
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
testifying bills or serve in the
 
03:29:30.769 --> 03:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
legislatures that'd be like very good
 
03:29:32.030 --> 03:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
03:29:34.010 --> 03:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
everybody along that court or if you
 
03:29:35.450 --> 03:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
could take a train to the state house
 
03:29:37.130 --> 03:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
instead of even though we're going to
 
03:29:38.330 --> 03:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
have a new parking garage eventually
 
03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
like trying to park in that story Street
 
03:29:41.690 --> 03:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
garage and everything so that's also
 
03:29:44.210 --> 03:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
beneficial so uh
 
03:29:46.370 --> 03:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for getting too
 
03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
philosophical but I think this is a good
 
03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
idea and I certainly think you need to
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
clarify that it doesn't do anything
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
about to harm the that we can still
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
support the existing train lines that
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
are already there aside from the
 
03:30:00.769 --> 03:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
Downeaster uh the vice chair also lives
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
in Claremont which has a station
 
03:30:04.250 --> 03:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so thank you thank you very much and
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody wants to answer any
 
03:30:07.490 --> 03:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
questions I suppose they can and I
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
certainly worry about lunch I'll handle
 
03:30:10.610 --> 03:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
that for you are there any
 
03:30:13.130 --> 03:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
Representatives who wish to ask question
 
03:30:13.140 --> 03:30:13.849 align:start position:0%
Representatives who wish to ask question
um

03:30:13.849 --> 03:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:13.859 --> 03:30:15.349 align:start position:0%
um
please

03:30:15.349 --> 03:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:30:15.359 --> 03:30:17.210 align:start position:0%
please
representative

03:30:17.210 --> 03:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:30:19.130 --> 03:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
03:30:20.809 --> 03:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan for your
 
03:30:23.090 --> 03:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
testimony the Downeaster came into
 
03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
existence on December 15 2001 and has
 
03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
been running through the town of Durham
 
03:30:31.610 --> 03:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
for for 20 some odd years what do you
 
03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
think has been prohibitive in preventing
 
03:30:35.570 --> 03:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
the am uh Downeaster from being able to
 
03:30:36.769 --> 03:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
improve Economic Development
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities in Durham
 
03:30:40.910 --> 03:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
um well we had
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
we have an issue uh
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a small it's a small train
 
03:30:47.570 --> 03:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
station in the middle of the UNH campus
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
and the you know UNH uses a lot but it's
 
03:30:50.040 --> 03:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
and the you know UNH uses a lot but it's
uh

03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:30:54.290 --> 03:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
there is a town-owned property which is
 
03:30:56.090 --> 03:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
now actually originally they didn't
 
03:30:57.650 --> 03:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
didn't really do a very good job of
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
serving the commuters on the train
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
they've since realized that's a problem
 
03:31:02.990 --> 03:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a town
 
03:31:05.389 --> 03:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
Town parking lot which is serves the
 
03:31:07.370 --> 03:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
commuters who can earn many communities
 
03:31:08.809 --> 03:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
just drive there and park in the town
 
03:31:11.450 --> 03:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
parking lot there is also uh public
 
03:31:13.610 --> 03:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
transit that serves the train station
 
03:31:15.769 --> 03:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
and there's you know there's plans
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's plans uh I think there's plans
 
03:31:19.969 --> 03:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
afoot to uh do more development there by
 
03:31:22.010 --> 03:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
the Whittemore Center so it's a it's a
 
03:31:23.389 --> 03:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
long process to do that thing and
 
03:31:24.889 --> 03:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
there's some bureaucratic things so I
 
03:31:26.210 --> 03:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
mean it's uh
 
03:31:28.429 --> 03:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
you know we are thinking like a lot
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
farther ahead than we usually do but you
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
know and even what's there it's been
 
03:31:33.710 --> 03:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
very successful there's a lot of writers
 
03:31:35.690 --> 03:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
and there is at least a
 
03:31:37.849 --> 03:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
one successful business operating at the
 
03:31:39.769 --> 03:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
train station and I'm I mean I
 
03:31:41.929 --> 03:31:41.939 align:start position:0%
personally if it's possible we'd like to
 
03:31:44.330 --> 03:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
see some more if so thank you thank you
 
03:31:45.889 --> 03:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
03:31:48.170 --> 03:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd thank you uh are
 
03:31:49.490 --> 03:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
there any further questions for
 
03:31:51.530 --> 03:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Harrigan seeing none
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:00.410 --> 03:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call uh Drew Claire in
 
03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
03:32:02.220 --> 03:32:04.429 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
please

03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:32:06.769 --> 03:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
a correction Mr chairman it's Klein c l
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.809 --> 03:32:16.819 align:start position:0%
well that was uh I have a problem
 
03:32:19.729 --> 03:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
enunciating and handwriting would be
 
03:32:23.530 --> 03:32:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.510 --> 03:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Drew Klein I'm president of
 
03:32:27.710 --> 03:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
the just higher Bartlett Center for
 
03:32:29.929 --> 03:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
Public Policy uh we are a free market
 
03:32:31.729 --> 03:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
Think Tank not a Libertarian think tank
 
03:32:34.849 --> 03:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
for the record uh there is a difference
 
03:32:36.530 --> 03:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
um I will try to be brief a lot of our
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
work has already been covered in
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
testimonies I won't go over that thank
 
03:32:41.330 --> 03:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
you it'd be appreciated we have some new
 
03:32:43.729 --> 03:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
stuff so uh commuter rail I think might
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
make sense in New Hampshire
 
03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
um just not in 2023 or any time this
 
03:32:51.290 --> 03:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
Century or The Next Century
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't make sense now for basic
 
03:32:55.250 --> 03:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
math reasons
 
03:32:55.260 --> 03:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
math reasons
um

03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
the general rule for light rail commuter
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
rail is that cities need population
 
03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
density of about 10 000 people per
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
square foot this is what you find in the
 
03:33:09.889 --> 03:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
academic studies and the textbooks Etc
 
03:33:12.469 --> 03:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
to make rail work
 
03:33:15.290 --> 03:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
Manchester's population density is per
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
the latest U.S census
 
03:33:21.050 --> 03:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
3496 people per square mile I'm sorry 10
 
03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
000 people per square mile not square
 
03:33:25.729 --> 03:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
foot sorry about that slip there that
 
03:33:27.769 --> 03:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
would be a real feat
 
03:33:27.779 --> 03:33:28.490 align:start position:0%
would be a real feat
um

03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
so 3496 people per square mile in
 
03:33:34.490 --> 03:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester Manchester does not have a
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
single zip code
 
03:33:40.610 --> 03:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
with even 4 000 people per square mile
 
03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
if rail enthusiasts hoped the city to
 
03:33:44.269 --> 03:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
grow into a rail friendly city they're
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to be waiting a very very very
 
03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
long time U.S censor data put
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester's population density at 3 310
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
per square mile in 2010
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
so the city's density has grown by just
 
03:33:59.809 --> 03:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
186 people per square mile in the last
 
03:33:59.819 --> 03:34:01.070 align:start position:0%
186 people per square mile in the last
decade

03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
decade
 
03:34:03.110 --> 03:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
at that rate
 
03:34:05.330 --> 03:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
reaching 10 000 people per square mile
 
03:34:09.889 --> 03:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
if the city's growth rate somehow
 
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
quickly doubled
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
we'd still be waiting 125 years to get
 
03:34:20.570 --> 03:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:24.610 --> 03:34:24.620 align:start position:0%
nashua's population density is much less
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
2961.7 people per square mile now there
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be this assumption you hear
 
03:34:31.130 --> 03:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
this over the years when it comes to
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
rail that Nashua Manchester and Lowell
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts are relatively close in
 
03:34:38.269 --> 03:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
population therefore it makes sense to
 
03:34:39.769 --> 03:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
have that Commuter Rail Line come to
 
03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
Nashua and then the Manchester from
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
Lowell but there's a huge difference so
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
Nashville is about 91 000 people Lowell
 
03:34:49.130 --> 03:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
and Manchester are both give or take you
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
know roughly 115 000 people
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
but Lowell's population density
 
03:34:55.319 --> 03:34:56.769 align:start position:0%
but Lowell's population density
is

03:34:56.769 --> 03:34:56.779 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
8489.8 people per square mile
 
03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
it is well over double Manchester's
 
03:35:05.570 --> 03:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's a huge difference the reason we
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
don't already have commuter rail from
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
Lowell to Nashua uh Manchester is
 
03:35:10.610 --> 03:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
because it economically does not make
 
03:35:10.620 --> 03:35:11.410 align:start position:0%
because it economically does not make
sense

03:35:11.410 --> 03:35:11.420 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot of other research on
 
03:35:15.650 --> 03:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
this in the past
 
03:35:17.450 --> 03:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
I will just leave you with some more
 
03:35:21.050 --> 03:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
recent data on commuting patterns and
 
03:35:21.060 --> 03:35:23.090 align:start position:0%
recent data on commuting patterns and
railridership

03:35:23.090 --> 03:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
railridership
 
03:35:23.100 --> 03:35:24.110 align:start position:0%
railridership
um

03:35:24.110 --> 03:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic just last month or
 
03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
last week rather axios reported that the
 
03:35:32.690 --> 03:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
U.S office vacancy rate has reached a
 
03:35:35.090 --> 03:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
new post-pandemic high
 
03:35:37.610 --> 03:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
of 50 percent
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
Boston's commercial vacancy rate
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
is about 15 percent that's the highest
 
03:35:52.490 --> 03:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's been since the.com bust it's office
 
03:35:54.889 --> 03:35:54.899 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now is about 17
 
03:35:54.899 --> 03:35:56.450 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now is about 17
percent

03:35:56.450 --> 03:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:35:58.490 --> 03:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
so representative Leon was absolutely
 
03:35:58.500 --> 03:36:00.050 align:start position:0%
so representative Leon was absolutely
correct

03:36:00.050 --> 03:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:36:02.090 --> 03:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
our commuting patterns our work patterns
 
03:36:04.130 --> 03:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
are changing
 
03:36:05.929 --> 03:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
people are leaving
 
03:36:08.210 --> 03:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
the center cities they're hollowing out
 
03:36:11.570 --> 03:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
right now people aren't coming back
 
03:36:14.570 --> 03:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
um they're not filling that in and
 
03:36:19.150 --> 03:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
building a point-to-point rail line
 
03:36:21.290 --> 03:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
as if
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
the old working commuting patterns still
 
03:36:27.290 --> 03:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
existed uh would be a financial mistake
 
03:36:30.170 --> 03:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
so um railrider ship commuter rail
 
03:36:33.050 --> 03:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
ridership in Boston is only now back to
 
03:36:35.690 --> 03:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
about 75 76 percent of what it was
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
before pandemic so even in Boston their
 
03:36:41.450 --> 03:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
commuter rail is not back to speed
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
the MBTA who has been pegged by the dot
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
to run our Commuter Rail Line
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
gets 91 percent of its operating revenue
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
from subsidies only nine percent of it
 
03:36:54.410 --> 03:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.410 --> 03:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
and this is in a city with a density of
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
about just under 14 000 people per
 
03:37:01.969 --> 03:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
square mile
 
03:37:05.330 --> 03:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
if anyone thinks that that ratio is
 
03:37:08.030 --> 03:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to improve with a rail line to a
 
03:37:11.330 --> 03:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
city that has density of less than 4 000
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
people per square mile
 
03:37:15.050 --> 03:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I think they're a mistake so I'm
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
going to leave you with that data
 
03:37:18.410 --> 03:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
um if there any questions happen to take
 
03:37:20.990 --> 03:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
them otherwise I'll take off thank you
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Klein are there questions from the
 
03:37:25.010 --> 03:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.690 --> 03:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to recognize uh
 
03:37:34.849 --> 03:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
03:37:37.550 --> 03:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh to speak next
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
um representative I think there's a
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
mistake on your card it says you're only
 
03:37:43.790 --> 03:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
going to speak two minutes
 
03:37:46.250 --> 03:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
knowing you for knowing you for a long
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
time could you could you could you
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
please try and figure something thank
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman evidently you know I did
 
03:37:54.889 --> 03:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
kiss a blondie Stone before I left the
 
03:37:57.830 --> 03:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
outside yes that's my point go ahead
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative I I will try as I used to
 
03:38:03.530 --> 03:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
tell sister raspisha to be on my best
 
03:38:03.540 --> 03:38:05.450 align:start position:0%
tell sister raspisha to be on my best
behavior

03:38:05.450 --> 03:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
03:38:05.460 --> 03:38:06.769 align:start position:0%
behavior
uh

03:38:06.769 --> 03:38:06.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:09.170 --> 03:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
committee members of my representative
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
Mike O'Brien are represent district 10
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
which is the city of Nashua uh the other
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
hat that I wear I'm also vice president
 
03:38:21.050 --> 03:38:21.060 align:start position:0%

03:38:21.060 --> 03:38:22.190 align:start position:0%
of the board of alderman for the city of
Nashua

03:38:22.190 --> 03:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:23.630 align:start position:0%
Nashua
uh

03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
this is the most prejudicial thing I
 
03:38:28.849 --> 03:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
ever saw come down the pike
 
03:38:31.670 --> 03:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
in my life
 
03:38:34.250 --> 03:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
this is earmarked for one place and one
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
place only Manchester and Nashua
 
03:38:41.030 --> 03:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is terrible this should be wrapped
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
up and thrown away into the basket in my
 
03:38:46.190 --> 03:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
personal opinion but let me stay just
 
03:38:49.490 --> 03:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
strictly on the bill but
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
if I look at line three of the bill down
 
03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
to line seven
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
it says you you know this committee
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to develop
 
03:39:01.490 --> 03:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
trans you know futuristic Transportation
 
03:39:04.250 --> 03:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
needs for the state but then the new
 
03:39:06.410 --> 03:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
language that came in but here's the
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
so it to me it's very highly confusing
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing is look at the new
 
03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
additions from line seven to line 10.
 
03:39:23.570 --> 03:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
that no state funds will go into any
 
03:39:26.229 --> 03:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
rail projects
 
03:39:28.969 --> 03:39:28.979 align:start position:0%
including the project and like I say
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
laser focus
 
03:39:33.469 --> 03:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
direct attack this is not a dumb bomb
 
03:39:36.010 --> 03:39:36.020 align:start position:0%
this is a smart bomb coming right down
 
03:39:39.110 --> 03:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
for the project named Nashua Manchester
 
03:39:42.889 --> 03:39:42.899 align:start position:0%
conquet but does it also affect what's
 
03:39:44.870 --> 03:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
happening to rail Corridor out in
 
03:39:44.880 --> 03:39:46.490 align:start position:0%
happening to rail Corridor out in
Seacoast

03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
Seacoast
 
03:39:49.250 --> 03:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
have you asked that question what is the
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
ill effect of that
 
03:39:53.210 --> 03:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
it might
 
03:39:56.210 --> 03:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
so again this is a bad Bill based upon
 
03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
that now I hear others say oh geez you
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
know Nashua Here Comes Nashua I know how
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
you feel his Manchester Nashua again
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
but then again let's look at your own
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
communities how many you got Keno Nashua
 
03:40:13.729 --> 03:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
has Keno but in some communities in the
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
state you know one representative to say
 
03:40:19.250 --> 03:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
well what do my community get well you
 
03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
get a lot out of Nashua
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
because all that money that went from
 
03:40:26.929 --> 03:40:26.939 align:start position:0%
keno and the lottery and everything goes
 
03:40:28.849 --> 03:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
into the to state fund and funds
 
03:40:31.370 --> 03:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
education even to communities that don't
 
03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
contribute or have Keno
 
03:40:35.690 --> 03:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
in the community you get a lot out of
 
03:40:35.700 --> 03:40:36.710 align:start position:0%
in the community you get a lot out of
Nashua

03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:38.929 align:start position:0%
Nashua
business-wise

03:40:38.929 --> 03:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
business-wise
 
03:40:43.729 --> 03:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
uh 1.1 billion dollars is raised and
 
03:40:47.450 --> 03:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
taxed by the state in Nashua uh in jobs
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
from BAE Systems
 
03:40:52.849 --> 03:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
does that not benefit the state of New
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's what you get from
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
Nashua you want to laugh at 1.1 billion
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
dollars I'm not
 
03:41:01.250 --> 03:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
and then again if we build this railroad
 
03:41:04.490 --> 03:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
is this increasing jobs particularly
 
03:41:08.450 --> 03:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
jobs in in the uh in the technical field
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
are you guys against jobs is the
 
03:41:12.530 --> 03:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative that put this bill in
 
03:41:15.170 --> 03:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
against jobs this is putting people to
 
03:41:15.180 --> 03:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
against jobs this is putting people to
work

03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
I also want to remind this committee
 
03:41:24.050 --> 03:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
that what do I get out of Nashua what do
 
03:41:25.969 --> 03:41:25.979 align:start position:0%
I get out of Manchester
 
03:41:28.130 --> 03:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
well I'll tell you another thing 35
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the state economy is
 
03:41:32.929 --> 03:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
generated out of Nashua Manchester
 
03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
General area
 
03:41:36.889 --> 03:41:36.899 align:start position:0%
that's a lot
 
03:41:39.050 --> 03:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
that's more than anybody else in the
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
whole state and yet to sit here and see
 
03:41:43.610 --> 03:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
something laser focused like this
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
to try to come down to the communities
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
of Nashua or Manchester and stop us from
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing our due diligence of trying to
 
03:41:54.170 --> 03:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
make this state one of the best states
 
03:41:56.809 --> 03:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
to live in the Union
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
how can we do this can we do it alone no
 
03:42:01.790 --> 03:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
municipality can will we need a little
 
03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
assistance from the state the answer is
 
03:42:05.809 --> 03:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
yes well we need some assistance from
 
03:42:08.690 --> 03:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
federal funding the answer is yes but
 
03:42:11.330 --> 03:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
let's look at the census this year's
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
sentences National increase to a
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
population of ninety one thousand one
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty four people it's an
 
03:42:19.190 --> 03:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
increase from the last time they did
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
this census
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
in my opinion probably by the next
 
03:42:26.929 --> 03:42:26.939 align:start position:0%
census Nashua may be a new number one
 
03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
city in New Hampshire
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
we're growing we increase our density
 
03:42:34.190 --> 03:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing all right look at the
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
business model for the city of Nashua
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
and you tell me if we're doing a bad job
 
03:42:43.250 --> 03:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
and what's going to go hand and glove
 
03:42:47.410 --> 03:42:47.420 align:start position:0%
with this is this commuter rail process
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
this opens up the door you take what I
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned Bae what do you think Bae gets
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
a bae gets a lot of their people MIT
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
have it
 
03:42:59.330 --> 03:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
if you're right on the link down in
 
03:43:01.010 --> 03:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
Boston they can jump on the train and
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
come right up into Nashua unless also
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
too and why am I telling you your
 
03:43:06.889 --> 03:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
business but I do know your business
 
03:43:09.650 --> 03:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
because I used to say senator O'Brien
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
could you suspend a moment yes please
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes I always enjoy your conversation oh
 
03:43:15.490 --> 03:43:15.500 align:start position:0%
you sure
 
03:43:18.650 --> 03:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
we have we have another hearing at one
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock well if I may make one point and
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
I will do it I don't mean to say what I
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
was getting to uh Mr chair and thank you
 
03:43:28.130 --> 03:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
for allowing
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
this has got to be taken into
 
03:43:32.630 --> 03:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
consideration you have public works and
 
03:43:35.450 --> 03:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
Highway you know rule three the Everett
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
Turnpike is built out
 
03:43:40.849 --> 03:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
it's not going to expand
 
03:43:42.290 --> 03:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
03:43:44.990 --> 03:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
next time you do a project like that you
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
get into imminent domain if y'all like
 
03:43:50.870 --> 03:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
me you hate imminent domain
 
03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
so how can we alleviate the future
 
03:43:56.090 --> 03:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
traffic with an increase in population
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
to Future traffic to make New Hampshire
 
03:44:02.570 --> 03:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
citizens viable in a different Market
 
03:44:05.570 --> 03:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
the Boston Market for the money that
 
03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
they'll make down there will bring up
 
03:44:11.150 --> 03:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what's going to help out the
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
General New Hampshire economy thank you
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%

03:44:30.170 --> 03:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
to that you are vice president of the
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%

um thank you for your service can it was
 
03:44:36.530 --> 03:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
very easy to do just run for an election
 
03:44:36.540 --> 03:44:39.530 align:start position:0%
very easy to do just run for an election
[Laughter]

03:44:39.530 --> 03:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:44:41.870 --> 03:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
say I hear you same here
 
03:44:44.030 --> 03:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
um how much has the city of Nashua
 
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
allocated in its budget in terms of
 
03:44:48.889 --> 03:44:48.899 align:start position:0%
strategically planning for the prospects
 
03:44:50.929 --> 03:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
of rail coming to Nashua quite a lot
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
actually and thank you for the question
 
03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
Nashua has looked at purchasing and has
 
03:44:55.859 --> 03:44:57.010 align:start position:0%
Nashua has looked at purchasing and has
purchased

03:44:57.010 --> 03:44:57.020 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
03:45:00.769 --> 03:45:00.779 align:start position:0%
two potential Rail stations in
 
03:45:03.229 --> 03:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
anticipation for it for it to come in
 
03:45:04.969 --> 03:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
that would not be affected by the state
 
03:45:07.969 --> 03:45:07.979 align:start position:0%
money but Nashua has looked at that in
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
the Crown Hill section it will
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
rejuvenate that particular neighborhood
 
03:45:14.690 --> 03:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
and then also in the South End so things
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
are very much Nashua also has appointed
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
by the several Mayors and still in
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
existence the national rail commission

like I say in the Crown Hill
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%

you thank you chairman
 
03:47:33.650 --> 03:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
currently do you think that there are uh
 
03:47:36.170 --> 03:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
in in current Commuter Rail stations uh
 
03:47:38.750 --> 03:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
North Billerica Wilmington and Lowell
 
03:47:40.849 --> 03:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
Mass are their cars and those densities
 
03:47:42.670 --> 03:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
that we've talked a lot about densities
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh are there vehicles uh their residents
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
from other towns or cities going into
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
places like Lowell North America
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
Wilmington to get onto the commuter
 
03:47:54.769 --> 03:47:54.779 align:start position:0%
rails to go south into into Boston or
 
03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
possibly North into into New Hampshire
 
03:47:59.809 --> 03:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
National and Manchester well from what
 
03:48:01.969 --> 03:48:01.979 align:start position:0%
you described if you go down off of 128
 
03:48:03.769 --> 03:48:03.779 align:start position:0%
and look at the brand new garage that
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
was built on University Ave and that's a
 
03:48:09.710 --> 03:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
short hop and Skip right into Boston but
 
03:48:11.870 --> 03:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's more economical for people to do
 
03:48:14.450 --> 03:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
that than to pay the X amount Boston
 
03:48:17.570 --> 03:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
type of uh payment to get a parking
 
03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
space and everything so this is like a
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
lot of the benefits of the commuter rail
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
system so yes the short answer is yes
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
but you can see it for in existence down
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
at the University Avenue Needham
 
03:48:34.190 --> 03:48:34.200 align:start position:0%

03:48:36.170 --> 03:48:36.180 align:start position:0%

members of the committee I appreciate
 
04:47:19.128 --> 04:47:19.138 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak here today for
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Greg Moore I am
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
the state director with Americans for
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
Prosperity New Hampshire here today to
 
04:47:27.050 --> 04:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill 110 and
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
I will say about house bill 110. I
 
04:47:31.490 --> 04:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
certainly heard a lot of testimony and I
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to be redundant one
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that I didn't hear was a
 
04:47:37.550 --> 04:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony about what is
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
specifically in the bill and what the
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
bill the bill bill is not a referendum
 
04:47:43.970 --> 04:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
on trains certainly we have Pat commuter
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
rail going through New Hampshire and the
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
and the down over and over running
 
04:47:51.410 --> 04:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
through Exeter Durham and Dover and
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's functioning just fine
 
04:47:56.208 --> 04:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
the question is is whether
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the state taxpayers will subsidize
 
04:48:01.010 --> 04:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
commuter rail going forward
 
04:48:03.770 --> 04:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
whether a small a small number of people
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
will benefit from uh the taxpay the
 
04:48:07.970 --> 04:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the entirety of New
 
04:48:10.250 --> 04:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our belief is that is that
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh that projects like that that require
 
04:48:15.890 --> 04:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
High degrees of subsidy and we don't
 
04:48:17.690 --> 04:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
exactly know obviously the Department of
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation will follow and can offer
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
more Guidance with the the
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
most recent study which presumably
 
04:48:27.890 --> 04:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
should be completed in the near term
 
04:48:29.930 --> 04:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
what exactly the amount of the subsidy
 
04:48:33.288 --> 04:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
is and at a time when you look at a you
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
look at the MBTA the data that an
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
earlier an earlier presenter mentioned
 
04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
that 91 percent of its costs are funded
 
04:48:43.250 --> 04:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
by subsidies and so the question then
 
04:48:45.650 --> 04:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
becomes what is appropriate as far as as
 
04:48:47.930 --> 04:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
far as subsidizing a small number of New
 
04:48:50.208 --> 04:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and maybe a small a
 
04:48:51.770 --> 04:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
small number of Massachusetts residents
 
04:48:53.628 --> 04:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
relative to the size of the of the state
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
as a whole and we believe it's it's it's
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
inappropriate the and the level of
 
04:49:01.550 --> 04:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
subsidy is unwarranted uh so from our
 
04:49:03.410 --> 04:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
perspective focusing exclusively on on
 
04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
the subsidies I think is the key for
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
this committee and I think it's it's
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
really the key just of this entire uh
 
04:49:12.770 --> 04:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
process certainly no issue if the cities
 
04:49:14.030 --> 04:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
of Manchester Nashville feel it's
 
04:49:17.208 --> 04:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
appropriate to subsidize as a train if
 
04:49:19.970 --> 04:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
there is a passenger rail service which
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
could charge to get all of the money
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
they need from the fares of that that is
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate but uh asking asking New
 
04:49:29.330 --> 04:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers to subsidize what's
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
only going to benefit a small number of
 
04:49:31.850 --> 04:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents we think it's
 
04:49:34.010 --> 04:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
bad policy so for that reason we're
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
opposed to I mean we support the
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislation we we oppose subsidies and
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:49:42.770 --> 04:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions for Mr Moore yes
 
04:49:42.780 --> 04:49:45.230 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions for Mr Moore yes
please

04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you tell me any
 
04:49:50.150 --> 04:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
passenger rail service that doesn't
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
operate without subsidies
 
04:49:54.650 --> 04:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
I I it's it thank you for the question
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any commuter-based rail
 
04:49:59.570 --> 04:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
services that operate without subsidies
 
04:50:03.430 --> 04:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
at this point uh the the there was an a
 
04:50:06.770 --> 04:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
about four years ago I remember I think
 
04:50:08.330 --> 04:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
it was four years ago there was an
 
04:50:10.250 --> 04:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
effort put forth by a businessman from
 
04:50:12.890 --> 04:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to actually uh actually
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
bring passenger rail service up through
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
Concord and Manchester privately meaning
 
04:50:21.170 --> 04:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
no no taxpayer subsidies I'm not sure
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
how that model would work frankly I was
 
04:50:25.850 --> 04:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
a little skeptical my understanding is
 
04:50:28.128 --> 04:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
that his his company is has gone by the
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
wayside so that's no longer a viable
 
04:50:32.090 --> 04:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
project but at least one person did view
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
this as as what as a viable alternative
 
04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he had plans for federal
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
subsidies I assume he did because it's
 
04:50:40.850 --> 04:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
just a capital upgrades in the tracks
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
would be prohibitively expensive for an
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
individual or a company to to pay for
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
but he had a plan to bring it up uh it
 
04:50:49.850 --> 04:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
was fairly notable when it was when it
 
04:50:52.610 --> 04:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
was rolled out uh and that was I think
 
04:50:52.620 --> 04:50:53.770 align:start position:0%
was rolled out uh and that was I think
think

04:50:53.770 --> 04:50:53.780 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:50:58.128 --> 04:50:58.138 align:start position:0%
2018 I believe was 2018. so it's not
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of possibility
 
04:51:03.770 --> 04:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
for other questions for Mr Moore
 
04:51:07.128 --> 04:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
if you could indulge me one or in your
 
04:51:09.530 --> 04:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
research are you aware of a passenger
 
04:51:12.410 --> 04:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
line that operates without subsidy or at
 
04:51:14.090 --> 04:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
a profit
 
04:51:20.288 --> 04:51:20.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
my question is to
 
04:51:27.770 --> 04:51:27.780 align:start position:0%

um good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
Megan Karen and I'm here to read a
 
04:52:16.250 --> 04:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
statement on behalf of Mayor Jim donkess
 
04:52:19.010 --> 04:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
of Nashua who regretfully could not be
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
as the mayor of the city of Nashua I am
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
writing to you to express my strong
 
04:52:27.288 --> 04:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 110. this bills
 
04:52:29.448 --> 04:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
aim to prohibit the use of State funds
 
04:52:31.490 --> 04:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
for new passenger rail projects is
 
04:52:33.410 --> 04:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
short-sighted and has direct negative
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
impacts on Nashua
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
despite the executive council's recent
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
decision to Halt the nhdot's feasibility
 
04:52:44.090 --> 04:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
study at 72 percent completion
 
04:52:46.128 --> 04:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
I remain committed to ensuring that our
 
04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
state's decision makers and citizens are
 
04:52:49.850 --> 04:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
provided with the necessary information
 
04:52:52.610 --> 04:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the role that rail will have
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
will play in our future growth
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
prosperity and Community Development
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
this legislation specifically names the
 
04:53:04.490 --> 04:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
national Manchester Concord rail line as
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
a as a project that would be excluded
 
04:53:08.570 --> 04:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
from being funded if this legislation
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
passes this is despite the fact that
 
04:53:13.730 --> 04:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
this project is identified in the
 
04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
current 10-year Transportation
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
the state has already recognized the
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
importance of this project by including
 
04:53:22.368 --> 04:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
it in its long-term Transportation
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
Planning and partially completing a
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
feasibility study but passage of this
 
04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill would hinder our ability to work
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
collaboratively collaboratively with the
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
state to explore the future of rail in
 
04:53:34.430 --> 04:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:53:36.650 --> 04:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
passenger rail is a transformative
 
04:53:38.330 --> 04:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity for New Hampshire's future
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
growth and development
 
04:53:42.170 --> 04:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
connecting our state with the Greater
 
04:53:44.930 --> 04:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
Boston area opens up a wide array of
 
04:53:46.610 --> 04:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
economic opportunities for New Hampshire
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
businesses to attract new workers and
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
customers reduce the emission of
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases by taking cars off the
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
road and increases Transportation Equity
 
04:53:58.010 --> 04:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
by opening opportunities for people
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
without cars to access the educational
 
04:54:04.250 --> 04:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
medical and cultural resources of Boston
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
these benefits will not only be seen by
 
04:54:09.288 --> 04:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
Nashua or Manchester but all of Southern
 
04:54:10.610 --> 04:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
passenger Rail stations in Nashville
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
will be connected to the Nashua transit
 
04:54:16.910 --> 04:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
system which serves and connects with
 
04:54:19.490 --> 04:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
riders and surrounding communities
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
the services are critical to our
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
communities most vulnerable populations
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
the train will be an important piece in
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
creating an accessible multimodal
 
04:54:31.010 --> 04:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
Transit Network across Southern New
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that connects people with the
 
04:54:35.330 --> 04:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
places they need and want to go
 
04:54:37.310 --> 04:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
I would urge the committee to give this
 
04:54:40.070 --> 04:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill a recommendation of inexpedient to
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislate the state has already
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
identified this project as a priority by
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
including it in its 10-year
 
04:54:48.530 --> 04:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan and perhaps most
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
importantly our communities want
 
04:54:52.730 --> 04:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
passenger rail in the access and
 
04:54:55.010 --> 04:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
opportunities that come with it thank
 
04:54:56.690 --> 04:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
you for your consideration
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and for uh
 
04:55:02.810 --> 04:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
city of Nashua sending that along are
 
04:55:05.930 --> 04:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh I'm
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
sorry is there a question yes

miss Karen thank you for representing
 
04:55:19.250 --> 04:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
the mayor of Nashua very quickly I asked
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien uh previously how
 
04:55:24.110 --> 04:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
much money had the city of Nashua
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
allocated in preparation and I'm going
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
to ask you that same question again
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question so
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh the exact figure I can get to you but
 
04:55:38.050 --> 04:55:38.060 align:start position:0%
I will say that the New Hampshire D.O.T
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
when asked if uh the mayor could
 
04:55:41.760 --> 04:55:43.190 align:start position:0%
when asked if uh the mayor could
contribute

04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
um uh any any money he uh did say he
 
04:55:49.680 --> 04:55:50.570 align:start position:0%
um uh any any money he uh did say he
could

04:55:50.570 --> 04:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
um or he's confident that the the board
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
of aldermen would support uh a little
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:59.510 --> 04:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
04:55:59.520 --> 04:56:00.948 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
chairman

04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:56:04.850 --> 04:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:07.368 --> 04:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
I'd like to bring forward uh Andrea
 
04:56:10.490 --> 04:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
brayer from New Hampshire dot please who
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:20.930 --> 04:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:56:22.550 --> 04:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee it's been fun to spend the day
 
04:56:23.448 --> 04:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
with you
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
again for the record Andre Briere Deputy
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioner with me is uh Miss Shelley
 
04:56:30.890 --> 04:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
Winters who's our director of Aviation
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit
 
04:56:34.670 --> 04:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh just for brief place setting remarks
 
04:56:36.650 --> 04:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
I'll tell uh tell you for the record
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire D.O.T neither
 
04:56:40.610 --> 04:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
supports nor opposes any particular mode
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
of transportation
 
04:56:45.470 --> 04:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
to include passenger rail we design
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
build and maintain all modes that are uh
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
that are directed for us to uh to design
 
04:56:56.090 --> 04:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
build and maintain by The People's
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
elected representatives so we came into
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
this project starting in 2019 with a
 
04:57:02.990 --> 04:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
task that was given to us by this body
 
04:57:05.208 --> 04:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
and that was to take this through the
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary design phase approximately
 
04:57:10.490 --> 04:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
the 30 design phase and therefore to
 
04:57:12.050 --> 04:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
come up with a realistic financial plan
 
04:57:13.850 --> 04:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
that's what we've done
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh that project and I guess in direct uh
 
04:57:19.250 --> 04:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
response to the to the sponsor who
 
04:57:21.230 --> 04:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill just for clarity
 
04:57:24.650 --> 04:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
that project closed out on the 31st of
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
January that's when we were given the
 
04:57:29.930 --> 04:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
initial drafts uh by the consultant
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
so as you can imagine we have to then QC
 
04:57:35.930 --> 04:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
those drafts uh make sure that they are
 
04:57:39.770 --> 04:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
sufficient in substance uh and then uh
 
04:57:41.390 --> 04:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
when we're satisfied that those are
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
complete and correct we will make those
 
04:57:45.288 --> 04:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
publicly available and also provide
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
those to the legislature so that's where
 
04:57:50.570 --> 04:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
we are as far as this project goes
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
our opposition really is technical and
 
04:57:56.810 --> 04:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
that goes to the uh the wording
 
04:57:59.930 --> 04:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
of the bill itself as written the title
 
04:58:02.270 --> 04:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
stipulates that it prohibits the use of
 
04:58:04.010 --> 04:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
State funds for new passenger rail
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
projects the body of the legislation
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
though uh does not make that distinction
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
and I quote no state fund shall be
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate or expended for the planning
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
construction operation or management of
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
Passenger rail projects it does not say
 
04:58:18.360 --> 04:58:19.430 align:start position:0%
Passenger rail projects it does not say
new

04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
we interpret this to mean that we would
 
04:58:25.128 --> 04:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
be prohibited from any sort of State
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
funding for maintenance or indeed the
 
04:58:30.770 --> 04:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
the time of the State Workforce
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
um to dedicate ourselves to any project
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
associated with the Downeaster or any
 
04:58:37.550 --> 04:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
similar passenger rail it also doesn't
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
Define what passenger rail is in this
 
04:58:41.570 --> 04:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
context which could be interpreted as
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
also meaning tourist rail to include the
 
04:58:45.890 --> 04:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
Cog railroad which operates on our lines
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
so our our primary objections are
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
technical again we are not either havocs
 
04:58:52.430 --> 04:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
or opponents of the capital Corridor
 
04:58:54.590 --> 04:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
project itself we were given a task and
 
04:58:56.270 --> 04:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
we accomplished that task
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
so with that I would defer to the
 
04:59:00.288 --> 04:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
committee for any questions thank you
 
04:59:04.850 --> 04:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.860 --> 04:59:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:07.200 --> 04:59:09.230 align:start position:0%
yes
Reservoir

04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
Reservoir
 
04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman just a
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
real quick one do you have an ETA on
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
when that report would be ready
 
04:59:19.850 --> 04:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
yes sir we're in the midst of editing it
 
04:59:22.368 --> 04:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
ourselves uh so again we were provided
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
the uh the final consultant drafts late
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
night on the 31st this week
 
04:59:31.368 --> 04:59:31.378 align:start position:0%
so we are currently in conversations uh
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
both uh Miss Winters and I have gone
 
04:59:35.330 --> 04:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
back and forth on several drafts
 
04:59:38.090 --> 04:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
ultimately the the commissioner of dot
 
04:59:40.730 --> 04:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
will have to approve those
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't speculate a guess I would
 
04:59:45.288 --> 04:59:45.298 align:start position:0%
say it's it's a matter of uh weeks not
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
months so it will be not too long
 
04:59:51.288 --> 04:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:59:51.298 --> 04:59:52.610 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
yes

04:59:52.610 --> 04:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Deputy
 
04:59:55.610 --> 04:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioner thank you for your
 
04:59:58.850 --> 04:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
testimony just one um two two first
 
05:00:02.330 --> 05:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
question the technical line seven the
 
05:00:03.948 --> 05:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
where it says no State funds you're
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
saying you should put if if it read no
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
new state funds
 
05:00:11.448 --> 05:00:11.458 align:start position:0%
or uh alternatively
 
05:00:11.458 --> 05:00:12.170 align:start position:0%
or uh alternatively
um

05:00:12.170 --> 05:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:15.050 --> 05:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
on line eight or nine if it were to say
 
05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
new passenger rail projects in other
 
05:00:19.368 --> 05:00:19.378 align:start position:0%
words match the title of the legislation
 
05:00:22.190 --> 05:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
that would be correct in in as far as
 
05:00:23.868 --> 05:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
we're concerned it would allow us the
 
05:00:26.690 --> 05:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
latitude to continue to expend time and
 
05:00:29.930 --> 05:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
funds on existing passenger rail service
 
05:00:31.850 --> 05:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
uh second follow-up follow-up thank you
 
05:00:34.190 --> 05:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Deputy Commissioner back
 
05:00:34.200 --> 05:00:36.530 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Deputy Commissioner back
in

05:00:36.530 --> 05:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:00:39.170 --> 05:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
I want to say it was
 
05:00:41.570 --> 05:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
fall of 2020 my dates could be wrong but
 
05:00:43.368 --> 05:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
there was a rollout it was assumed
 
05:00:45.170 --> 05:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
meeting where they introduced the
 
05:00:46.850 --> 05:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
capital Corridor project they was
 
05:00:49.730 --> 05:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
basically high level talked about the
 
05:00:51.350 --> 05:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
length of the line Economic Development
 
05:00:54.050 --> 05:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
opportunities it's a lot of data that
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
was included and I wasn't looking for it
 
05:00:58.610 --> 05:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
today and I I have it somewhere but my
 
05:01:00.170 --> 05:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
question to you is this report that's
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
being going to be propagating in the
 
05:01:03.170 --> 05:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
next couple of weeks it's not going to
 
05:01:05.150 --> 05:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
have any impact on the data that was
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
communicated to us three years ago in
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
other words it's the data potentially
 
05:01:10.970 --> 05:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
going to be changing in One Direction or
 
05:01:12.590 --> 05:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
the other or do you see that being
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
relatively static
 
05:01:17.208 --> 05:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
so I I can answer your question I guess
 
05:01:19.010 --> 05:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
at the kind of the 30 000 foot level
 
05:01:21.410 --> 05:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
which is we have continued to refine
 
05:01:24.288 --> 05:01:24.298 align:start position:0%
those numbers between that particular
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
meeting which I was also on I recall
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and today so the numbers are are much
 
05:01:32.690 --> 05:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
more refined much more fulsome uh
 
05:01:35.330 --> 05:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
factoring in everything that that we and
 
05:01:37.010 --> 05:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
the consultant team and the communities
 
05:01:38.810 --> 05:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
could come up with as far as actual
 
05:01:41.570 --> 05:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
costs in real terms
 
05:01:41.580 --> 05:01:43.430 align:start position:0%
costs in real terms
um

05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:45.050 --> 05:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
I will also say there's a number of
 
05:01:48.288 --> 05:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
assumptions that we've we've had to make
 
05:01:48.298 --> 05:01:49.970 align:start position:0%
assumptions that we've we've had to make
um

05:01:49.970 --> 05:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:52.730 --> 05:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
foremost of which is uh the
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
participation or not of the state of
 
05:01:54.958 --> 05:01:56.230 align:start position:0%
participation or not of the state of
Massachusetts

05:01:56.230 --> 05:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
we have no assurances we've consulted
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
obviously and uh coordinated but that
 
05:02:02.330 --> 05:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
was largely in the previous
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
administration the new Administration
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
South of the Border hasn't weighed in on
 
05:02:08.570 --> 05:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
this project so there's a lot of
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions that have to go into this in
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
the in the report that you will see in
 
05:02:14.330 --> 05:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
its final form we spell out we're very
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
clear about what is fact and what is
 
05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
assumption when it does come to costs
 
05:02:21.970 --> 05:02:21.980 align:start position:0%
and the overall burden that
 
05:02:24.650 --> 05:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
would come to the state of New Hampshire
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
If This Were pursued okay I appreciate
 
05:02:29.090 --> 05:02:29.100 align:start position:0%

05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%

members of the House Public Works and
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
highways committee my name is Wendy hunt
 
05:03:15.770 --> 05:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the president and CEO of the greater
 
05:03:17.930 --> 05:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
Nashua Chamber of Commerce our chamber
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
has consistently and strongly gone on
 
05:03:21.050 --> 05:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
record in support of the Capitol
 
05:03:22.850 --> 05:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
Corridor project and I'm here today to
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
emphasize our continued support for rail
 
05:03:26.570 --> 05:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
expansion of the Nashua Manchester
 
05:03:28.550 --> 05:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
Corridor in New Hampshire
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
the chamber represents over 400
 
05:03:32.570 --> 05:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
businesses across Southern New Hampshire
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
that employ thousands of our state's
 
05:03:36.050 --> 05:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
residents and generate over a billion
 
05:03:37.730 --> 05:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
dollars of economic activity each year
 
05:03:40.970 --> 05:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
the Nashua Manchester Corridor serves as
 
05:03:42.590 --> 05:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
the economic backbone of our entire
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
State as goes the economic output of our
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
region so goes the rest of New Hampshire
 
05:03:49.070 --> 05:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
therefore economic growth along the
 
05:03:51.410 --> 05:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
Nashua Manchester Corridor is important
 
05:03:52.970 --> 05:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
to the overall growth of our state's
 
05:03:52.980 --> 05:03:54.830 align:start position:0%
to the overall growth of our state's
economy

05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
economy
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Capital Corridor Rail
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
Project has the potential to have a
 
05:04:01.128 --> 05:04:01.138 align:start position:0%
transformative impact in on New
 
05:04:02.690 --> 05:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy by positively
 
05:04:05.390 --> 05:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
impacting the national Manchester
 
05:04:07.850 --> 05:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
Corridor we hear consistently from our
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
business members that they want rail
 
05:04:11.330 --> 05:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
expansion and that is vital to the
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
Southern Tier of the state I'm gonna I
 
05:04:13.920 --> 05:04:15.050 align:start position:0%
Southern Tier of the state I'm gonna I
have

05:04:15.050 --> 05:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
giving you all my testimony so I'm going
 
05:04:19.128 --> 05:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
to cut it short because of so many
 
05:04:21.170 --> 05:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
things that we agree with that have to
 
05:04:23.948 --> 05:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
do with the PDP and some other things
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
but but here is why um we feel the
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
capital Corridor project is so critical
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
first of all when we think of
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
cross-state employment we always think
 
05:04:35.930 --> 05:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents commuting
 
05:04:38.330 --> 05:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
into Boston for jobs and not vice versa
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack Valley Valley Massachusetts
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's a much higher unemployment rate
 
05:04:44.448 --> 05:04:44.458 align:start position:0%
than in New Hampshire greater now the
 
05:04:46.490 --> 05:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
greater Nashua area has thousands of
 
05:04:48.770 --> 05:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
unfilled jobs in manufacturing Health
 
05:04:50.570 --> 05:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
Care construction and other Industries
 
05:04:53.090 --> 05:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
rail expansion expansion into Southern
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from Massachusetts has the
 
05:04:56.208 --> 05:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
potential to bring thousands of daily
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
commuters each day into our state to
 
05:05:00.530 --> 05:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
fill these jobs
 
05:05:02.930 --> 05:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's population is aging
 
05:05:05.330 --> 05:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
population wise we are one of the oldest
 
05:05:07.850 --> 05:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
states in the country this means a
 
05:05:10.128 --> 05:05:10.138 align:start position:0%
smaller Workforce as workers retire and
 
05:05:11.930 --> 05:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
increase pressure as business look to
 
05:05:13.490 --> 05:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
hire and retain employees in the years
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
to come
 
05:05:18.170 --> 05:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
we need to attract younger employees to
 
05:05:20.090 --> 05:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
into our state or keep the ones we have
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
so our businesses and economy can
 
05:05:24.590 --> 05:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
continue to prosper and grow as we look
 
05:05:26.690 --> 05:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
at those younger employees we want to
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
attract public transportation is one of
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
the most important factors to them in
 
05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
fact people under 30 are far more likely
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
to ride public transportation and to
 
05:05:37.128 --> 05:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
express positive feelings than older
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
people regardless of what part of the
 
05:05:40.250 --> 05:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
country they live in
 
05:05:42.530 --> 05:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
open up opening up the possibility of
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
train travel from New Hampshire to other
 
05:05:45.948 --> 05:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
states in the Northeast and Beyond is
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
wildly attractive to this younger
 
05:05:47.280 --> 05:05:49.010 align:start position:0%
wildly attractive to this younger
demographic

05:05:49.010 --> 05:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
05:05:51.530 --> 05:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
finally on the New Hampshire Dot's Rail
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
and Transit page I've given attachments
 
05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
on all of the testimony thank you
 
05:05:59.150 --> 05:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
um it states quote the state is the
 
05:06:01.490 --> 05:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
largest railroad owner of over 200 miles
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
of active purchased line to preserve
 
05:06:06.530 --> 05:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
freight service industry or promote
 
05:06:08.930 --> 05:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
tourism and economic development so it
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
is part of of their job description
 
05:06:15.530 --> 05:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
um specifically why H why I want to talk
 
05:06:18.350 --> 05:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
about why HB 110 and we hope you find it
 
05:06:20.690 --> 05:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate
 
05:06:22.368 --> 05:06:22.378 align:start position:0%
um would would not only because the
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
study's not ready but um also as the
 
05:06:29.330 --> 05:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner said
 
05:06:31.250 --> 05:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
um the language is very confusing about
 
05:06:33.770 --> 05:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
new in the title and it's not mentioned
 
05:06:35.570 --> 05:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
in the body
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
um also I've attached um in the 2021
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment jobs act HB
 
05:06:43.368 --> 05:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
110 may be in violation of that as well
 
05:06:44.930 --> 05:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
as a federal passenger rail investment
 
05:06:47.330 --> 05:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
Improvement Act of 2008 and other DOT

um

05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
also it limits the ability of future
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislators to provide Pastor rail
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation as an option to the
 
05:06:58.490 --> 05:06:58.500 align:start position:0%

you to place me right after Wendy so I
 
05:07:42.770 --> 05:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
can Echo a lot of the points that she
 
05:07:45.230 --> 05:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
just said but I'd like to add a few of
 
05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
my own
 
05:07:49.850 --> 05:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
um as obviously CEO for the largest city
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it may seem that we
 
05:07:55.490 --> 05:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
have self-serving interest in this in in
 
05:07:57.110 --> 05:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill that I'd like you to
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
broaden your lens of Economic
 
05:08:01.970 --> 05:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
Development and I'm going to use one
 
05:08:04.128 --> 05:08:04.138 align:start position:0%
example to illustrate that economic
 
05:08:05.570 --> 05:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
development for our state goes far
 
05:08:08.208 --> 05:08:08.218 align:start position:0%
beyond zip codes and borders I'm sure
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with the Army
 
05:08:12.050 --> 05:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
project and the buildback better a
 
05:08:14.208 --> 05:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
regional challenge that we were able to
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
win through Dean cayman's work and
 
05:08:18.410 --> 05:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's really building a whole new
 
05:08:21.890 --> 05:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
industry for our entire state has the
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be the Silicon Valley of
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's biofabrication it's a
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
new industry and it is 44 million
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal funding that we
 
05:08:31.860 --> 05:08:32.990 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal funding that we
received

05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
received
 
05:08:36.530 --> 05:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
right now that's creating 7 000 jobs
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the future it will create tens of
 
05:08:40.970 --> 05:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
thousands of jobs I know you all know
 
05:08:43.368 --> 05:08:43.378 align:start position:0%
the the housing shortages and the
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
Staffing shortages that we are all
 
05:08:46.550 --> 05:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing especially in Manchester
 
05:08:48.530 --> 05:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
but throughout the whole state we need
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
places for these workers to be able to
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
live we need we need rail to be able to
 
05:08:54.590 --> 05:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
get them to and from to be able to
 
05:08:56.690 --> 05:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
support that kind of growth and I would
 
05:08:59.930 --> 05:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
argue that manufacturing and biofab are
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
two of the highest fastest growing
 
05:09:03.530 --> 05:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
industries that need this kind of
 
05:09:05.868 --> 05:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
support need to be able to bring you
 
05:09:07.850 --> 05:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
know people from MIT and Harvard yes but
 
05:09:10.490 --> 05:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
even from farther and it's giving a lot
 
05:09:12.288 --> 05:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
of national and international support
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
and putting New Hampshire on the map so
 
05:09:17.628 --> 05:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
just one illustration of many many
 
05:09:19.550 --> 05:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
examples that are that are just the same
 
05:09:21.770 --> 05:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
maybe not as large in scale but many
 
05:09:24.830 --> 05:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
many hundreds of examples so I'll leave
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
it there and uh I think that's that's
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
all we have time for I know you're
 
05:09:29.160 --> 05:09:30.230 align:start position:0%
all we have time for I know you're
fatigued

05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
fatigued
 
05:09:34.730 --> 05:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:36.650 --> 05:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh represent boy
 
05:09:38.270 --> 05:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony Mr mcgrail
 
05:09:42.490 --> 05:09:42.500 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong but the the
 
05:09:45.770 --> 05:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
Intermodal facility in Manchester that's
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's close correct is correct okay
 
05:09:50.448 --> 05:09:50.458 align:start position:0%
then my question you follow up Mrs
 
05:09:52.490 --> 05:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman so my
 
05:09:53.930 --> 05:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
question to you is how much of a
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
downtick in employment opportunities has
 
05:09:58.368 --> 05:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
occurred as a result of that bus station
 
05:10:01.850 --> 05:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
not providing a level of
 
05:10:04.368 --> 05:10:04.378 align:start position:0%
level of service to people that frequent
 
05:10:06.410 --> 05:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
downtown and work downtown Manchester I
 
05:10:08.570 --> 05:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
wish I had that exact stat I I thank you
 
05:10:10.490 --> 05:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
for the question but I don't know the
 
05:10:13.368 --> 05:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
exact stat of that I would imagine it's
 
05:10:14.810 --> 05:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
pretty significant
 
05:10:16.490 --> 05:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't want to speak out of turn
 
05:10:18.650 --> 05:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%

05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you so much

05:10:41.810 --> 05:10:41.820 align:start position:0%

expansion coalition
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
it's not often that you find an
 
05:11:24.170 --> 05:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
initiative that has support of 75
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire residents it's
 
05:11:28.850 --> 05:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
rare when support comes from majority of
 
05:11:31.850 --> 05:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
residents from every political party uh
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
every gender every age every education
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
level every ideology and in every County
 
05:11:38.270 --> 05:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
05:11:40.550 --> 05:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's even more rare when businesses both
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
large and small from coffee shops to
 
05:11:46.010 --> 05:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
construction companies from Banks to
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
biotech startups led by the staunchest
 
05:11:51.410 --> 05:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
of Republicans and most left-leaning
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
liberal Democrats all agree to support a
 
05:11:55.970 --> 05:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
specific project
 
05:11:58.490 --> 05:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
well that initiative is the expansion of
 
05:12:01.128 --> 05:12:01.138 align:start position:0%
Passenger rail from Boston to Nashua and
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester and those supporters are your
 
05:12:06.050 --> 05:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
neighbors families friends uh and your
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
constituents they support this
 
05:12:09.470 --> 05:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
initiative because of the overwhelming
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
Economic Development opportunity that it
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
would provide which would supercharge
 
05:12:14.930 --> 05:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's already booming economy
 
05:12:18.410 --> 05:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
I apologize no problem
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
for some reason my phone likes stance go
 
05:12:22.730 --> 05:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
ahead and I apologize
 
05:12:25.070 --> 05:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so the rail Expansion Project would
 
05:12:27.250 --> 05:12:27.260 align:start position:0%
result in thousands of jobs each year
 
05:12:29.690 --> 05:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
thousands of much needed residential
 
05:12:31.850 --> 05:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
units millions of square feet of
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate and hundreds of
 
05:12:34.970 --> 05:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in real estate
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
investment and reinvested worker
 
05:12:36.840 --> 05:12:37.850 align:start position:0%
investment and reinvested worker
earnings

05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
earnings
 
05:12:40.128 --> 05:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
uh currently the project development
 
05:12:42.650 --> 05:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
analysis is underway uh and that's
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
examining multiple aspects of the
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
project this is an in-depth analysis
 
05:12:49.010 --> 05:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
that will provide a solid environmental
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
engineering and financial uh picture to
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
give you all uh the necessary
 
05:12:57.288 --> 05:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
information to make an educated decision
 
05:13:00.170 --> 05:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
as written hb110 would eliminate all
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
prospects for investing in rail it would
 
05:13:04.730 --> 05:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
for the will of the overwhelming
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire citizens it
 
05:13:09.128 --> 05:13:09.138 align:start position:0%
would squander a once in a lifetime
 
05:13:11.628 --> 05:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
Economic Development opportunity for the
 
05:13:14.110 --> 05:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
state it's simply an unnecessary
 
05:13:16.490 --> 05:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
preemptive bill that's not ready for
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
prime time it presumes the state should
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
invest zero dollars in an infrastructure
 
05:13:23.810 --> 05:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
project before you have any data to make
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
an informed decision so I urge you on
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
behalf of 75 percent of New Hampshire
 
05:13:30.890 --> 05:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
residents over a hundred bipartisan
 
05:13:32.448 --> 05:13:32.458 align:start position:0%
businesses from across the state to
 
05:13:36.410 --> 05:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
reject HB 110. thank you thank you Mr

05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I came here today to speak in
 
05:14:44.448 --> 05:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to houseboat 110
 
05:14:47.090 --> 05:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
because new passenger rail is essential
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
to expanding Freedom reducing traffic
 
05:14:50.810 --> 05:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
and building a better future for our
 
05:14:50.820 --> 05:14:51.650 align:start position:0%
and building a better future for our
state

05:14:51.650 --> 05:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'd first like to talk about expanding
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
Freedom so building out our regional
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
passenger rail network will enable
 
05:15:00.350 --> 05:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
people to travel in more ways that suit
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
their needs giving the people giving the
 
05:15:04.430 --> 05:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
people of Manchester Nashua other
 
05:15:05.810 --> 05:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
communities in the surrounding area to
 
05:15:07.610 --> 05:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
you know the freedom to skip the traffic
 
05:15:10.610 --> 05:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
593 or the Fe Everett Turnpike if they
 
05:15:13.310 --> 05:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
so choose better access to work Leisure
 
05:15:15.070 --> 05:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
and other things like medical treatment
 
05:15:17.448 --> 05:15:17.458 align:start position:0%
Braille will give more people more
 
05:15:19.070 --> 05:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
personal choice in how they want to get
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
around as for traffic reduction I'm sure
 
05:15:23.090 --> 05:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
you've heard before but for every person
 
05:15:25.128 --> 05:15:25.138 align:start position:0%
who uses Regional Rail that's one less
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
car on our state roads and highways and
 
05:15:28.490 --> 05:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
as you know we have a lot of traffic
 
05:15:30.410 --> 05:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
that goes back and forth between New
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Massachusetts the roads
 
05:15:34.550 --> 05:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
can suck sometimes with all the cars and
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be awesome if we had
 
05:15:38.090 --> 05:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
thousands of less cars on the road each
 
05:15:40.250 --> 05:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
day depending on the level of service of
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
this rail because folks can choose to
 
05:15:45.470 --> 05:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
take the rail and some folks you know if
 
05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
they still have to take their car out of
 
05:15:49.250 --> 05:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
necessity or if they want to drive they
 
05:15:51.170 --> 05:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
can and the roads would be a better
 
05:15:52.970 --> 05:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
experience for them because of that
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
reduced congestion and rail is scalable
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
too so very Mary will you know save us
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
from having to endlessly pursue new
 
05:16:01.010 --> 05:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
highway widening projects we just spent
 
05:16:04.850 --> 05:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
751 million dollars widening I-93 and if
 
05:16:06.288 --> 05:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
we continue to increase in population
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
and if we continue to have more drivers
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
that would become a prerogative in the
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
future as well which could negatively
 
05:16:13.910 --> 05:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
impact the surrounding communities the
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
environment and just cost a lot of money
 
05:16:15.600 --> 05:16:16.368 align:start position:0%
environment and just cost a lot of money
too

05:16:16.368 --> 05:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:16:19.128 --> 05:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
so rails service is also an important
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
part of the vision that we have for the
 
05:16:23.810 --> 05:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
future here in Manchester so the return
 
05:16:26.270 --> 05:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
of regional passenger rail service to
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
the city is a critical component of our
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
master plan which we adopted just again
 
05:16:33.110 --> 05:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we have approved some potential
 
05:16:35.208 --> 05:16:35.218 align:start position:0%
sites within City boundaries and a
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
potential layover site as well we've
 
05:16:38.810 --> 05:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
additionally designated an entire
 
05:16:40.250 --> 05:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
Transit oriented development District
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
that would be rejuvenated by the
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
rearrival of Passenger rail in
 
05:16:45.170 --> 05:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester which we did have
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
historically but it has gone by the
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
wayside residents businesses and other
 
05:16:50.330 --> 05:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from across the community
 
05:16:52.430 --> 05:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
are enthusiastic about this endeavor and
 
05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
it would throw an enormous wrench in our
 
05:16:55.850 --> 05:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
plans if houseboat 110 were to become
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
law now some other stuff that hasn't
 
05:17:00.170 --> 05:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
been mentioned before first supporters
 
05:17:02.330 --> 05:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 110 and opponents of rail
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
Transit generally May opine that
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
commuter rail is passe that it is
 
05:17:08.570 --> 05:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
outdated and that is it's irrelevant to
 
05:17:10.970 --> 05:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
the modern economy and actually perhaps
 
05:17:13.850 --> 05:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
to your surprise I agree with them this
 
05:17:16.128 --> 05:17:16.138 align:start position:0%
discussion has moved on and more and
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
more people like myself are no longer
 
05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
interested in commuter rail nine to five
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
job stuff because that is a notion from
 
05:17:24.170 --> 05:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
the past instead we're focused on
 
05:17:25.250 --> 05:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
building out an integrated
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
round-the-clock Regional passenger rail
 
05:17:29.090 --> 05:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
service that suits a variety of needs
 
05:17:31.128 --> 05:17:31.138 align:start position:0%
not just commuting to and from work but
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
inclusive of that so that's an important
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
shift in the conversation that I think
 
05:17:36.650 --> 05:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
the committee should keep in mind as we
 
05:17:37.788 --> 05:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
05:17:40.010 --> 05:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
and second it's important for this
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
committee to consider the short and
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
long-term costs of Transportation
 
05:17:44.810 --> 05:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
projects so here in New Hampshire we
 
05:17:45.948 --> 05:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
spend hundreds of millions of dollars
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
each year expanding and maintaining our
 
05:17:49.788 --> 05:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
Statewide Road Network yet we deem it
 
05:17:51.770 --> 05:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
worthwhile we think there's value to it
 
05:17:53.208 --> 05:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to Regional Rail
 
05:17:55.310 --> 05:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
capacity yes there would be a cost as
 
05:17:56.930 --> 05:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
well but the state would only be
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for a limited amount of
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
matching funds I'm sure you all are
 
05:18:01.730 --> 05:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
familiar with the various FTA grants we
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
get for roads there are also lots of
 
05:18:05.330 --> 05:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
grants available for rail projects and
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
every Rider would pay some sort of use
 
05:18:10.010 --> 05:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
fee user fee to buy a ticket and whatnot
 
05:18:11.930 --> 05:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
to help defray the costs of operation
 
05:18:14.030 --> 05:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
and maintenance so in a way future Rail
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
lines could be similar to our existing
 
05:18:18.050 --> 05:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
turnpikes where drivers pay a toll and
 
05:18:20.448 --> 05:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
regardless we don't expect our all of
 
05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
our roads to turn a profit and we
 
05:18:24.770 --> 05:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
shouldn't unnecessarily hold rail to a
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
higher standard the last thing I would
 
05:18:28.010 --> 05:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
like to say before wrapping up here is
 
05:18:29.448 --> 05:18:29.458 align:start position:0%
that as someone else has mentioned
 
05:18:31.610 --> 05:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
houseboat 110 unduly short circuits the
 
05:18:33.050 --> 05:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
upcoming 10-year Transportation plan
 
05:18:35.330 --> 05:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
process the governor himself had said in
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
December 2022 when the executive Council
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
um kind of next the The Project declined
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
an extension of the timeline he said
 
05:18:44.690 --> 05:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
that supporters of Regional Rail would
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to advocate for its
 
05:18:48.050 --> 05:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
inclusion in the next 10-year
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan I would love to come
 
05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
back here again uh if you have hearings
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
for that and speak with you again but
 
05:18:54.590 --> 05:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
whichever direction that plan goes
 
05:18:56.270 --> 05:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
please don't let this legislation
 
05:18:58.190 --> 05:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
shortchange that process and prevent
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
those discussion discussions from
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
happening in the first place so with
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
that respectfully SCU designate this
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislation as in expedient to legislate
 
05:19:07.610 --> 05:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you I'd be happy to answer
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Mr Scott are
 
05:19:13.490 --> 05:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the gentleman
 
05:19:19.490 --> 05:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:24.010 --> 05:19:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:27.708 --> 05:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.288 --> 05:19:30.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh good afternoon
 
05:19:32.090 --> 05:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:19:34.190 --> 05:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
Gwendolyn Ricard Hayes I'm a lifelong
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
resident of Epping New Hampshire and I'm
 
05:19:38.208 --> 05:19:38.218 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in strong opposition
 
05:19:40.850 --> 05:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 110. uh when I was four
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
years old I experienced a car collision
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
that forever changed my life it not only
 
05:19:47.090 --> 05:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
took away my mother but also my ability
 
05:19:48.770 --> 05:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
to feel safe while driving in a car
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for me the local leaders
 
05:19:53.090 --> 05:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
of the past and present have failed to
 
05:19:55.550 --> 05:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
consider or care about the people like
 
05:19:57.170 --> 05:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
me who do not want to be forced into
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
cars as a sole means of transportation
 
05:20:02.090 --> 05:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
why have we been ignored the motor and
 
05:20:04.250 --> 05:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
oil industry has always been very
 
05:20:06.170 --> 05:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
effective at lobbying those in power to
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
help increase profit margins that's why
 
05:20:11.208 --> 05:20:11.218 align:start position:0%
we've been ignored profit margins oil is
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
a dying industry it must be a dying
 
05:20:16.010 --> 05:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
industry in order to save our planet we
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
have to kill it cars are not the future
 
05:20:20.510 --> 05:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
they are simply too inefficient too
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
space demanding and too destructive to
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
the planet electrification does not
 
05:20:27.650 --> 05:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
solve these issues the solution fund any
 
05:20:30.288 --> 05:20:30.298 align:start position:0%
other form of transportation and fund it
 
05:20:32.030 --> 05:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
significantly people will use the
 
05:20:34.128 --> 05:20:34.138 align:start position:0%
options given to them in the long run
 
05:20:36.110 --> 05:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
this would also be the more economically
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
efficient Venture for the local
 
05:20:37.920 --> 05:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
efficient Venture for the local
communities

05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:20:41.208 --> 05:20:41.218 align:start position:0%
creating a local web of Transportation
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
options expands the possible pool of
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
patrons by making it significantly
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
easier and accessible to get places
 
05:20:49.610 --> 05:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
therefore increasing traffic to local
 
05:20:52.730 --> 05:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
businesses along with that benefit uh we
 
05:20:54.050 --> 05:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
no longer need to spend Millions
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining a massive Road system this
 
05:20:58.368 --> 05:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
bill would ban State funds for passenger
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
rail projects why would we want to do
 
05:21:02.690 --> 05:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
such a thing the whole point of society
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
in governments is to use our Mass
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
resources to improve the quality of life
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
and make life more accessible for all
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is completely antithetical to
 
05:21:13.310 --> 05:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
that ethos members of the committee when
 
05:21:14.810 --> 05:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
you vote on this bill please consider
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
the many people like me who for whatever
 
05:21:19.010 --> 05:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
personal reason do not feel comfortable
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
driving in a car and if given the choice
 
05:21:23.690 --> 05:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
would choose otherwise please vote in
 
05:21:26.330 --> 05:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on hb110 thank
 
05:21:28.010 --> 05:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you thank you
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and everything
 
05:21:32.890 --> 05:21:32.900 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
I believe I hold in my hand the last
 
05:21:40.440 --> 05:21:41.890 align:start position:0%
I believe I hold in my hand the last
speaker

05:21:41.890 --> 05:21:41.900 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:51.948 --> 05:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:54.110 --> 05:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
and once again I apologize for not
 
05:21:56.090 --> 05:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
extending the courtesy of putting you in
 
05:21:58.368 --> 05:21:58.378 align:start position:0%
front but we've been we've been hours
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
here thank you that's fine uh thank you
 
05:22:04.310 --> 05:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I intentionally held my
 
05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
card back because I thought it would
 
05:22:07.250 --> 05:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
give me an opportunity to answer some
 
05:22:09.470 --> 05:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
questions that people had for the record
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Kathy Staub I'm
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative of Hillsboro 25 which is
 
05:22:18.288 --> 05:22:18.298 align:start position:0%
um Ward 5 in Manchester and I'm here
 
05:22:20.930 --> 05:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition in opposition to
 
05:22:24.890 --> 05:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
this bill I think one of the issues that
 
05:22:24.900 --> 05:22:25.490 align:start position:0%
this bill I think one of the issues that
um

05:22:25.490 --> 05:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:28.190 --> 05:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
we have with this is that
 
05:22:30.650 --> 05:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
um prior to the pandemic I I did a lot
 
05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
of research on this issue a number of
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
years ago and I will be sending some
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
emails to you with some links so you can
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
read some of the stuff that I I have
 
05:22:40.850 --> 05:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
written about this but prior to the
 
05:22:43.070 --> 05:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was an estimated 80 000
 
05:22:45.410 --> 05:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
people who commuted from New Hampshire
 
05:22:46.930 --> 05:22:46.940 align:start position:0%
into Massachusetts
 
05:22:49.970 --> 05:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
anyone who's been on 93 recently I
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
babysit a couple days a week down in
 
05:22:53.448 --> 05:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the roads are still
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
very congested
 
05:22:55.200 --> 05:22:57.070 align:start position:0%
very congested
um

05:22:57.070 --> 05:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:01.310 --> 05:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
by not including a passenger rail as
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
part of our Intermodal transportation
 
05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
system I think we're missing a loss
 
05:23:08.090 --> 05:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity we do have those Rail lines
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
that come up the Merrimack Valley it
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
would be a great way for us to get
 
05:23:15.070 --> 05:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles off of the road
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles also carriers of
 
05:23:21.890 --> 05:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
freight there there is some utilization
 
05:23:24.410 --> 05:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
of that currently but because the tracks
 
05:23:27.610 --> 05:23:27.620 align:start position:0%
are slow 15 miles an hour
 
05:23:30.288 --> 05:23:30.298 align:start position:0%
there isn't quite as much utilization as
 
05:23:32.030 --> 05:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
there could be
 
05:23:32.040 --> 05:23:33.350 align:start position:0%
there could be
um

05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:36.050 --> 05:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to address a couple of the
 
05:23:37.610 --> 05:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
questions that came up for example
 
05:23:39.050 --> 05:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
people talked about
 
05:23:41.470 --> 05:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
um I I apologize
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm having pink cards show up all of a
 
05:23:45.530 --> 05:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
sudden are they sitting in front of
 
05:23:45.540 --> 05:23:49.810 align:start position:0%
sudden are they sitting in front of
members

05:23:49.810 --> 05:23:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.910 --> 05:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'm sorry Representative no
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
05:23:56.690 --> 05:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
um the Downeaster for example you know
 
05:23:58.250 --> 05:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
they talked about loss of utilization
 
05:24:00.590 --> 05:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic they reached their
 
05:24:04.128 --> 05:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
Peak at about 500 000 and this last year
 
05:24:06.890 --> 05:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
it was already back up to 400 000 and
 
05:24:09.788 --> 05:24:09.798 align:start position:0%
they expect to reach 500 000 again
 
05:24:12.590 --> 05:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
there are lots of opportunities that
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
some folks have spoken about already in
 
05:24:17.230 --> 05:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
05:24:20.930 --> 05:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
development the rail station in
 
05:24:23.570 --> 05:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester would be in the area within
 
05:24:25.850 --> 05:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
walking distance of this new Arena and
 
05:24:28.970 --> 05:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
the Fisher Cats baseball stadium in
 
05:24:31.390 --> 05:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
downtown Manchester that will
 
05:24:35.570 --> 05:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly produce a lot of additional
 
05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
room and meals taxes for the state also
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's already started to be a lot of
 
05:24:43.850 --> 05:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
housing development in that area in
 
05:24:45.948 --> 05:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
anticipation of this rail station going
 
05:24:49.490 --> 05:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
in so real estate trans transfer taxes
 
05:24:52.310 --> 05:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
Etc will will also come into the state
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
coffers based on this on this project
 
05:24:59.330 --> 05:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
it's um somebody also asked a question
 
05:25:02.090 --> 05:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
about any non-subsidized uh passenger
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
rail line the bright line in Florida is
 
05:25:07.730 --> 05:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
fairly new and it it is a privately
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
owned rail operation you know this is
 
05:25:13.850 --> 05:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of money on roads
 
05:25:18.230 --> 05:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
expanding 93 cost us 770 million dollars
 
05:25:21.708 --> 05:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
in the project to expand Route 3 is 168
 
05:25:24.170 --> 05:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts the city of Boston is
 
05:25:27.180 --> 05:25:29.690 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts the city of Boston is
is

05:25:29.690 --> 05:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.610 --> 05:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say that word but
 
05:25:33.890 --> 05:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
they're very focused on reducing their
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
on greenhouse gas emissions by 25 and so
 
05:25:38.330 --> 05:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
they don't want any more cars in their
 
05:25:40.610 --> 05:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
city so for that reason they have they
 
05:25:42.170 --> 05:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
have stated in no uncertain terms that
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
they will not expand 93 or route 3. so
 
05:25:47.330 --> 05:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
no matter how many lanes we put in in
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as soon as you hit the
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
Border it's going down to three and
 
05:25:52.970 --> 05:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
anyone who's gone down there and has had
 
05:25:55.788 --> 05:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
to deal with that bottleneck um again
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not good so
 
05:26:02.810 --> 05:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
you know a bunch of other people have
 
05:26:04.128 --> 05:26:04.138 align:start position:0%
said a bunch of stuff also the other
 
05:26:05.448 --> 05:26:05.458 align:start position:0%
point that I would like to make is that
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
Boston expressed the last time I checked
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
received six hundred thousand dollars
 
05:26:10.970 --> 05:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
per year from the state
 
05:26:14.208 --> 05:26:14.218 align:start position:0%
um in um subsidies and at that uh at
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
that point that I had done that research
 
05:26:18.170 --> 05:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
they were preparing to buy new buses for
 
05:26:21.530 --> 05:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
the for the Boston Express so
 
05:26:24.410 --> 05:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know public transportation it's it's
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
a quality of life issue and this my my
 
05:26:31.010 --> 05:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
personal philosophy is that um we we
 
05:26:33.050 --> 05:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
support the state so that it can get the
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
things for us that we can't get as
 
05:26:38.208 --> 05:26:38.218 align:start position:0%
individuals so and I would like you to
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
consider all that as you think about how
 
05:26:40.680 --> 05:26:41.448 align:start position:0%
consider all that as you think about how
to

05:26:41.448 --> 05:26:41.458 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:26:41.458 --> 05:26:42.788 align:start position:0%
to
um

05:26:42.788 --> 05:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
how to recommend this bill and I would
 
05:26:46.850 --> 05:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
05:26:51.050 --> 05:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
um on itl would be beneficial for those
 
05:26:52.730 --> 05:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
of us in Manchester and really everyone
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
um one more thing the airport more
 
05:27:00.610 --> 05:27:00.620 align:start position:0%
people use the airport the more carriers
 
05:27:04.010 --> 05:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
not having rail is is a is a barrier to
 
05:27:05.930 --> 05:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
that so if more people were able to
 
05:27:08.330 --> 05:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
utilize the airport more carriers would
 
05:27:10.490 --> 05:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
come in prices would go down anybody
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
who's ever used Manchester Airport would
 
05:27:14.810 --> 05:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
benefit so that's all I have to say and
 
05:27:16.368 --> 05:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
I thank you so much for hearing my
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and have a nice afternoon
 
05:27:20.448 --> 05:27:20.458 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
05:27:22.850 --> 05:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative do
 
05:27:26.510 --> 05:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:27:31.208 --> 05:27:31.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:38.690 --> 05:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:41.330 --> 05:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
Jane welcome to public works thank you
 
05:27:43.788 --> 05:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
very much uh chairman my name is Jane
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
hake and I'm a resident of Manchester
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
just representing myself
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm very interested in I think of
 
05:27:53.570 --> 05:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
myself as a futurist I like to think
 
05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
about what the future is going to be
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
like I don't think I've ever talked to
 
05:27:58.310 --> 05:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
anybody in New Hampshire that doesn't
 
05:28:01.128 --> 05:28:01.138 align:start position:0%
want the economy to grow I think we hear
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
a lot about growing the economy and um
 
05:28:08.448 --> 05:28:08.458 align:start position:0%
I think that if you think ahead
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
the idea that all the people that are
 
05:28:12.050 --> 05:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
going to come and take the jobs that
 
05:28:14.570 --> 05:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to have in New Hampshire
 
05:28:16.490 --> 05:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
that they're all going to commute in
 
05:28:20.050 --> 05:28:20.060 align:start position:0%
cars is really kind of on unrealistic as
 
05:28:23.890 --> 05:28:23.900 align:start position:0%
my associate representative Staub said
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
they're not going to expand 93 or 3
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
anymore and
 
05:28:28.798 --> 05:28:29.570 align:start position:0%
anymore and
um

05:28:29.570 --> 05:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:31.490 --> 05:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to leave out some of my
 
05:28:33.890 --> 05:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
05:28:35.930 --> 05:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
as some people seem to see The Rail Link
 
05:28:40.970 --> 05:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
as exporting workers to Boston I think
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's more likely that we'll be importing
 
05:28:46.850 --> 05:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
workers from Lowell and Boston and areas
 
05:28:49.490 --> 05:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
like that for instance as the Chamber of
 
05:28:52.128 --> 05:28:52.138 align:start position:0%
Commerce representative mentioned the
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
new jobs at the bio lab facilities that
 
05:28:56.750 --> 05:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to create and we already
 
05:28:59.090 --> 05:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
have an enormous grant to get that
 
05:29:00.770 --> 05:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
industry underway those are going to be
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
lab jobs those are not going to be like
 
05:29:07.128 --> 05:29:07.138 align:start position:0%
jobs that people can work remotely at
 
05:29:10.128 --> 05:29:10.138 align:start position:0%
and um so we have to think of ourselves
 
05:29:13.270 --> 05:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
and see it as a periphery of the Boston
 
05:29:15.530 --> 05:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area and even though the
 
05:29:17.570 --> 05:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
rest of New Hampshire is not necessarily
 
05:29:20.930 --> 05:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
going to ride the railroad as the
 
05:29:24.170 --> 05:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
representative from Nashua said it's a
 
05:29:25.970 --> 05:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money that comes into the
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy and thus the state
 
05:29:32.570 --> 05:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
coffers from those Industries
 
05:29:35.810 --> 05:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to say if we don't
 
05:29:38.390 --> 05:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
facilitate the creation of a rail line
 
05:29:38.400 --> 05:29:39.410 align:start position:0%
facilitate the creation of a rail line
now

05:29:39.410 --> 05:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to find ourselves paying
 
05:29:46.610 --> 05:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
much more for it in 5 10 or 15 years and
 
05:29:48.650 --> 05:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
that this will also benefit anybody who
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
wants to commute who might still be
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
commuting down to Boston because the the
 
05:29:55.368 --> 05:29:55.378 align:start position:0%
uh the roads won't be as crowded really
 
05:29:57.410 --> 05:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
we can't the roads can't get much
 
05:30:00.050 --> 05:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
crowded before they hit gridlock which I
 
05:30:01.850 --> 05:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
think will happen in five years if we
 
05:30:04.250 --> 05:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
don't do anything so that's all I have
 
05:30:06.110 --> 05:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
to say thank you very much thank you for
 
05:30:07.610 --> 05:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there anyone with
 
05:30:07.620 --> 05:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there anyone with
questions

05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:30:14.208 --> 05:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:19.490 --> 05:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
um last last to speak uh Henry good
 
05:30:28.670 --> 05:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:31.128 --> 05:30:31.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and thank you
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh president of Concord originally from
 
05:30:35.810 --> 05:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm a proponent of rails
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
passenger rail service
 
05:30:41.570 --> 05:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh I have my issues uh with the commuter
 
05:30:42.770 --> 05:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
rail they're talking about because it
 
05:30:44.448 --> 05:30:44.458 align:start position:0%
doesn't do weekends
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's just talking about during the week
 
05:30:49.128 --> 05:30:49.138 align:start position:0%
I also should point out too that I'm a
 
05:30:51.050 --> 05:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
member of train riders Northeast which
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
is the advocacy group that started the
 
05:30:53.520 --> 05:30:54.770 align:start position:0%
is the advocacy group that started the
Downeaster

05:30:54.770 --> 05:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
Downeaster
 
05:30:58.550 --> 05:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
and as part of that I worked as a
 
05:31:00.830 --> 05:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer as a train host
 
05:31:04.010 --> 05:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
helping passengers Portland Brunswick to
 
05:31:05.750 --> 05:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
Boston and back
 
05:31:09.288 --> 05:31:09.298 align:start position:0%
my issue with this bill is a lot of
 
05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
05:31:13.970 --> 05:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
talks about economic growth mass transit
 
05:31:18.410 --> 05:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
and then eviscerates it my question is
 
05:31:21.050 --> 05:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
Amtrak may want to put in service from
 
05:31:24.170 --> 05:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
Boston to Manchester Concord this could
 
05:31:25.730 --> 05:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
preclude that
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
train right as Northeast is working with
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
Maine to
 
05:31:35.150 --> 05:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
create a cross-platform transfer in
 
05:31:39.170 --> 05:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
Boston to a train to New York City
 
05:31:42.708 --> 05:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
to me this is an Avenue for tourism
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of Europeans United States Asians
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
whatever are very comfortable using
 
05:31:48.718 --> 05:31:49.788 align:start position:0%
whatever are very comfortable using
trains

05:31:49.788 --> 05:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
trains
 
05:31:52.430 --> 05:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be very favorable
 
05:31:54.830 --> 05:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire for people to come who
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to rent a car don't want to
 
05:31:56.638 --> 05:31:57.470 align:start position:0%
don't want to rent a car don't want to
drive

05:31:57.470 --> 05:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
drive
 
05:32:01.250 --> 05:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
so I I call that potential growth uh
 
05:32:04.310 --> 05:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's an option and uh I think there
 
05:32:07.250 --> 05:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
would be this would be a detriment to
 
05:32:09.590 --> 05:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
that type of service and I close with
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
just a couple of thoughts that not
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
they're not my thoughts I read them
 
05:32:14.650 --> 05:32:14.660 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:32:18.230 --> 05:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh Americans love Mobility
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the automobile
 
05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
if you can get somewhere the other
 
05:32:24.110 --> 05:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
another way you may choose that if you
 
05:32:26.090 --> 05:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
have that option and the other one I
 
05:32:27.530 --> 05:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
always like to think about when I look
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
at any kind of a project not just rail
 
05:32:30.000 --> 05:32:31.490 align:start position:0%
at any kind of a project not just rail
is

05:32:31.490 --> 05:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:32:31.500 --> 05:32:33.650 align:start position:0%
is
subsidy

05:32:33.650 --> 05:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
subsidy
 
05:32:36.350 --> 05:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
subsidies to me is if you don't like the
 
05:32:36.360 --> 05:32:37.250 align:start position:0%
subsidies to me is if you don't like the
project

05:32:37.250 --> 05:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:32:39.288 --> 05:32:39.298 align:start position:0%
if you like a project
 
05:32:40.910 --> 05:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's investment
 
05:32:42.170 --> 05:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
and I think there would be a lot of
 
05:32:44.448 --> 05:32:44.458 align:start position:0%
investment into New Hampshire
 
05:32:47.150 --> 05:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
with passenger rail service
 
05:32:49.250 --> 05:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
05:32:52.190 --> 05:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
sir any questions to the gentleman
 
05:32:55.010 --> 05:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you

I have no other ping cards uh for House

05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
electric field infrastructure refers to
 
05:34:39.530 --> 05:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
the network of charging stations and
 
05:34:41.150 --> 05:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
other sporting systems needed to power
 
05:34:41.160 --> 05:34:42.948 align:start position:0%
other sporting systems needed to power
EVS

05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
EVS
 
05:34:44.750 --> 05:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
the development and expansion of PV
 
05:34:46.250 --> 05:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is crucial for the
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
anticipation adoption of EVS it's no
 
05:34:50.990 --> 05:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
longer a question of if we switch to EVS
 
05:34:52.550 --> 05:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
but how soon
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
CNN recently projected that EV sales
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
will outstrip internal combustion
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
Vehicles by 2040 17 years from now
 
05:35:06.410 --> 05:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
as of 2021 New Hampshire had 4 000 EVS
 
05:35:06.420 --> 05:35:07.610 align:start position:0%
as of 2021 New Hampshire had 4 000 EVS
registered

05:35:07.610 --> 05:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
registered
 
05:35:09.890 --> 05:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
California leads by a wide margin of the
 
05:35:11.930 --> 05:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
563 thousand
 
05:35:13.850 --> 05:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
representing 42 percent of all
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
registered cars in their state
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
I am could I have you suspend the
 
05:35:20.090 --> 05:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
gentleman with the camera could you move
 
05:35:21.288 --> 05:35:21.298 align:start position:0%
ahead of
 
05:35:23.270 --> 05:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
the representatives I'd appreciate it
 
05:35:24.890 --> 05:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
and you should have room to do your work
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:32.448 --> 05:35:32.458 align:start position:0%
politics aside auto manufacturers are
 
05:35:33.770 --> 05:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
listening and adjusting their production
 
05:35:35.208 --> 05:35:35.218 align:start position:0%
of EVS
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
States other than New Hampshire are
 
05:35:38.750 --> 05:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
driving the demand for EPs and like it
 
05:35:40.550 --> 05:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
or not the free market is transitioning
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
away from internal combustion engines
 
05:35:46.430 --> 05:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 606 is drafted in response to
 
05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
this Market Direction
 
05:35:49.610 --> 05:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
if predictions for future charging
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
stations are to be met the time delayed
 
05:35:53.628 --> 05:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure to meet these needs
 
05:35:54.770 --> 05:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
is now
 
05:35:56.810 --> 05:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
undeniably the laying of electric cable
 
05:35:58.190 --> 05:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
is much easier when it's part of the
 
05:36:00.050 --> 05:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
original construction rather in
 
05:36:02.270 --> 05:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
retrofitting in an existing structure
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill makes scant requirements for
 
05:36:05.690 --> 05:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
what's above ground but ensures a vital
 
05:36:08.030 --> 05:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
cable is in place as preparation for a
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
charging station so I should stop here
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
and add that the title of the bill enact
 
05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
I find that may be a little bit
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
misleading so I'm really addressing more
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
now having a driven electric vehicle
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
myself perhaps it might be helpful to
 
05:36:27.050 --> 05:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
discuss what is meant by EV ready
 
05:36:29.690 --> 05:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
you have an EV if you have a 120 volt
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
electric dryer in your house
 
05:36:33.770 --> 05:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
none of your house is already EV ready
 
05:36:35.330 --> 05:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
by virtual having that receptacle
 
05:36:36.890 --> 05:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
available it'll look something like this
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
if I may use a visual age Aid
 
05:36:42.770 --> 05:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
um summer three prong this one happens
 
05:36:45.410 --> 05:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
before this is from an EV not for my
 
05:36:45.420 --> 05:36:48.288 align:start position:0%
before this is from an EV not for my
dryer

05:36:48.288 --> 05:36:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
um EV capable means that the wiring is
 
05:36:53.448 --> 05:36:53.458 align:start position:0%
installed but the plug is absent
 
05:36:55.970 --> 05:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
EV installed means that I bring the
 
05:36:57.288 --> 05:36:57.298 align:start position:0%
charging cable that came with the
 
05:36:59.750 --> 05:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
purchase of my EV and plug it into the
 
05:37:01.850 --> 05:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
220 volt receptacle
 
05:37:04.430 --> 05:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
aside from Tesla all EVS are universally
 
05:37:07.010 --> 05:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
capable of plugging to a standard 220
 
05:37:09.708 --> 05:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
volt receptacle
 
05:37:11.930 --> 05:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
on the other end is a meter the branch
 
05:37:13.730 --> 05:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
circuit can be tied to an existing meter
 
05:37:16.010 --> 05:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
or employ a standalone meter
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
this being said in the case of an
 
05:37:18.830 --> 05:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
apartment complex
 
05:37:20.690 --> 05:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
each branch circuit can be conducted to
 
05:37:23.230 --> 05:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
the meter of a particular residence
 
05:37:26.448 --> 05:37:26.458 align:start position:0%
going off just one of this one second if
 
05:37:28.250 --> 05:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
you and if you remember a few years ago
 
05:37:30.530 --> 05:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
we had two meters on our houses one for
 
05:37:30.540 --> 05:37:32.030 align:start position:0%
we had two meters on our houses one for
water

05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
we could do the same conceivably for
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
05:37:39.350 --> 05:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
um in the case of a fleet a circuit we
 
05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
run on a time and meter obviously
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
now while I've invested various codes on
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
the way to recommendations listed in
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
this bill but I am very open adjusting
 
05:37:49.730 --> 05:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
these recommendations either by
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment or by subcommittee
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
these are changing times and I hope the
 
05:37:55.190 --> 05:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee can seize the bill as an
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the future rather into a
 
05:38:00.050 --> 05:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
threat to our status quo I asked for an
 
05:38:01.610 --> 05:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
OTP and thank the committee for their
 
05:38:04.128 --> 05:38:04.138 align:start position:0%
time I'll take any questions thank you
 
05:38:09.288 --> 05:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:16.730 --> 05:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
the question I have when the automobile
 
05:38:20.170 --> 05:38:20.180 align:start position:0%
came in to be the combustion engine
 
05:38:24.410 --> 05:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
automobile came in to be uh who financed
 
05:38:26.690 --> 05:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
all the gas stations to be put in place
 
05:38:28.850 --> 05:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
as an infrastructure
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
and with that being said since this is
 
05:38:32.638 --> 05:38:34.490 align:start position:0%
and with that being said since this is
electricity

05:38:34.490 --> 05:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:38:36.890 --> 05:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
with the electric company be a better
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
place to install or have the ability to
 
05:38:44.690 --> 05:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
install these charging stations as it is
 
05:38:46.610 --> 05:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
electricity and that is something the
 
05:38:51.890 --> 05:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
electric company sales is electricity
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
I can under that's a very good question
 
05:38:55.368 --> 05:38:55.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:38:55.378 --> 05:38:56.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:58.610 --> 05:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
I think that the electric company would
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
benefit from the addition of these
 
05:39:02.868 --> 05:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles because they would be able to
 
05:39:05.208 --> 05:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
charge through the monthly bill
 
05:39:05.218 --> 05:39:06.708 align:start position:0%
charge through the monthly bill
however

05:39:06.708 --> 05:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
um as far as having them pay for the
 
05:39:12.590 --> 05:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure on an apartment complex
 
05:39:14.570 --> 05:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
or a
 
05:39:16.490 --> 05:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
parking garage that's funded with
 
05:39:19.310 --> 05:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
federal dollars you might find it a very
 
05:39:21.050 --> 05:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
hard sell to approach ever source and
 
05:39:22.850 --> 05:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
ask them to put up that up
 
05:39:25.610 --> 05:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:28.190 --> 05:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
um there is money available for charging
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
stations uh
 
05:39:30.240 --> 05:39:31.910 align:start position:0%
stations uh
uh

05:39:31.910 --> 05:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:39:34.730 --> 05:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
up and down are public highways but this
 
05:39:36.410 --> 05:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
is Bill is not really about that this
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill is really about home charging
 
05:39:42.470 --> 05:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Jack thank
 
05:39:43.850 --> 05:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
you and uh thank you representative
 
05:39:46.610 --> 05:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
partial the title is a little bit
 
05:39:49.010 --> 05:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
incongruous in on line five it
 
05:39:51.530 --> 05:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
specifically calls out housing which I
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
think is your intent that it only
 
05:39:55.730 --> 05:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
applied to state-funded housing and yet
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill says state
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
buildings or state-funded projects which
 
05:40:01.610 --> 05:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
would seem to Encompass like State
 
05:40:04.010 --> 05:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
Office Buildings and and any other kind
 
05:40:05.868 --> 05:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
of thing but you're specifically
 
05:40:08.208 --> 05:40:08.218 align:start position:0%
targeted to housing here as it says in
 
05:40:10.550 --> 05:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
the bill the bill was to Target housing
 
05:40:13.970 --> 05:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
however uh in retrospect I don't think
 
05:40:15.590 --> 05:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
it would be a bad idea as we build new
 
05:40:17.208 --> 05:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
parking garage is to also consider
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
preparing ourselves for the future
 
05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
would be much easier fixing a parking
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
garage obviously yeah so follow-up for
 
05:40:25.610 --> 05:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
example and if I could ask one more
 
05:40:27.530 --> 05:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
question different question
 
05:40:29.390 --> 05:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
um this this amends the State Building
 
05:40:32.208 --> 05:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
Code uh there's another committee that
 
05:40:34.368 --> 05:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
typically deals with the State Building
 
05:40:36.170 --> 05:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
Code we may not have
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
um is that from your research in in
 
05:40:40.730 --> 05:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
developing the bill is there a problem
 
05:40:42.530 --> 05:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
with amending the State Building Code in
 
05:40:44.090 --> 05:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
this way that you know of
 
05:40:45.890 --> 05:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
none that I'm aware of and I do
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
understand that we are talking building
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
codes here and I know sometimes we get
 
05:40:52.730 --> 05:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
bills in front of us that we wonder why

thank you very much Mr chair members of
 
05:42:42.708 --> 05:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
the committee it's a pleasure to be here
 
05:42:44.690 --> 05:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
05:42:46.610 --> 05:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams I'm from South
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
Concord you're in ward 6 which is one of
 
05:42:50.570 --> 05:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
the words I represent it's a pleasure to
 
05:42:52.430 --> 05:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
have you in my home District
 
05:42:54.830 --> 05:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple bill
 
05:42:54.840 --> 05:42:55.730 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple bill
um

05:42:55.730 --> 05:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:57.970 --> 05:42:57.980 align:start position:0%
if you take a look at the language we're
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
adding some new statute information here
 
05:43:01.920 --> 05:43:02.868 align:start position:0%
adding some new statute information here
um

05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:06.770 --> 05:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
basically we're we're looking at uh
 
05:43:06.780 --> 05:43:09.010 align:start position:0%
basically we're we're looking at uh
adding

05:43:09.010 --> 05:43:09.020 align:start position:0%
adding
 
05:43:12.250 --> 05:43:12.260 align:start position:0%
the complete streets program
 
05:43:14.810 --> 05:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
as part of
 
05:43:18.830 --> 05:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
when funds are sent to a district so
 
05:43:21.470 --> 05:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
when cities and towns ask for money
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
that work is to be performed following
 
05:43:25.788 --> 05:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the complete streets
 
05:43:27.970 --> 05:43:27.980 align:start position:0%
program as opposed to
 
05:43:31.310 --> 05:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
Highway programs because we're talking
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
about local funds for local projects and
 
05:43:36.890 --> 05:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
local main streets and therefore the
 
05:43:38.708 --> 05:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
needs for things like bicycles
 
05:43:41.930 --> 05:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
pedestrians are very different than if
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
this was an actual Highway project so
 
05:43:46.010 --> 05:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
really what we're talking about here is
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
adding new language to integrate a
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
program that makes this more pedestrian
 
05:43:56.810 --> 05:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
friendly and more walkable for our towns
 
05:43:58.970 --> 05:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
specifically rural but really any town
 
05:44:02.510 --> 05:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
that needs funding to to do a project so
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
the intent here is to make complete
 
05:44:08.208 --> 05:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
streets the default not something that
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
the city or town has to struggle to
 
05:44:12.770 --> 05:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
achieve or overcome a barrier just by
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
way of background the aashto or ash toe
 
05:44:18.890 --> 05:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
standards are appropriate for State
 
05:44:21.948 --> 05:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
highways but not Town streets they
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
prioritize rapid vehicle movement often
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
over 35 miles an hour rather than Street
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
designs for multi-modal users
 
05:44:31.730 --> 05:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
towns that adopt a complete streets
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
policy have shown that they are
 
05:44:35.330 --> 05:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
interested in having their streets safe
 
05:44:37.490 --> 05:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
and welcoming to pedestrians bicycles
 
05:44:39.650 --> 05:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
and other modes of transportation in
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
addition to automobiles so that using
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
the nacto standards nacto standards is
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate a complete streets policy
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
identifies the roadways of a town or
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
city that the jurisdiction believes
 
05:44:55.250 --> 05:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
should be improved for multi-modal use
 
05:44:56.930 --> 05:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
so this is something the jurisdiction
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
wants not something be imposed by the
 
05:45:01.970 --> 05:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
state and once again this intends to
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
make this more friendly for pedestrians
 
05:45:07.070 --> 05:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
bicycles things other than Automobiles
 
05:45:09.230 --> 05:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's the the gist of the bill
 
05:45:11.090 --> 05:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
and I have to admit that I'm not an
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
expert on the subject matter there are
 
05:45:14.448 --> 05:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
people after me who will have much more
 
05:45:16.610 --> 05:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
technical responses but I'm happy to
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you thank you
 
05:45:20.628 --> 05:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative I
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
I don't I do not have any cards from any
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
one department or anyone else
 
05:45:31.128 --> 05:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
oh I have I I have a card here from uh
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
05:45:36.530 --> 05:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
so I just I just want to caution you on
 
05:45:41.530 --> 05:45:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:46.430 --> 05:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:48.650 --> 05:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
I hate to trouble you but could you just
 
05:45:50.510 --> 05:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
please fill out another card for us
 
05:45:50.520 --> 05:45:52.070 align:start position:0%
please fill out another card for us
please

05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:45:53.810 --> 05:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
um if if I could sure representative so
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a fan of of
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:10.250 --> 05:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
I and maybe I missed it uh can you
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
explain to me maintenance and repairs
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
and what you're anticipating the
 
05:46:20.330 --> 05:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
department to do I I offer most projects
 
05:46:24.530 --> 05:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
for even a simple sidewalk in my rural
 
05:46:28.190 --> 05:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
area requires that the town is going to
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
plow and maintain those structures so
 
05:46:34.368 --> 05:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
with money is limited maybe I'm missing
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
something tell me what you believe
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:42.830 --> 05:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding would be it would be a
 
05:46:44.570 --> 05:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
little bit more extensive than just a
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
sidewalk repair something like if there
 
05:46:50.090 --> 05:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
are new utilities coming through and
 
05:46:52.208 --> 05:46:52.218 align:start position:0%
you're going to have some kind of
 
05:46:55.010 --> 05:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
infrastructure such as manholes and
 
05:46:55.020 --> 05:46:56.330 align:start position:0%
infrastructure such as manholes and
repaving

05:46:56.330 --> 05:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
repaving
 
05:46:58.850 --> 05:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
Etc then considering complete streets as
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
part of that project
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry if I could follow up
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
so you would like to be to the table
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
when those projects after the after it's
 
05:47:12.350 --> 05:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
been decided by the town or your
 
05:47:16.128 --> 05:47:16.138 align:start position:0%
Regional Commission that this area is
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
qualified for this project
 
05:47:23.990 --> 05:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
whom whom would pay for manholes Paving
 
05:47:27.530 --> 05:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
and all and all of that work the cost to
 
05:47:30.770 --> 05:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
put underground utilities and so forth
 
05:47:33.410 --> 05:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
so as always it depends right every
 
05:47:34.730 --> 05:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
project is different you may have
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
applied for a grant you may have gotten
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
some federal funds as part of your your
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
walkable downtown or maybe not maybe the
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
town is just going to pay for this out
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
of their own pocket so it really depends
 
05:47:47.930 --> 05:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
on who's going to pay for it for the
 
05:47:50.270 --> 05:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
town and the project but the goal here
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
is really to put complete streets at the
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
front for the consideration of these
 
05:47:55.490 --> 05:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
kinds of projects so that we're not
 
05:47:57.770 --> 05:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
designing to the standards of 35 Plus
 
05:48:00.708 --> 05:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
miles an hour rather we're designing 235
 
05:48:03.530 --> 05:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
or below and therefore as part of the
 
05:48:05.208 --> 05:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
planning and deciding how to spend the
 
05:48:06.948 --> 05:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
funds we're considering walkability and
 
05:48:06.958 --> 05:48:08.628 align:start position:0%
funds we're considering walkability and
bicycling

05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
bicycling
 
05:48:10.850 --> 05:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome and I and I see
 
05:48:12.830 --> 05:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
now the department is going to speak so
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
anyone else with questions for the
 
05:48:14.638 --> 05:48:16.190 align:start position:0%
anyone else with questions for the
representative

05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:48:18.830 --> 05:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes represent Faulkner and I think this
 
05:48:19.850 --> 05:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
quick answer
 
05:48:23.090 --> 05:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
this could at least there's been Vision
 
05:48:25.128 --> 05:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
that every project every street project
 
05:48:27.530 --> 05:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
every new construction project comply
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
with this design standard to accommodate
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
other other modes or that you know are
 
05:48:35.930 --> 05:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
there are there pedestrian friendly
 
05:48:38.510 --> 05:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
streets versus traffic friendly streets
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
versus Transit streets
 
05:48:42.590 --> 05:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
what kind of flexibility would a
 
05:48:44.990 --> 05:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
municipality have
 
05:48:47.570 --> 05:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question thank you
 
05:48:50.090 --> 05:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I would say that the intention here
 
05:48:52.368 --> 05:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
is to consider complete streets as part
 
05:48:54.288 --> 05:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
of doing the project that doesn't mean
 
05:48:55.970 --> 05:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
that it's Bible that doesn't mean that
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happens but it's a
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
consideration so just as an example my
 
05:49:01.730 --> 05:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
district includes
 
05:49:04.910 --> 05:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
um Concord and some of you have driven
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
on Loudon Road in Concord it's a Strode
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
right it's kind of a combination Street
 
05:49:12.410 --> 05:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
Road it's got four lanes and an awful
 
05:49:15.470 --> 05:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
lot of strip retail there are sidewalks
 
05:49:17.448 --> 05:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't consider it particularly
 
05:49:20.208 --> 05:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
friendly to bicyclists at all if you
 
05:49:21.410 --> 05:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
want to use a bicycle on that road
 
05:49:22.548 --> 05:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
you're taking your life in your own
 
05:49:23.690 --> 05:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
hands you probably end up on the
 
05:49:25.310 --> 05:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
sidewalk anyway especially when there's
 
05:49:27.470 --> 05:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
snow on the ground so that's the kind of
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
development area that I think would be
 
05:49:31.208 --> 05:49:31.218 align:start position:0%
good for considering
 
05:49:33.708 --> 05:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
this program that doesn't mean it's
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
going to change a lot but it could
 
05:49:38.690 --> 05:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:41.208 --> 05:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh with the question yes
 
05:49:47.208 --> 05:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
please go ahead representative yes thank
 
05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:49:51.470 --> 05:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
question does this um
 
05:49:53.570 --> 05:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
National Association of City traffic
 
05:49:55.548 --> 05:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
officials or the complete Street
 
05:49:58.250 --> 05:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
advisories committee do they have any
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.070 --> 05:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
and yes they do yes
 
05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question further
 
05:50:10.670 --> 05:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
question yeah quick one so if somebody
 
05:50:13.010 --> 05:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't do what they say they want them
 
05:50:15.410 --> 05:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
to do what happens then
 
05:50:17.510 --> 05:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh so I believe there would be a
 
05:50:19.430 --> 05:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
discussion right there would probably be
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
a letter issued you know you intended to
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
do this program with complete streets
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
and then it fell through there would be
 
05:50:27.350 --> 05:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
a discussion and a follow-up I I don't
 
05:50:28.850 --> 05:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
believe there would be a fine if that's
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
what you're asking but there there are
 
05:50:33.230 --> 05:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
certainly goals to achieve and if you
 
05:50:34.490 --> 05:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
fail to achieve them then there's a
 
05:50:35.628 --> 05:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
discussion of what will we do to
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
remediate the situation
 
05:50:40.490 --> 05:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you
 
05:50:45.048 --> 05:50:45.058 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
05:50:51.430 --> 05:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:53.690 --> 05:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
it couldn't get much worse could it
 
05:50:55.548 --> 05:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
losing your card and then not spelling
 
05:50:56.448 --> 05:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
your name
 
05:50:59.448 --> 05:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
okay please thank you so much chairman
 
05:51:01.010 --> 05:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
and thank you members of this committee
 
05:51:04.850 --> 05:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
on which I actually served for a term I
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
think three years ago anyway it's nice
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
to be back uh this is a bill that I
 
05:51:12.288 --> 05:51:12.298 align:start position:0%
filed before I lost my primary thank you
 
05:51:15.170 --> 05:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
Rebecca for picking it up for me the
 
05:51:18.048 --> 05:51:18.058 align:start position:0%
goal here is all the things that Rebecca
 
05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
said right now if it's Town decides that
 
05:51:27.590 --> 05:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would like its Main Street which is a
 
05:51:32.208 --> 05:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
state highway to be a street rather than
 
05:51:36.350 --> 05:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
a road it is hard to make that
 
05:51:41.208 --> 05:51:41.218 align:start position:0%
negotiation work all the time often uh
 
05:51:43.490 --> 05:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
does the Department of Transportation
 
05:51:45.890 --> 05:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
correctly uses the American Association
 
05:51:47.628 --> 05:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
of state highway traffic officials
 
05:51:50.330 --> 05:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
standards for state highways those are
 
05:51:53.690 --> 05:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
the ashto standards they're intended for
 
05:51:55.730 --> 05:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
through streets for through roads
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
they're in 10 did for higher volumes
 
05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
higher speeds most of the towns in New
 
05:52:04.810 --> 05:52:04.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are bifurcated
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
by a state highway and that State
 
05:52:09.708 --> 05:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
Highway often functions as the main
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
street for the town
 
05:52:15.170 --> 05:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
when we run a
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
a highway through the middle of the Town
 
05:52:22.190 --> 05:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
it is not a great fit for the town for
 
05:52:25.250 --> 05:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
the businesses for the people it turns
 
05:52:27.970 --> 05:52:27.980 align:start position:0%
out that cars don't buy things people do
 
05:52:31.970 --> 05:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
so what the goal here is is to make our
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
main streets when they are a state
 
05:52:38.570 --> 05:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
highway more like a street slower more
 
05:52:41.330 --> 05:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
complete available for Walkers and
 
05:52:43.970 --> 05:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
bicyclists than people in Mobility
 
05:52:45.890 --> 05:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
assisted Mobility
 
05:52:48.288 --> 05:52:48.298 align:start position:0%
that's what this is intended to do is to
 
05:52:51.948 --> 05:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
say that if a town has identified
 
05:52:55.250 --> 05:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
the state highway that forms a piece of
 
05:52:58.730 --> 05:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
their town as a place where they want to
 
05:53:02.208 --> 05:53:02.218 align:start position:0%
see complete streets ideals instituted
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
this bill says
 
05:53:06.530 --> 05:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation has to
 
05:53:09.650 --> 05:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
has to support that the National
 
05:53:11.628 --> 05:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
Association of City traffic officials
 
05:53:13.970 --> 05:53:13.980 align:start position:0%
produces a book I think they updated
 
05:53:15.770 --> 05:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
about every three or four years it's
 
05:53:18.830 --> 05:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
green it's known as the green book and
 
05:53:22.368 --> 05:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
it has within it all of the standards
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
four streets that are usable for all
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
modes of transportation it doesn't mean
 
05:53:31.610 --> 05:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
that the cars are not welcome or that
 
05:53:34.070 --> 05:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
you can't drive a log truck down it it
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
means that it's going to be slower and
 
05:53:39.010 --> 05:53:39.020 align:start position:0%
safer and available
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
for all users not just people in
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles so that's the goal here is to
 
05:53:48.590 --> 05:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
put that conversation about what do we
 
05:53:51.470 --> 05:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
want this street to look like right at
 
05:53:53.690 --> 05:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the conversation so
 
05:53:55.548 --> 05:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
that towns don't feel like they're
 
05:53:55.558 --> 05:53:57.470 align:start position:0%
that towns don't feel like they're
battling

05:53:57.470 --> 05:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
battling
 
05:54:00.170 --> 05:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
the desire to make this more like a
 
05:54:00.180 --> 05:54:01.010 align:start position:0%
the desire to make this more like a
highway

05:54:01.010 --> 05:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
highway
 
05:54:03.048 --> 05:54:03.058 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions oh and
 
05:54:04.750 --> 05:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing I always forget to say
 
05:54:08.270 --> 05:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh I am actually an urban planner which
 
05:54:11.750 --> 05:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
is why I care deeply about this
 
05:54:14.930 --> 05:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and and my interest in this goes back
 
05:54:17.868 --> 05:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
to the idea of building places that are
 
05:54:20.570 --> 05:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
good for all people not just for people
 
05:54:23.570 --> 05:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
who are temporarily driving vehicles
 
05:54:26.208 --> 05:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to accept questions thank
 
05:54:28.190 --> 05:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Jack please uh thank
 
05:54:29.810 --> 05:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and it's good to see you
 
05:54:32.448 --> 05:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
again uh former representative uh I
 
05:54:34.010 --> 05:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
remember when we did the original study
 
05:54:36.350 --> 05:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
I went looking for what is in current
 
05:54:39.170 --> 05:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
law with respect to what people have to
 
05:54:40.850 --> 05:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
do with respect to complete streets and
 
05:54:42.410 --> 05:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
I wasn't able to find it I wonder if you
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
know what current law is there isn't a
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
law now that says that you have to do it
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
we talked about it I think it was in my
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
first term which would have been 2014.
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
we had a bill that would have said that
 
05:54:57.650 --> 05:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
the dot would use the complete Street
 
05:54:57.660 --> 05:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
the dot would use the complete Street
standards

05:54:59.510 --> 05:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:55:01.128 --> 05:55:01.138 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember what the parameters
 
05:55:03.230 --> 05:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
were but we did talk about it but in the
 
05:55:03.240 --> 05:55:04.788 align:start position:0%
were but we did talk about it but in the
end

05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
end
 
05:55:06.650 --> 05:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
um it kind of fizzled and I don't think
 
05:55:09.650 --> 05:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
I think the bill was withdrawn so so I
 
05:55:12.530 --> 05:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything now
 
05:55:17.690 --> 05:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:20.570 --> 05:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
yes represent boy thank you Mr chairman
 
05:55:22.850 --> 05:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative van for taking
 
05:55:25.610 --> 05:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
the bill is proposed how do you see this
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
being compatible with local land boards
 
05:55:35.208 --> 05:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
having the ability to plan their own
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
main streets
 
05:55:39.590 --> 05:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
um in independent from obviously they're
 
05:55:41.330 --> 05:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
within an urban compact the state record
 
05:55:44.570 --> 05:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
you know do you see this complementing I
 
05:55:47.090 --> 05:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
mean it can can this be enabling that
 
05:55:49.250 --> 05:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
gives me the spell is the flexibility of
 
05:55:51.170 --> 05:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
actually opting in if they see value to
 
05:55:52.850 --> 05:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
it right that's exactly what it does
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
because what it says is that in order
 
05:55:57.948 --> 05:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
for this to go into effect the town has
 
05:56:00.288 --> 05:56:00.298 align:start position:0%
to have adopted a complete streets
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
policy and identified the the street
 
05:56:08.810 --> 05:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
road Highway in question as a place
 
05:56:11.890 --> 05:56:11.900 align:start position:0%
where they want to see complete streets
 
05:56:15.530 --> 05:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
techniques and standards employed
 
05:56:19.670 --> 05:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
so it's an opt-in for the town
 
05:56:21.230 --> 05:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:24.590 --> 05:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
um if if I could sure so I'm still hung
 
05:56:27.110 --> 05:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
up on on the language of this and just
 
05:56:29.810 --> 05:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
briefly looked at the bill again
 
05:56:31.610 --> 05:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
um and it's talking about the the
 
05:56:34.610 --> 05:56:34.620 align:start position:0%
department to do road maintenance and
 
05:56:34.620 --> 05:56:36.350 align:start position:0%
department to do road maintenance and
repairs

05:56:36.350 --> 05:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
05:56:39.770 --> 05:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
so you start out the process and towns
 
05:56:42.530 --> 05:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
favorable and town wants to use the this
 
05:56:45.410 --> 05:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
practice and they want to make their
 
05:56:47.628 --> 05:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
Route 16 that runs through their Town
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
something where people can move and
 
05:56:51.770 --> 05:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
bicycle and so forth right
 
05:56:55.430 --> 05:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
and but tell me about the maintenance
 
05:56:58.810 --> 05:56:58.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's the same as it is now
 
05:57:05.930 --> 05:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
um now if the state is rebuilding a
 
05:57:10.128 --> 05:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
state highway the state pays for it and
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
um if the town wants to do something
 
05:57:12.840 --> 05:57:14.090 align:start position:0%
um if the town wants to do something
fancy

05:57:14.090 --> 05:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
fancy
 
05:57:16.430 --> 05:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
the town is responsible for the payment
 
05:57:20.930 --> 05:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
so the payment would re would remain the
 
05:57:23.208 --> 05:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
same so for example
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
um uh Route 202 goes through the town of
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and becomes Concord Street
 
05:57:31.910 --> 05:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
um when I was talking to the department
 
05:57:34.730 --> 05:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
about Concord Street and Peterborough
 
05:57:36.470 --> 05:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
has in fact adopted a complete Street
 
05:57:39.770 --> 05:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
policy and identified Concord Street as
 
05:57:41.690 --> 05:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
a street that needs to be more
 
05:57:44.690 --> 05:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
pedestrian and bicycle friendly
 
05:57:49.788 --> 05:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
um the state was paying for it and their
 
05:57:53.930 --> 05:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
their interest in providing a narrower
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
travel Lane and on-street parking both
 
05:58:00.368 --> 05:58:00.378 align:start position:0%
of which serve to slow traffic
 
05:58:03.948 --> 05:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
was somewhat Limited
 
05:58:05.930 --> 05:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
but back to your question about payment
 
05:58:08.208 --> 05:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
the payment would break down the same as
 
05:58:10.610 --> 05:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
it does now if it's a state highway the
 
05:58:12.288 --> 05:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
state pays for it they just use the
 
05:58:15.230 --> 05:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
nacto standards if the town wants
 
05:58:16.850 --> 05:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
something that is not the nacto
 
05:58:19.490 --> 05:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
standards one something fancier then
 
05:58:21.530 --> 05:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
they pay for it as they do now for
 
05:58:25.010 --> 05:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
example burying burying utility lines is
 
05:58:28.610 --> 05:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
I think nearly always a town expense and
 
05:58:30.410 --> 05:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
under this bill that would remain the
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
same does that help at all I understand
 
05:58:34.970 --> 05:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
it to me it just doesn't seem like a
 
05:58:36.288 --> 05:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
clear line but I'll speak to the
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
department yeah I mean and maybe we
 
05:58:39.890 --> 05:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
could have an amendment that made it
 
05:58:43.390 --> 05:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
more clearer what I'm trying to prevent
 
05:58:46.490 --> 05:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
is the state has regularly scheduled
 
05:58:48.890 --> 05:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
maintenance and rebuilding of Roads when
 
05:58:50.890 --> 05:58:50.900 align:start position:0%
they come to do that
 
05:58:55.430 --> 05:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
we want them to use the standards that
 
05:58:57.770 --> 05:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
the town wants if the town has
 
05:58:59.628 --> 05:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
identified this as a place where they
 
05:59:01.850 --> 05:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
want those nacto standards and the
 
05:59:03.530 --> 05:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
complete Street standards which are
 
05:59:05.150 --> 05:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
virtually the same
 
05:59:07.730 --> 05:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
then the state would do it without a
 
05:59:09.970 --> 05:59:09.980 align:start position:0%
giant battle thanks thank you for your
 
05:59:14.930 --> 05:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:18.590 --> 05:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so when they do
 
05:59:20.810 --> 05:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and let's say it's just
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
a regular
 
05:59:27.530 --> 05:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
Highway going in okay and then the town
 
05:59:30.288 --> 05:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
says Okay I want it to meet this new
 
05:59:33.470 --> 05:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
criteria okay and
 
05:59:36.110 --> 05:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
it now adds a greater expense on that
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance and does that it's a
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah and the second part of
 
05:59:43.548 --> 05:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:59:45.770 --> 05:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
if there's no available land without
 
05:59:47.628 --> 05:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
having to buy more land who's
 
05:59:50.330 --> 05:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
responsible for if they have to widen
 
05:59:53.090 --> 05:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
the road during in order to accommodate
 
05:59:55.490 --> 05:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
right the question of widening the road
 
05:59:58.610 --> 05:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
I think is not usually a problem because
 
06:00:00.708 --> 06:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
real usually the issue is what we're
 
06:00:03.530 --> 06:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
doing is reducing the road width the
 
06:00:06.590 --> 06:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
lane width so that then we have property
 
06:00:08.990 --> 06:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
available for other modes of
 
06:00:11.868 --> 06:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
transportation so I think I think that's
 
06:00:14.930 --> 06:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
less likely to be an issue the question
 
06:00:17.288 --> 06:00:17.298 align:start position:0%
of is this going to be more expensive
 
06:00:19.570 --> 06:00:19.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is sometimes it isn't
 
06:00:24.830 --> 06:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
however we budget money for the
 
06:00:28.610 --> 06:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
Department to build roads and I think
 
06:00:31.490 --> 06:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
that asking them to build the roads that
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
people want is is okay
 
06:00:37.368 --> 06:00:37.378 align:start position:0%
um it would it could in some cases mean
 
06:00:39.048 --> 06:00:39.058 align:start position:0%
a little more money it could in some
 
06:00:41.810 --> 06:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
cases mean less money because of that
 
06:00:43.490 --> 06:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
particularly for routine maintenance
 
06:00:46.490 --> 06:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
events routine resurfacing if you've
 
06:00:48.350 --> 06:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
narrowed your lanes then your cost for
 
06:00:50.448 --> 06:00:50.458 align:start position:0%
routine resurfacing is going to be less
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
than it would be if you had a 14-foot
 
06:00:53.520 --> 06:00:59.590 align:start position:0%
than it would be if you had a 14-foot
Lane

06:00:59.590 --> 06:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
and as a former member of Public Works
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to have you back in Rome
 
06:01:08.150 --> 06:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you it's nice to be back I'm

06:01:49.310 --> 06:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon chairman for the
 
06:01:51.110 --> 06:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
record my name is Bill Watson
 
06:01:52.730 --> 06:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator in the Bureau of
 
06:01:54.288 --> 06:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
planning and Community Assistance at the
 
06:01:56.288 --> 06:01:56.298 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to be here with our assistant
 
06:02:01.788 --> 06:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner Dave rodrigue between the
 
06:02:03.230 --> 06:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
two of us hopefully we can answer any
 
06:02:05.628 --> 06:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
questions that might come up thank you a
 
06:02:08.570 --> 06:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
pleasure to have you also
 
06:02:08.580 --> 06:02:09.288 align:start position:0%
pleasure to have you also
um

06:02:09.288 --> 06:02:09.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:11.868 --> 06:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
so there is written testimony
 
06:02:13.970 --> 06:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
signed by myself on behalf of the
 
06:02:16.490 --> 06:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
department that talks to the bill
 
06:02:19.448 --> 06:02:19.458 align:start position:0%
as it was presented
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
we are
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 511 FN as
 
06:02:27.708 --> 06:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
it's written
 
06:02:29.690 --> 06:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
there is a couple of technical issues
 
06:02:31.368 --> 06:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
06:02:34.670 --> 06:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
that I'll get into momentarily Deputy
 
06:02:36.288 --> 06:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Brier was here earlier to
 
06:02:37.730 --> 06:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
talk about a different bill
 
06:02:40.250 --> 06:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
and our opposition to the bill doesn't
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
mean that we're in opposition of
 
06:02:44.030 --> 06:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
complete streets approaches to
 
06:02:46.490 --> 06:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
transportation we are a multimodal
 
06:02:46.500 --> 06:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
transportation we are a multimodal
agency

06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
agency
 
06:02:51.048 --> 06:02:51.058 align:start position:0%
whether that is vehicle or pedestrian or
 
06:02:55.490 --> 06:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
bicycle Transit rail air whatever that
 
06:02:57.890 --> 06:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
mode is we are a multimodal agency and
 
06:03:00.048 --> 06:03:00.058 align:start position:0%
we are in support of implementing
 
06:03:02.330 --> 06:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
capital projects that that meet those
 
06:03:03.890 --> 06:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
needs and meet those desires throughout
 
06:03:07.070 --> 06:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.750 --> 06:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I've been with the state for just
 
06:03:10.970 --> 06:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
06:03:16.910 --> 06:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
when I first started we got into this
 
06:03:16.920 --> 06:03:18.410 align:start position:0%
when I first started we got into this
um

06:03:18.410 --> 06:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
program or effort of what we called
 
06:03:22.788 --> 06:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
context sensitive Solutions
 
06:03:25.208 --> 06:03:25.218 align:start position:0%
context sensitive designs
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably a precursor to what people call
 
06:03:30.410 --> 06:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
complete streets today
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the approach that that represented
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
is simply this we work with a community
 
06:03:40.368 --> 06:03:40.378 align:start position:0%
we listen to them we spend a lot of time
 
06:03:43.010 --> 06:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
with them more time on some projects
 
06:03:44.628 --> 06:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
than others depending on the complexity
 
06:03:47.690 --> 06:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
depending on the work that's proposed to
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
understand what their needs are to
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
understand what their wants are
 
06:03:54.910 --> 06:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
and then we try to develop
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
strategies to meet their needs within
 
06:03:59.930 --> 06:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
the constraints that we have sometimes
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
those constraints are physical
 
06:04:03.230 --> 06:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
how much roadway with do you have to
 
06:04:04.368 --> 06:04:04.378 align:start position:0%
work with it goes to some of the
 
06:04:05.810 --> 06:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked maybe of
 
06:04:08.330 --> 06:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
previous previous people that were
 
06:04:10.010 --> 06:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
sitting in this chair
 
06:04:13.510 --> 06:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
um it also goes to financial constraints
 
06:04:15.948 --> 06:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
operations maintenance in the long term
 
06:04:15.958 --> 06:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
operations maintenance in the long term
Etc

06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:19.440 --> 06:04:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:04:21.350 --> 06:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's something we've been doing
 
06:04:26.628 --> 06:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
for years and and we have that approach
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
we are committed to following that
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
approach with all of our projects that
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
we fund and are involved with
 
06:04:36.890 --> 06:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
specifically to the opposition to this
 
06:04:38.510 --> 06:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
bill I mentioned a couple of technical
 
06:04:42.650 --> 06:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
issues I mentioned two in the letter
 
06:04:42.660 --> 06:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
issues I mentioned two in the letter
um

06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:43.920 --> 06:04:45.590 align:start position:0%
um
one

06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:04:47.810 --> 06:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
I think their need there we would
 
06:04:49.730 --> 06:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
recommend a correction if this bill were
 
06:04:51.890 --> 06:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
to move forward we can't find that
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's a National Association of City
 
06:04:55.368 --> 06:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
traffic officials
 
06:04:58.128 --> 06:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
or any documents to that that they would
 
06:05:00.048 --> 06:05:00.058 align:start position:0%
represent there is a National
 
06:05:02.208 --> 06:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
Association of city transportation
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
officials and unfortunately there are
 
06:05:06.650 --> 06:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire cities
 
06:05:09.230 --> 06:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
or towns represented as part of that
 
06:05:09.240 --> 06:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
or towns represented as part of that
group

06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:05:12.830 --> 06:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
so what is being proposed in legislation
 
06:05:15.230 --> 06:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
is that we are asked to adopt standards
 
06:05:16.670 --> 06:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
and guidelines
 
06:05:18.530 --> 06:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
that know
 
06:05:21.530 --> 06:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
city or town in New Hampshire
 
06:05:24.590 --> 06:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
has already bought into
 
06:05:31.730 --> 06:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we see in the
 
06:05:36.048 --> 06:05:36.058 align:start position:0%
legislation is that there needs to be
 
06:05:38.570 --> 06:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
coordination there's reference in the
 
06:05:40.730 --> 06:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
legislation to complete streets advisory
 
06:05:40.740 --> 06:05:42.890 align:start position:0%
legislation to complete streets advisory
committee

06:05:42.890 --> 06:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:05:42.900 --> 06:05:45.250 align:start position:0%
committee
um

06:05:45.250 --> 06:05:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
reading the legislation in its entirety
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is reference to RSA 22849
 
06:05:54.650 --> 06:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
and and functions of the Department of
 
06:05:56.750 --> 06:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation and how that fits into
 
06:05:59.030 --> 06:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repairs and such I think
 
06:06:00.230 --> 06:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's been a few I know there's been a
 
06:06:02.868 --> 06:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
few questions as it relates to that
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
um in that same context we have a
 
06:06:07.670 --> 06:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
complete streets advisory committee
 
06:06:09.530 --> 06:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
within a department it's our
 
06:06:11.390 --> 06:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
understanding as we read the legislation
 
06:06:13.430 --> 06:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
that every project that would be coming
 
06:06:15.650 --> 06:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
forward would have to be reviewed by
 
06:06:17.208 --> 06:06:17.218 align:start position:0%
that complete speech advisory committee
 
06:06:19.250 --> 06:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
within our department
 
06:06:19.260 --> 06:06:20.208 align:start position:0%
within our department
um

06:06:20.208 --> 06:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:23.030 --> 06:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's a something that
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
we fear is is will bring a lot of work
 
06:06:29.448 --> 06:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
that we're not prepared for for an
 
06:06:31.250 --> 06:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that's both staffed
 
06:06:32.990 --> 06:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department as well as external
 
06:06:35.510 --> 06:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers that didn't intend to be part
 
06:06:38.510 --> 06:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
of that sort of process
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
so those are the two technical items
 
06:06:43.730 --> 06:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
that we saw with the bill I think the
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
third that I would add separate from
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
what's in the written testimony
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
is that there is the overall question
 
06:06:49.920 --> 06:06:52.070 align:start position:0%
is that there is the overall question
about

06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:06:55.190 --> 06:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
um if this language as proposed really
 
06:06:57.730 --> 06:06:57.740 align:start position:0%
fits into RSA 22849
 
06:07:00.288 --> 06:07:00.298 align:start position:0%
is this really about the Department of
 
06:07:04.250 --> 06:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
Transportation being involved RSA 22849
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
in a general sense is
 
06:07:08.810 --> 06:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
um giving the department the
 
06:07:09.890 --> 06:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
06:07:11.990 --> 06:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation the authority to do
 
06:07:13.788 --> 06:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
repairs and maintenance of roadways on
 
06:07:15.650 --> 06:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
behalf of communities and municipalities
 
06:07:18.110 --> 06:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that from what I've
 
06:07:19.970 --> 06:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
heard and what I've read that that's
 
06:07:23.570 --> 06:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
really the intent of what's being
 
06:07:27.770 --> 06:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
um questions to the committee
 
06:07:36.470 --> 06:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:07:38.930 --> 06:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'm going to follow up a question I
 
06:07:41.810 --> 06:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
asked earlier uh it seems to be a more
 
06:07:41.820 --> 06:07:43.010 align:start position:0%
asked earlier uh it seems to be a more
appropriate

06:07:43.010 --> 06:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
06:07:45.708 --> 06:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
place to ask the question in the lane
 
06:07:48.590 --> 06:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
with as you start to shrink these Lanes
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
down it was referred to as
 
06:07:55.970 --> 06:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
a calming effect of the speed of the
 
06:07:57.948 --> 06:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
vehicles and
 
06:08:02.390 --> 06:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:04.788 --> 06:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
I guess that works in theory but in
 
06:08:07.190 --> 06:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
reality do we find that that actually
 
06:08:10.850 --> 06:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
works by shrinking the lanes down where
 
06:08:13.548 --> 06:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
the cars are growing bigger and you got
 
06:08:16.610 --> 06:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
bigger trucks and bigger things is that
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
a safe way of doing things by shrinking
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:23.760 --> 06:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:08:29.090 --> 06:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee my
 
06:08:30.948 --> 06:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
name's David rodrigue I'm the assistant
 
06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation shrinking the lanes down
 
06:08:39.048 --> 06:08:39.058 align:start position:0%
is a strategy that the department uses
 
06:08:42.288 --> 06:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
in some cases to do exactly what you're
 
06:08:45.890 --> 06:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
describing to calm the traffic our
 
06:08:49.368 --> 06:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
typical Lane width is 12 foot wide we
 
06:08:53.090 --> 06:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
will go down to 11 and sometimes a
 
06:08:57.048 --> 06:08:57.058 align:start position:0%
little bit narrower than 11 but we get
 
06:08:59.930 --> 06:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
very concerned when we start talking
 
06:09:03.470 --> 06:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
about whiffs below 10 and a half feet
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so forth so we do shrink Lanes as a
 
06:09:10.368 --> 06:09:10.378 align:start position:0%
way of calming traffic but we have
 
06:09:13.670 --> 06:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
limits to the extent that that we will
 
06:09:17.330 --> 06:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
reduce those lines Lane whips thank you
 
06:09:20.810 --> 06:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
yes please representative thank you Mr
 
06:09:22.070 --> 06:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:09:25.730 --> 06:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
question if this legislation was passed
 
06:09:29.090 --> 06:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
do you feel that it could sometimes
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
really slow down what you guys are
 
06:09:33.410 --> 06:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
trying to do because now you've got to
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
get a hold of these organizations and
 
06:09:35.400 --> 06:09:36.530 align:start position:0%
get a hold of these organizations and
people

06:09:36.530 --> 06:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:09:39.048 --> 06:09:39.058 align:start position:0%
and then you've got to maybe explain to
 
06:09:40.430 --> 06:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
them why you're doing what you're doing
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
when you know what you're doing because
 
06:09:46.070 --> 06:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
the D.O.T does a great job in my opinion
 
06:09:49.070 --> 06:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
but thank thank you for that
 
06:09:52.490 --> 06:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
um I do want to address that the the RSA
 
06:09:55.250 --> 06:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
that this legislation
 
06:09:59.288 --> 06:09:59.298 align:start position:0%
um proposes to change that is RSA
 
06:09:59.298 --> 06:10:00.850 align:start position:0%
um proposes to change that is RSA
228.49

06:10:00.850 --> 06:10:00.860 align:start position:0%
228.49
 
06:10:00.860 --> 06:10:02.650 align:start position:0%
228.49
RSA

06:10:02.650 --> 06:10:02.660 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
228.49 is requested maintenance and
 
06:10:09.530 --> 06:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
repair projects the truth is the
 
06:10:10.750 --> 06:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
06:10:13.730 --> 06:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
particularly with our current Staffing
 
06:10:16.850 --> 06:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
levels but at all times does very little
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
work under this statute what this statue
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
allows is communities to ask the
 
06:10:27.708 --> 06:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
department with our forces in equipment
 
06:10:31.670 --> 06:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth to come in and help a town
 
06:10:35.330 --> 06:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
do a project the department is not
 
06:10:39.230 --> 06:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
currently set up to do this type of work
 
06:10:41.628 --> 06:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
um the last time that I can think of
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
that we used it was during an ice storm
 
06:10:47.390 --> 06:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the town of them first when there
 
06:10:49.970 --> 06:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
were lots of trees down lots of road
 
06:10:53.150 --> 06:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
closed school was closed for days and
 
06:10:55.730 --> 06:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
the department was asked to come in and
 
06:10:59.330 --> 06:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
help to clear some of the debris and we
 
06:11:02.090 --> 06:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
used this statute to do that that work
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
we don't normally on a year to year do
 
06:11:07.910 --> 06:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
do work under this statute for
 
06:11:10.850 --> 06:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
communities I think the spirit of this
 
06:11:14.330 --> 06:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
bill would like to say anytime we
 
06:11:17.150 --> 06:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
resurface a road or come into a
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
community to do work on a state road
 
06:11:23.628 --> 06:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
that we follow these contact sensitive
 
06:11:27.770 --> 06:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
design guidelines and and so forth our
 
06:11:31.010 --> 06:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
our resurfacing program is very
 
06:11:34.250 --> 06:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
streamlined these these days we do as
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
little ancillary work in those projects
 
06:11:40.490 --> 06:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
as possible so that we can pave as many
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
miles as possible so that we can improve
 
06:11:45.948 --> 06:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
the condition of our roadways we've been
 
06:11:48.830 --> 06:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
very focused on that for the last eight
 
06:11:51.770 --> 06:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
to ten years and thanks to additional
 
06:11:56.030 --> 06:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
funding that was passed in SB 367 we've
 
06:11:58.750 --> 06:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
made great progress on
 
06:12:01.910 --> 06:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
improving pavement conditions in our
 
06:12:04.910 --> 06:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
roadways so if this was passed in its
 
06:12:07.490 --> 06:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
Spirit it would mean any of those
 
06:12:10.368 --> 06:12:10.378 align:start position:0%
routine maintenance projects where we're
 
06:12:13.310 --> 06:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
coming in to to pave with some
 
06:12:13.320 --> 06:12:15.288 align:start position:0%
coming in to to pave with some
efficiency

06:12:15.288 --> 06:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
06:12:17.930 --> 06:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
um would it would slow down the process
 
06:12:20.930 --> 06:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
and it would create more discussion and
 
06:12:23.628 --> 06:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
preparation of those projects and if
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
additional work was included
 
06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
um would take funds from that
 
06:12:30.170 --> 06:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
resurfacing work
 
06:12:31.670 --> 06:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:33.948 --> 06:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
um I think that was clear
 
06:12:36.470 --> 06:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh repsham Jack uh thank you Mr chairman
 
06:12:38.330 --> 06:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh so if I understood what you just said
 
06:12:40.430 --> 06:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
even if we thought this was a good idea
 
06:12:42.230 --> 06:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's a major drafting error in that
 
06:12:44.570 --> 06:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
it amends the wrong RSA in your opinion
 
06:12:47.628 --> 06:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
in my opinion there is
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
thank you a further question yes
 
06:12:53.510 --> 06:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:56.330 --> 06:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
William on paragraph two of the letter
 
06:12:58.970 --> 06:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
it talks about collaboration with local
 
06:12:58.980 --> 06:13:00.170 align:start position:0%
it talks about collaboration with local
officials

06:13:00.170 --> 06:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
officials
 
06:13:03.890 --> 06:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
for uh coordinating uh what they might
 
06:13:05.810 --> 06:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
want for those who live and work and
 
06:13:10.010 --> 06:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
travel and you know in in that town
 
06:13:12.288 --> 06:13:12.298 align:start position:0%
how does that differ from the intended
 
06:13:12.298 --> 06:13:14.090 align:start position:0%
how does that differ from the intended
legislation

06:13:14.090 --> 06:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:13:16.490 --> 06:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
if it sounds like you're you're going to
 
06:13:19.548 --> 06:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
work with them anyway to to downtown
 
06:13:22.610 --> 06:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's a state road they want complete
 
06:13:26.090 --> 06:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
streets you're saying you you do this
 
06:13:30.650 --> 06:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
so just for clarification purposes
 
06:13:30.660 --> 06:13:31.490 align:start position:0%
so just for clarification purposes
um

06:13:31.490 --> 06:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:32.930 --> 06:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner just
 
06:13:35.090 --> 06:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
identified a couple of scenarios so we
 
06:13:36.890 --> 06:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
have the Amherst ice storm scenario
 
06:13:40.368 --> 06:13:40.378 align:start position:0%
which we believe that RSA 22849
 
06:13:42.410 --> 06:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
really applies to
 
06:13:44.750 --> 06:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
we have the routine maintenance and
 
06:13:47.868 --> 06:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
resurfacing type of work that we do
 
06:13:50.690 --> 06:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
that we try to be as efficient and
 
06:13:53.208 --> 06:13:53.218 align:start position:0%
stretch those dollars as far as we can
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have our Capital program our
 
06:13:57.770 --> 06:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that that you will all see
 
06:13:59.390 --> 06:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
as part of Public Works and highways
 
06:14:01.490 --> 06:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
that that many know about that includes
 
06:14:03.948 --> 06:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
all of our federal and state and local
 
06:14:05.868 --> 06:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
funded projects that that come through
 
06:14:09.530 --> 06:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
the the the gaset and legislative and
 
06:14:11.930 --> 06:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
Governor's process in all of those
 
06:14:13.970 --> 06:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
projects that the department is involved
 
06:14:16.010 --> 06:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
with yes we are having public
 
06:14:17.628 --> 06:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
informational meetings we are having
 
06:14:19.910 --> 06:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
public officials meetings if we are
 
06:14:22.670 --> 06:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
doing a project in a downtown area in
 
06:14:23.930 --> 06:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
many cases
 
06:14:25.970 --> 06:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
the town is managing that project
 
06:14:27.650 --> 06:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
themselves and has the lead management
 
06:14:30.770 --> 06:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
role my office my Bureau we have over
 
06:14:33.230 --> 06:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
400 million dollars worth of locally
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
driven projects ongoing in a 10-year
 
06:14:39.650 --> 06:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
plan right now where the towns if they
 
06:14:42.470 --> 06:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
have complete speech policies are
 
06:14:42.480 --> 06:14:44.048 align:start position:0%
have complete speech policies are
already

06:14:44.048 --> 06:14:44.058 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:14:46.070 --> 06:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
applying those complete streets
 
06:14:48.288 --> 06:14:48.298 align:start position:0%
approaches or those policies to the
 
06:14:49.970 --> 06:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
projects that we are involved with in
 
06:14:49.980 --> 06:14:51.048 align:start position:0%
projects that we are involved with in
funding

06:14:51.048 --> 06:14:51.058 align:start position:0%
funding
 
06:14:53.330 --> 06:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
but from day one on those projects that
 
06:14:55.850 --> 06:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
are in the capital program this is the
 
06:14:57.410 --> 06:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
approach that we are already supporting
 
06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
and have been for as long as I can
 
06:15:02.270 --> 06:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
remember in the department and that's
 
06:15:04.190 --> 06:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
I can't remember back to day one 30
 
06:15:08.570 --> 06:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:12.708 --> 06:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
06:15:17.628 --> 06:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question
 
06:15:21.470 --> 06:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 it was a committee that met
 
06:15:22.970 --> 06:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
in fact two of the individuals that are
 
06:15:25.250 --> 06:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
sitting here were on that committee and
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
it had to do with this uh a lot of it
 
06:15:28.910 --> 06:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
had to do with the complete Street
 
06:15:30.530 --> 06:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
program and there were several
 
06:15:33.048 --> 06:15:33.058 align:start position:0%
recommendations were made and from what
 
06:15:35.150 --> 06:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
you just described what you do maybe you
 
06:15:36.650 --> 06:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
don't need these recommendations or
 
06:15:38.390 --> 06:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
maybe they would maybe they were taken
 
06:15:38.400 --> 06:15:39.110 align:start position:0%
maybe they would maybe they were taken
but

06:15:39.110 --> 06:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:15:41.330 --> 06:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
one of them was uh create a more
 
06:15:43.548 --> 06:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
formalized criteria to help prioritize
 
06:15:45.170 --> 06:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
complete streets related project
 
06:15:45.180 --> 06:15:47.150 align:start position:0%
complete streets related project
applications

06:15:47.150 --> 06:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
applications
 
06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea if that was done or
 
06:15:50.690 --> 06:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
do that's just your standard operating
 
06:15:53.530 --> 06:15:53.540 align:start position:0%
procedure there is not a set aside
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
program for complete streets projects
 
06:15:59.208 --> 06:15:59.218 align:start position:0%
complete streets projects could be
 
06:16:00.890 --> 06:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
funded through
 
06:16:02.990 --> 06:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
a dozen different Federal funding
 
06:16:05.150 --> 06:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
sources or other funding sources that we
 
06:16:06.770 --> 06:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
we work with and deal with on a regular
 
06:16:09.230 --> 06:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
basis it's just part of our process it's
 
06:16:11.570 --> 06:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
part of what we're we're trained and
 
06:16:13.730 --> 06:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
hired to do
 
06:16:15.470 --> 06:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay thanks though I want to ask you
 
06:16:17.090 --> 06:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
about the two other recommendations then
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
06:16:26.208 --> 06:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
questions yes please represent Bart it's
 
06:16:30.110 --> 06:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
just a clarification question uh based
 
06:16:33.410 --> 06:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
on your previous answer not to this
 
06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
question the one previous to that one
 
06:16:36.240 --> 06:16:38.090 align:start position:0%
question the one previous to that one
um

06:16:38.090 --> 06:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:40.970 --> 06:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
should this kind of stuff be going to
 
06:16:42.770 --> 06:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan is what I'm
 
06:16:44.930 --> 06:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
understanding you're saying when they
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
have a major project that's not just a
 
06:16:50.030 --> 06:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
resurfacing and stuff that maybe that
 
06:16:52.010 --> 06:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
should be addressed on a 10-year plan
 
06:16:54.590 --> 06:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
and not on your maintenance plan is that
 
06:16:57.490 --> 06:16:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:00.890 --> 06:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
from my perspective and my opinion our
 
06:17:04.610 --> 06:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
maintenance programs are intended to to
 
06:17:07.368 --> 06:17:07.378 align:start position:0%
do just that maintain what is their
 
06:17:10.250 --> 06:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
and and keep those roads and those
 
06:17:12.470 --> 06:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
bridges in service and as good a
 
06:17:15.350 --> 06:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
condition as possible I do believe that
 
06:17:17.288 --> 06:17:17.298 align:start position:0%
complete streets approach
 
06:17:19.368 --> 06:17:19.378 align:start position:0%
context-sensitive approach to projects
 
06:17:21.048 --> 06:17:21.058 align:start position:0%
that are in a 10-year plan
 
06:17:24.970 --> 06:17:24.980 align:start position:0%
are appropriate to discuss in all cases
 
06:17:27.948 --> 06:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
and with coordination with the towns
 
06:17:30.830 --> 06:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
then you can determine which of those
 
06:17:30.840 --> 06:17:32.030 align:start position:0%
then you can determine which of those
components

06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
components
 
06:17:34.070 --> 06:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
our best to be implemented given the
 
06:17:37.390 --> 06:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:41.930 --> 06:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
if I may yes please if I may to to
 
06:17:44.990 --> 06:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
follow up I I do want to be clear even
 
06:17:48.410 --> 06:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
our resurfacing program we have maps on
 
06:17:51.830 --> 06:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
our websites that show where we plan to
 
06:17:54.590 --> 06:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
resurface and so forth and if
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
communities bring changes to us in lane
 
06:18:00.288 --> 06:18:00.298 align:start position:0%
whiffs and so forth they would like us
 
06:18:02.628 --> 06:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
to consider as part of that work we are
 
06:18:05.448 --> 06:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
certainly open to to that communication
 
06:18:08.868 --> 06:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
and we work to to let people know where
 
06:18:11.330 --> 06:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're coming and when we'll be there so
 
06:18:14.570 --> 06:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
that we can have those discussions
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:20.750 --> 06:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you chair real quick thank
 
06:18:23.770 --> 06:18:23.780 align:start position:0%
you what so in in your in your efforts
 
06:18:28.190 --> 06:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
if if the if the town asks for a
 
06:18:31.250 --> 06:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
a bike lane or an extended sidewalk or a
 
06:18:33.530 --> 06:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
bump out that's not your purview
 
06:18:35.150 --> 06:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily going to
 
06:18:39.708 --> 06:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:41.868 --> 06:18:41.878 align:start position:0%
again it depends on the circumstances of
 
06:18:43.430 --> 06:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
the project
 
06:18:44.930 --> 06:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
um a bump out
 
06:18:46.970 --> 06:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
our maintenance if that is a roadway
 
06:18:48.708 --> 06:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
that our our Highway Maintenance
 
06:18:50.448 --> 06:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
districts are responsible for
 
06:18:52.850 --> 06:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
maintaining they're going to encourage
 
06:18:55.730 --> 06:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
us to try to accommodate that Crossing
 
06:18:57.470 --> 06:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
that what that bump out is trying to
 
06:18:59.390 --> 06:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
achieve perhaps in some other way or
 
06:19:00.890 --> 06:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
they need to change their their
 
06:19:02.930 --> 06:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
maintenance their plowing Arrangements a
 
06:19:05.330 --> 06:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
little bit if a town asks for a sidewalk
 
06:19:07.610 --> 06:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
as part of a project we will try to
 
06:19:08.930 --> 06:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
accommodate them and we will make sure
 
06:19:10.430 --> 06:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's a local agreement in place so
 
06:19:12.708 --> 06:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
that when that sidewalk is completed the
 
06:19:14.150 --> 06:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
town takes over the maintenance and
 
06:19:17.330 --> 06:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
operations responsibility for that
 
06:19:19.750 --> 06:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
um but it's as part of a larger project
 
06:19:22.128 --> 06:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
or depending on some of our federal
 
06:19:25.010 --> 06:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
programs there are Standalone sidewalker
 
06:19:27.770 --> 06:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
stand-alone Trail projects that can that
 
06:19:30.770 --> 06:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:32.270 --> 06:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:35.330 --> 06:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
I I'm starting to feel like we're talked
 
06:19:37.070 --> 06:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
out here is there anyone else who would
 
06:19:39.470 --> 06:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
like one more question
 
06:19:42.190 --> 06:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen thank you
 
06:19:46.250 --> 06:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
my last speaker is representative Horgan
 
06:19:49.490 --> 06:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to uh before I
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
bring you up
 
06:19:54.350 --> 06:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh we have some folks on the other side
 
06:19:58.490 --> 06:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
in room 203 that are setting up office
 
06:20:02.030 --> 06:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
have drinks and so forth when you leave
 
06:20:04.070 --> 06:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
will you please make sure that your
 
06:20:07.010 --> 06:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
furniture goes back to where it was and
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
all drinks are taken with you when you
 
06:20:11.270 --> 06:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
leave the room thank you representative
 
06:20:13.490 --> 06:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
horian I'd like to recognize you you
 
06:20:16.910 --> 06:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
have you have written testimony here and
 
06:20:19.610 --> 06:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
your first line is I could go on for a
 
06:20:21.770 --> 06:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
long time about complete streams they've
 
06:20:23.628 --> 06:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
already done so I well I thank you I'm
 
06:20:25.070 --> 06:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horrigan from
 
06:20:28.368 --> 06:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
dropper County District 10 and um
 
06:20:30.410 --> 06:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
my original expectation was a few days
 
06:20:31.730 --> 06:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
ago that
 
06:20:33.590 --> 06:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
um Reverend McWilliams was going to be
 
06:20:35.448 --> 06:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
unable to attend the hearing and happily
 
06:20:38.628 --> 06:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
she was and then representative van we
 
06:20:40.010 --> 06:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
weren't sure whether or not she could
 
06:20:42.288 --> 06:20:42.298 align:start position:0%
come and she came so uh you know they
 
06:20:43.970 --> 06:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
maybe explained what a complete street
 
06:20:47.448 --> 06:20:47.458 align:start position:0%
is it's a street that uh serves them
 
06:20:50.810 --> 06:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
serves everyone and I cited an example I
 
06:20:52.490 --> 06:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
said it was a good example the expert
 
06:20:54.650 --> 06:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
said it was more of a not bad example or
 
06:20:57.230 --> 06:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
a pretty good example which is a Main
 
06:20:59.448 --> 06:20:59.458 align:start position:0%
Street in Concord and I'm sure we're all
 
06:21:01.548 --> 06:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
those of us who serve weren't a couple
 
06:21:03.530 --> 06:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
of terms we'll also remember when it was
 
06:21:06.470 --> 06:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
extensively renovated um using a lot of
 
06:21:08.030 --> 06:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
the complete Street principles although
 
06:21:09.410 --> 06:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
there's a few things missing like it
 
06:21:12.110 --> 06:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a separate bike lane but
 
06:21:13.910 --> 06:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's a I mean it was a pretty good
 
06:21:15.470 --> 06:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
pedestrian friendly space even before
 
06:21:18.830 --> 06:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
the end result is uh like is superb it's
 
06:21:21.650 --> 06:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
quite it's quite nice and then on the
 
06:21:23.448 --> 06:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
opposite what just I made of the term of
 
06:21:24.890 --> 06:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
an incomplete Street a good example
 
06:21:27.890 --> 06:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
might be Loudon Road in Concord and both
 
06:21:29.930 --> 06:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
Main Street and Loudon Road are also
 
06:21:32.390 --> 06:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
State highways um
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:21:36.590 --> 06:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
ironically uh makes me I think it's
 
06:21:39.048 --> 06:21:39.058 align:start position:0%
actually easier to drive up the length
 
06:21:40.670 --> 06:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
of Main Street than Loudoun Road even
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
though Loudon Road was pretty design
 
06:21:44.810 --> 06:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
thinking only of the motor vehicles you
 
06:21:46.070 --> 06:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
know they have a few perfunctory
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
sidewalks and so forth but
 
06:21:50.330 --> 06:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I think it's actually even though
 
06:21:52.548 --> 06:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
it's probably slower I think it's
 
06:21:54.170 --> 06:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
actually easier to drive up Main Street
 
06:21:57.110 --> 06:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's less stressful it's more uh it's
 
06:21:58.250 --> 06:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
more more
 
06:22:00.350 --> 06:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's more orderly it's just generally a
 
06:22:01.970 --> 06:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
better driving experience at least in my
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
opinion and um these three programs they
 
06:22:06.948 --> 06:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
talked about there is a commission and I
 
06:22:08.030 --> 06:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
figured that would administer the
 
06:22:09.650 --> 06:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
program that the Department of
 
06:22:12.110 --> 06:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh I guess disagreed with
 
06:22:13.548 --> 06:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
that point so that's something you'll
 
06:22:14.810 --> 06:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
have to work out
 
06:22:16.788 --> 06:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
but it
 
06:22:19.670 --> 06:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
um at least the rudiments of of a
 
06:22:22.610 --> 06:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
program of a the program are in place
 
06:22:22.620 --> 06:22:23.448 align:start position:0%
program of a the program are in place
um

06:22:23.448 --> 06:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:26.390 --> 06:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
one thing I will admit it uh
 
06:22:28.670 --> 06:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
it does you know it demands more the
 
06:22:30.830 --> 06:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
bare minimum you know we're not going to
 
06:22:33.288 --> 06:22:33.298 align:start position:0%
do it's demands we do things with more
 
06:22:34.670 --> 06:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts and just the quickest and
 
06:22:37.910 --> 06:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
cheapest way to do it and uh that may
 
06:22:39.230 --> 06:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
seem at odds with the New Hampshire way
 
06:22:42.110 --> 06:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
but also New Hampshire has dozens maybe
 
06:22:44.810 --> 06:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
hundreds of beautiful Villages towns and
 
06:22:47.570 --> 06:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
cities of various sizes and um
 
06:22:49.788 --> 06:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
some of them are world famous tourist
 
06:22:51.650 --> 06:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
attractions um
 
06:22:53.150 --> 06:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
and their Central districts were all
 
06:22:54.470 --> 06:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
designed to be fairly pedestrian
 
06:22:56.810 --> 06:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
friendly and to serve a wide variety of
 
06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
uses in a compact space and uh
 
06:23:01.490 --> 06:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'd say they're pretty close to what we
 
06:23:03.288 --> 06:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
now refer to as complete streets the
 
06:23:06.610 --> 06:23:06.620 align:start position:0%
classic New England Town Center so
 
06:23:09.288 --> 06:23:09.298 align:start position:0%
we act we're actually my opinion we're
 
06:23:11.448 --> 06:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
probably going back to the way we did
 
06:23:13.610 --> 06:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
things back in the quote unquote good
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
old days so that's um
 
06:23:17.510 --> 06:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I think this is oh and one
 
06:23:18.470 --> 06:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
thing we're talking about the length of
 
06:23:20.330 --> 06:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
the width so I just happen to like do a
 
06:23:22.430 --> 06:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
little quick Googling there actually is
 
06:23:24.830 --> 06:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
a set width for the maximum width of a
 
06:23:26.390 --> 06:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle that can go in the highway so
 
06:23:28.128 --> 06:23:28.138 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
06:23:30.530 --> 06:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's 102 inches so that's eight
 
06:23:32.628 --> 06:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
feet six inches so I guess school buses
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
are uh can be up to nine feet so like a
 
06:23:37.010 --> 06:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
10 foot travel Lane is enough to
 
06:23:38.390 --> 06:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
accommodate just about anything that
 
06:23:40.730 --> 06:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
goes down the highway without like a
 
06:23:43.128 --> 06:23:43.138 align:start position:0%
whole lot of trouble so thank you thank
 
06:23:45.288 --> 06:23:45.298 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
06:24:52.548 --> 06:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
my name is Jackie groda I'm a
 
06:24:55.810 --> 06:24:55.820 align:start position:0%
representative rep from Rockingham 24
 
06:24:58.788 --> 06:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Rye in
 
06:24:58.798 --> 06:25:01.070 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Rye in
Greenland

06:25:01.070 --> 06:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
Greenland
 
06:25:04.010 --> 06:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
my in my previous District I also I
 
06:25:06.170 --> 06:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
represented the towns of rye and
 
06:25:09.048 --> 06:25:09.058 align:start position:0%
Newcastle so I'm familiar with my
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
previous District as well
 
06:25:16.190 --> 06:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 361 came about as a request
 
06:25:18.708 --> 06:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
from the town from our my constituents
 
06:25:21.170 --> 06:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
and the select board as well as the
 
06:25:24.110 --> 06:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
select board from Newcastle
 
06:25:26.090 --> 06:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
when the peace Development Authority was
 
06:25:29.570 --> 06:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
first developed was first implemented
 
06:25:33.470 --> 06:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
the area of the PDA was defined to the
 
06:25:37.548 --> 06:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
area that we know now as the piece of
 
06:25:37.558 --> 06:25:40.970 align:start position:0%
area that we know now as the piece of
airport

06:25:40.970 --> 06:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:40.980 --> 06:25:41.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:25:41.628 --> 06:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:43.490 --> 06:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
the trade port
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
and since that time Harbors had been
 
06:25:49.310 --> 06:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
added to the responsibility of the peace
 
06:25:52.430 --> 06:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:56.208 --> 06:25:56.218 align:start position:0%
because Rye is contiguous now with at
 
06:25:57.350 --> 06:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
the towns that were part of that were
 
06:26:00.948 --> 06:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
represented on the peace Development
 
06:26:03.230 --> 06:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
Authority were those towns that were
 
06:26:05.628 --> 06:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
contiguous with what is now known as
 
06:26:07.788 --> 06:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
pre-piece trade forth
 
06:26:10.788 --> 06:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
there was no representation for towns
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
that were now part of the that were
 
06:26:15.470 --> 06:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
contiguous with the harbors
 
06:26:17.810 --> 06:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
so the town of Newcastle you may have
 
06:26:19.910 --> 06:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
you will have received a letter early
 
06:26:22.788 --> 06:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
from the select Board of Newcastle
 
06:26:26.510 --> 06:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
because the naval base is is contiguous
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
with Newcastle and the Rye Harbor is
 
06:26:32.510 --> 06:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
contiguous with Rye
 
06:26:32.520 --> 06:26:33.650 align:start position:0%
contiguous with Rye
so

06:26:33.650 --> 06:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:26:36.170 --> 06:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
um originally this bill was asking for
 
06:26:38.390 --> 06:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
representation on the peace development
 
06:26:38.400 --> 06:26:39.230 align:start position:0%
representation on the peace development
board

06:26:39.230 --> 06:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
but we've I've submitted an amendment
 
06:26:47.270 --> 06:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
that is amendment I believe I sent it to
 
06:26:50.660 --> 06:26:50.670 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:50.670 --> 06:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:26:53.590 --> 06:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:26:55.788 --> 06:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
okay I have a copy of it would you like
 
06:26:58.010 --> 06:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
to see it would you like we need to have
 
06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment you can discuss the sort
 
06:27:02.270 --> 06:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
of things you might put on the
 
06:27:05.090 --> 06:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
Amendments yes okay that's right I'm
 
06:27:07.010 --> 06:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
asking the committee to consider this
 
06:27:09.530 --> 06:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
amendment no that's my point is we don't
 
06:27:11.810 --> 06:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
have a copy of your Amendment all right
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
let me uh let me just tell you what I
 
06:27:15.470 --> 06:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
would like to put on the amendment
 
06:27:15.480 --> 06:27:16.430 align:start position:0%
would like to put on the amendment
please

06:27:16.430 --> 06:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
please
 
06:27:19.970 --> 06:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
so rather than having the we're asking
 
06:27:22.730 --> 06:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to expand the board and
 
06:27:24.350 --> 06:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
change the membership because that's a
 
06:27:27.650 --> 06:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
very cumbersome process so we chose a
 
06:27:30.350 --> 06:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
position that exists now which is that
 
06:27:32.510 --> 06:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
member appointed by the Speaker of the
 
06:27:32.520 --> 06:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
member appointed by the Speaker of the
House

06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
House
 
06:27:37.190 --> 06:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
and what we would like to have is a
 
06:27:39.650 --> 06:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
reporting relationship with that member
 
06:27:43.070 --> 06:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
so that they can report to the towns of
 
06:27:46.250 --> 06:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
Ryan Newcastle on a regular basis the
 
06:27:48.170 --> 06:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
deliberations of the peace Development
 
06:27:48.180 --> 06:27:50.930 align:start position:0%
deliberations of the peace Development
Authority

06:27:50.930 --> 06:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:50.940 --> 06:27:52.250 align:start position:0%
 
I

06:27:52.250 --> 06:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:27:54.890 --> 06:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that let me just
 
06:27:56.270 --> 06:27:56.280 align:start position:0%

saying
 
06:27:59.810 --> 06:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
in your proposal you would not be
 
06:28:02.868 --> 06:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
looking to add a member to but you would
 
06:28:04.970 --> 06:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
ask that the member that is appointed
 
06:28:08.810 --> 06:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
now by the speaker would report on a
 
06:28:11.270 --> 06:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
regular basis the business that's before
 
06:28:11.280 --> 06:28:12.470 align:start position:0%

06:29:48.830 --> 06:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:50.990 --> 06:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for allowing Excuse Me Miss King
 
06:29:53.390 --> 06:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
are you in support of the proposed
 
06:29:55.788 --> 06:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
amendment or the original Bill the
 
06:29:58.910 --> 06:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
original Bill okay thank you go ahead
 
06:30:01.810 --> 06:30:01.820 align:start position:0%
um thanks for allowing us to speak today
 
06:30:05.390 --> 06:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
we believe that Ryan Newcastle should
 
06:30:08.510 --> 06:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
have a direct representation on the peas
 
06:30:10.850 --> 06:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
Development Authority board to ensure
 
06:30:13.208 --> 06:30:13.218 align:start position:0%
that we can be informed about policies
 
06:30:16.910 --> 06:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
projects that affect our towns in a in a
 
06:30:20.208 --> 06:30:20.218 align:start position:0%
timely fashion the lack of this uh
 
06:30:23.570 --> 06:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
direct representation we view is almost
 
06:30:25.788 --> 06:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
a historical accident due to the fact
 
06:30:28.310 --> 06:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
that the ports and harbors oversight was
 
06:30:31.910 --> 06:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
added after the fact and uh
 
06:30:35.510 --> 06:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and and was the representation was
 
06:30:37.548 --> 06:30:37.558 align:start position:0%
not really updated at that time to take
 
06:30:42.048 --> 06:30:42.058 align:start position:0%
into account those towns that were uh in
 
06:30:46.128 --> 06:30:46.138 align:start position:0%
which those Harbors uh resided we have
 
06:30:48.410 --> 06:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
seven of the harbors between rye and
 
06:30:51.350 --> 06:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
Newcastle and uh we think it's only fair
 
06:30:54.708 --> 06:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
to correct this uh situation at this
 
06:30:54.718 --> 06:30:56.270 align:start position:0%
to correct this uh situation at this
time

06:30:56.270 --> 06:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:30:56.280 --> 06:30:57.350 align:start position:0%
time
um

06:30:57.350 --> 06:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:00.948 --> 06:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
in Rye in particular were uh
 
06:31:04.670 --> 06:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
realizing the difficulty of uh dealing
 
06:31:04.680 --> 06:31:06.230 align:start position:0%
realizing the difficulty of uh dealing
with

06:31:06.230 --> 06:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:31:09.230 --> 06:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
policies that are from the peace
 
06:31:11.530 --> 06:31:11.540 align:start position:0%
Development Authority board
 
06:31:15.650 --> 06:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a seat at the table
 
06:31:18.110 --> 06:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
we just asked for the this ability so
 
06:31:20.390 --> 06:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we can properly uh represent our
 
06:31:20.400 --> 06:31:21.788 align:start position:0%
that we can properly uh represent our
constituents

06:31:21.788 --> 06:31:21.798 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
06:31:25.010 --> 06:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
so we do support the original bill as
 
06:31:25.020 --> 06:31:26.510 align:start position:0%
so we do support the original bill as
written

06:31:26.510 --> 06:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:31:29.090 --> 06:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you for letting me speak thank
 
06:31:31.628 --> 06:31:31.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr King is there any questions for
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
yes represent Mills
 
06:31:36.350 --> 06:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:31:38.448 --> 06:31:38.458 align:start position:0%
question so you say you support the
 
06:31:40.788 --> 06:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
original Bill what about the amendment
 
06:31:43.250 --> 06:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
as you heard it written or as you heard
 
06:31:46.010 --> 06:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
it spoken do you support the amendment
 
06:31:47.750 --> 06:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
which changes a little bit it doesn't
 
06:31:49.330 --> 06:31:49.340 align:start position:0%
give you a seat it gives you
 
06:31:51.530 --> 06:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
representation from a seat that already
 
06:31:53.030 --> 06:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
exists I think
 
06:31:55.730 --> 06:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
correct the original build is the same
 
06:31:57.890 --> 06:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
as the representation from a seat that
 
06:31:59.810 --> 06:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
06:32:03.850 --> 06:32:03.860 align:start position:0%
um my view of the amendment is that it
 
06:32:08.090 --> 06:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
deletes the requirement for or the of
 
06:32:11.750 --> 06:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
input of seeking our input this the
 
06:32:15.410 --> 06:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
amendment merely asked that we be report
 
06:32:18.470 --> 06:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
that deliberations are reported to US
 
06:32:23.090 --> 06:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
versus us having input to a member and
 
06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
so we would prefer the original Bill
 
06:32:28.250 --> 06:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:32:30.288 --> 06:32:30.298 align:start position:0%
further question
 
06:32:39.288 --> 06:32:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:44.708 --> 06:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize Matthews grutton
 
06:32:48.048 --> 06:32:48.058 align:start position:0%

welcome to Public Works
 
06:32:55.208 --> 06:32:55.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:57.890 --> 06:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
yeah there you go
 
06:33:00.530 --> 06:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
I apologize thank you good afternoon Mr
 
06:33:02.030 --> 06:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee my
 
06:33:03.350 --> 06:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
name is Matthew scrutin I'm the Town
 
06:33:05.570 --> 06:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
Administrator in Rye and I'm here today
 
06:33:10.128 --> 06:33:10.138 align:start position:0%
to support the original bill 361.
 
06:33:12.230 --> 06:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
um representative groda and select board
 
06:33:15.650 --> 06:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
member and vice chair Tom King have
 
06:33:17.150 --> 06:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
already reviewed a number of points that
 
06:33:19.190 --> 06:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
I agree with and support and I have
 
06:33:22.070 --> 06:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
submitted my written testimony so I
 
06:33:24.230 --> 06:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
won't go through it line by line but I'm
 
06:33:27.010 --> 06:33:27.020 align:start position:0%
here again to support the original Bill
 
06:33:29.448 --> 06:33:29.458 align:start position:0%
if there were to be an amendment I
 
06:33:31.150 --> 06:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
believe a town would want to make sure
 
06:33:36.110 --> 06:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
that the position the the board seat not
 
06:33:37.910 --> 06:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
only has the
 
06:33:37.920 --> 06:33:38.868 align:start position:0%
only has the
um

06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:42.590 --> 06:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
original uh or rather that the the town
 
06:33:44.570 --> 06:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
still can provide input to the board
 
06:33:46.850 --> 06:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
seat uh the way the amendment is written
 
06:33:49.730 --> 06:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
it it almost appears as if the amendment
 
06:33:52.250 --> 06:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
tries to take away the ability of the
 
06:33:55.250 --> 06:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
town to uh consult with and advise and
 
06:33:57.650 --> 06:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to that board seat
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear that the town is
 
06:34:01.490 --> 06:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
looking for somebody that they can go to
 
06:34:05.448 --> 06:34:05.458 align:start position:0%
with concerns uh and with questions uh
 
06:34:07.430 --> 06:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
they don't just want a
 
06:34:10.910 --> 06:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
report they want input so that's the
 
06:34:13.850 --> 06:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
point I think is important to make if
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment and that is what
 
06:34:17.708 --> 06:34:17.718 align:start position:0%
the town would desire
 
06:34:19.548 --> 06:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:19.558 --> 06:34:20.208 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:34:20.208 --> 06:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:23.930 --> 06:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh questions from the committee
 
06:34:25.910 --> 06:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
if if I could sir
 
06:34:28.368 --> 06:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
so limited knowledge on the Seacoast I
 
06:34:30.110 --> 06:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't think we have a lot of it so you
 
06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
got to put up with me further up north
 
06:34:38.288 --> 06:34:38.298 align:start position:0%
so the um we have the port in Portsmouth
 
06:34:43.490 --> 06:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
and does any part of that facility touch
 
06:34:47.030 --> 06:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
on to Rye Rye has a excellent question
 
06:34:50.048 --> 06:34:50.058 align:start position:0%
uh the Roy has Rye Harbor Little Harbor
 
06:34:52.330 --> 06:34:52.340 align:start position:0%
and gosport
 
06:34:54.650 --> 06:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
Newcastle has Goat Island Goat Island
 
06:34:58.010 --> 06:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
back Channel Hearts Cove and Portsmouth
 
06:34:59.628 --> 06:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
Yacht Club
 
06:35:01.490 --> 06:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I underst I
 
06:35:04.670 --> 06:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
understand that there are many Harbors
 
06:35:08.030 --> 06:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
in there but does does the peace
 
06:35:11.690 --> 06:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
Authority on the on that property does
 
06:35:14.690 --> 06:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
it it does not tie directly to
 
06:35:16.610 --> 06:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
your town
 
06:35:20.030 --> 06:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
only the the harbors um and if I'm if I
 
06:35:22.548 --> 06:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
may call upon selectman King if I'm
 
06:35:24.650 --> 06:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
mistaken but my understanding is that
 
06:35:27.470 --> 06:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
the only Three Harbors uh that impact
 
06:35:29.510 --> 06:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
Rye would be Rye Harbor Little Harbor
 
06:35:31.548 --> 06:35:31.558 align:start position:0%

and it would it would seem to me
 
06:39:17.750 --> 06:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
that issues that arise uh by these two
 
06:39:20.510 --> 06:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
towns would fall under due consideration
 
06:39:24.170 --> 06:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
by by your Authority
 
06:39:26.030 --> 06:39:26.040 align:start position:0%

meetings our public meetings all of our
 
06:39:32.570 --> 06:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
meetings whether it's dph division of
 
06:39:34.548 --> 06:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
ports and harbors a public you know
 
06:39:37.310 --> 06:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed uh welcome and minutes
 
06:39:39.110 --> 06:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
are reported
 
06:39:41.868 --> 06:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
um and posted online uh accordingly
 
06:39:44.330 --> 06:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you questions the committee yes
 
06:39:46.128 --> 06:39:46.138 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you Mr
 
06:39:47.690 --> 06:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you gentlemen for
 
06:39:50.810 --> 06:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
appearing uh if I understand the there
 
06:39:53.510 --> 06:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
is one House member on the on the
 
06:39:55.610 --> 06:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
commission as it is on the on the
 
06:39:56.930 --> 06:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
authority on the board
 
06:39:59.930 --> 06:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
and if you will that member would
 
06:40:03.430 --> 06:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
represent at large all of the towns that
 
06:40:06.530 --> 06:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh impinge on the PDA and this the
 
06:40:08.990 --> 06:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
effect of this the original bill would
 
06:40:11.090 --> 06:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
be to specialize that member to only
 
06:40:13.730 --> 06:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
represent Ryan Newcastle thereby
 
06:40:16.250 --> 06:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
depriving all of the other towns of that
 
06:40:19.368 --> 06:40:19.378 align:start position:0%
person's uh representation is that your
 
06:40:20.868 --> 06:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that's how I understand
 
06:40:24.048 --> 06:40:24.058 align:start position:0%
the bill and yes we we currently have a
 
06:40:27.830 --> 06:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:27.840 --> 06:40:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:40:36.590 --> 06:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:38.510 --> 06:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:40:41.448 --> 06:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
taking my question at your meetings do
 
06:40:43.490 --> 06:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
you allow public comment or republican
 
06:40:44.690 --> 06:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
for it
 
06:40:50.510 --> 06:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:54.650 --> 06:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:59.150 --> 06:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh gentlemen we don't have a copy of Mr
 
06:41:01.548 --> 06:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
Dupree's letter here in committee today
 
06:41:05.750 --> 06:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't know point of order yes
 
06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
um the letter was sent to us via email
 
06:41:11.150 --> 06:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
just so you know last night I did have
 
06:41:13.430 --> 06:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review chairman
 
06:41:16.548 --> 06:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
Duprees uh letter it was about three
 
06:41:18.830 --> 06:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
about two and a half pages in length the
 
06:41:20.990 --> 06:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
gist of it was expressing opposition to
 
06:41:23.090 --> 06:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
to the bill just so that it's added to
 
06:41:25.010 --> 06:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
the record thank you
 
06:41:26.330 --> 06:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:41:29.208 --> 06:41:29.218 align:start position:0%

06:41:31.430 --> 06:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
I can provide 20 copies thank you I
 
06:41:34.610 --> 06:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that and and is there
 
06:41:38.810 --> 06:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
possibly a map that shows where your
 
06:41:42.230 --> 06:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilities lie in also
 
06:41:45.530 --> 06:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
you're with the the towns that your
 
06:41:48.110 --> 06:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
Authority has oversight in Mr chairman
 
06:41:49.610 --> 06:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
yes and Mr Dupree's letter there's
 
06:41:51.288 --> 06:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
actually a map attached to them as an
 
06:41:53.930 --> 06:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
exhibit okay thank you
 
06:41:56.690 --> 06:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
and if if you can if you can indulge me
 
06:41:58.430 --> 06:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
in one question then I'll come back to
 
06:42:00.910 --> 06:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jack
 
06:42:04.690 --> 06:42:04.700 align:start position:0%
when when these Development Authority
 
06:42:07.628 --> 06:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
was first initiated
 
06:42:11.270 --> 06:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
was it to the benefit of only the towns
 
06:42:13.190 --> 06:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
that it was in because I'm of the
 
06:42:14.868 --> 06:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that is supposed to
 
06:42:17.390 --> 06:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
benefit the entire state
 
06:42:20.330 --> 06:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
could you answer that question
 
06:42:22.190 --> 06:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair
 
06:42:22.200 --> 06:42:22.850 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair
um

06:42:22.850 --> 06:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:25.730 --> 06:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
again my name is Bob Cheney
 
06:42:27.948 --> 06:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
when the peace Development Authority was
 
06:42:30.350 --> 06:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
created in uh
 
06:42:33.650 --> 06:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
legislation in 1990 I was then associate
 
06:42:35.628 --> 06:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
attorney general in the Attorney
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
General's office and I was detailed to
 
06:42:40.190 --> 06:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
work for the peace Development Authority
 
06:42:43.128 --> 06:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
when we established the statute and and
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
the thing to remember about the peace
 
06:42:48.288 --> 06:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
Development Authority and the way the
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
statute is set up that's very important
 
06:42:54.610 --> 06:42:54.620 align:start position:0%
is that this is a state facility it is
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
state-owned land it is the state that
 
06:43:00.110 --> 06:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
has an obligation when when the state
 
06:43:02.150 --> 06:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
took this property through the peas
 
06:43:04.548 --> 06:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
Development Authority from the federal
 
06:43:07.010 --> 06:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
government the state made a commitment
 
06:43:09.410 --> 06:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
to the federal government that we would
 
06:43:11.470 --> 06:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
operate that airport as a public airport
 
06:43:13.910 --> 06:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
essentially forever
 
06:43:16.250 --> 06:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
if we ever stop operating it as a public
 
06:43:18.948 --> 06:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
airport there's a reverter clause in the
 
06:43:22.070 --> 06:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
Deeds that came to the state in 2003 and
 
06:43:24.830 --> 06:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
2005 and it all reverts back to the
 
06:43:26.090 --> 06:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
06:43:30.230 --> 06:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
so this is a state agency the peas
 
06:43:32.390 --> 06:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
Development Authority it's it's
 
06:43:35.150 --> 06:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
obviously a little different and if you
 
06:43:36.650 --> 06:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
had time and the interest I could
 
06:43:40.430 --> 06:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
explain how that happened but it is a
 
06:43:42.770 --> 06:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
state agency somewhat different than
 
06:43:45.170 --> 06:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
your typical uh
 
06:43:48.288 --> 06:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
state agency but the thing to remember
 
06:43:50.208 --> 06:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
about the responsibility of these board
 
06:43:52.610 --> 06:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
members and if you look at the purpose
 
06:43:53.990 --> 06:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
and intent of the statute in the
 
06:43:55.788 --> 06:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
legislative history
 
06:43:57.890 --> 06:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
the Redevelopment appease was intended
 
06:44:00.530 --> 06:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
for State purposes to benefit all the
 
06:44:03.530 --> 06:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state it says
 
06:44:07.368 --> 06:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
and and so the representation the the
 
06:44:09.890 --> 06:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
obligation of the board members sitting
 
06:44:12.708 --> 06:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
on that board is to manage this trade
 
06:44:15.230 --> 06:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
port for the benefit of the Seacoast
 
06:44:16.730 --> 06:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
region but for the benefit of all the
 
06:44:20.270 --> 06:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
people in the state but they are acting
 
06:44:23.150 --> 06:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
as agents for the state agency you
 
06:44:26.330 --> 06:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
people get nominated to participate in
 
06:44:28.190 --> 06:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
this by whether it's the speaker the
 
06:44:30.650 --> 06:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
Senate President the governor Portsmouth
 
06:44:33.110 --> 06:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
Newington or the other municipalities
 
06:44:33.120 --> 06:44:34.970 align:start position:0%
Newington or the other municipalities
but

06:44:34.970 --> 06:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:44:38.030 --> 06:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
while the appointments may come out of
 
06:44:42.170 --> 06:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:44.270 --> 06:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not like being a
 
06:44:46.610 --> 06:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative you're a board member you
 
06:44:49.128 --> 06:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
have obligations to the board there are
 
06:44:51.368 --> 06:44:51.378 align:start position:0%
things that are confidential
 
06:44:54.350 --> 06:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibilities as a board
 
06:44:56.208 --> 06:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
member to that board
 
06:44:58.910 --> 06:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:45:01.190 --> 06:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
the proceedings are very public as the
 
06:45:03.110 --> 06:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
executive director has explained but
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
your job is to serve on that state
 
06:45:07.910 --> 06:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
agency on that state board
 
06:45:10.368 --> 06:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that
 
06:45:12.650 --> 06:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative and uh thank you again
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
if I remember the map in Mr Dupree's
 
06:45:18.708 --> 06:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
letter uh it only covered the airport
 
06:45:20.990 --> 06:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
and the property surrounding it and what
 
06:45:23.330 --> 06:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
town that was in and now that the
 
06:45:25.310 --> 06:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
division of ports and harbors is part of
 
06:45:27.530 --> 06:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
the PDA I think there are other
 
06:45:30.350 --> 06:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
properties on the water that I think are
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
the subject of this and that's what we
 
06:45:34.930 --> 06:45:34.940 align:start position:0%
don't have a map of well to be clear
 
06:45:37.368 --> 06:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
division Imports and harbors operates
 
06:45:39.470 --> 06:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
under its own State Statute we have
 
06:45:41.270 --> 06:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
General administrative oversight a
 
06:45:43.070 --> 06:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
division of ports and harbors but yes
 
06:45:45.470 --> 06:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
you were correct the division of ports
 
06:45:47.030 --> 06:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
and harbors would would Encompass
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Hampton Rye in the coastal
 
06:45:50.760 --> 06:45:52.190 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Hampton Rye in the coastal
waterways

06:45:52.190 --> 06:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
waterways
 
06:45:54.530 --> 06:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
of the authority does that
 
06:45:59.390 --> 06:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me but the authority does not
 
06:46:01.850 --> 06:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
you you have over you have oversight of
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the port
 
06:46:06.110 --> 06:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
the pier
 
06:46:08.208 --> 06:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
but we have we have administrative
 
06:46:08.218 --> 06:46:09.788 align:start position:0%
but we have we have administrative
oversight

06:46:09.788 --> 06:46:09.798 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
06:46:12.110 --> 06:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
division in ports and harbors operates
 
06:46:15.010 --> 06:46:15.020 align:start position:0%
under a separate statute
 
06:46:18.288 --> 06:46:18.298 align:start position:0%
okay let me just explain please
 
06:46:18.298 --> 06:46:19.310 align:start position:0%
okay let me just explain please
um

06:46:19.310 --> 06:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:22.368 --> 06:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
when the division it was the New
 
06:46:24.830 --> 06:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Port Authority and and it was
 
06:46:24.840 --> 06:46:26.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Port Authority and and it was
determined

06:46:26.270 --> 06:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
determined
 
06:46:28.128 --> 06:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
06:46:32.270 --> 06:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
it was in 2001 that we should merge the
 
06:46:34.070 --> 06:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Port Authority into the
 
06:46:35.868 --> 06:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
peas Development Authority
 
06:46:37.850 --> 06:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
So within the peas Development Authority
 
06:46:39.948 --> 06:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
there is a division of ports and harvest
 
06:46:44.750 --> 06:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is subject to Direction by by the
 
06:46:48.170 --> 06:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
PDA board what is separate between the
 
06:46:50.930 --> 06:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
two is that because of the requirements
 
06:46:53.868 --> 06:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
for operating the public Airport
 
06:46:56.390 --> 06:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
all of the funds generated off the trade
 
06:46:59.390 --> 06:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
Port go into support of the airport
 
06:47:01.610 --> 06:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
all the funds related to the division of
 
06:47:03.590 --> 06:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
ports and harbors stay at the division
 
06:47:06.048 --> 06:47:06.058 align:start position:0%
of ports and harbors so it's all under
 
06:47:09.850 --> 06:47:09.860 align:start position:0%
one PDA organization but there are very
 
06:47:12.850 --> 06:47:12.860 align:start position:0%
separate responsibilities and separate
 
06:47:15.410 --> 06:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
accounting for the finances but it is
 
06:47:17.150 --> 06:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
part of the Visa Development Authority
 
06:47:21.530 --> 06:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:24.890 --> 06:47:24.900 align:start position:0%

62. thank you motion to itl is there a
second

07:22:08.390 --> 07:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:22:08.400 --> 07:22:10.030 align:start position:0%
second
second

07:22:10.030 --> 07:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:22:14.390 --> 07:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
by Jackson Jack thank you
 
07:22:17.030 --> 07:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
07:22:22.010 --> 07:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman please I have been in uh in
 
07:22:24.468 --> 07:22:24.478 align:start position:0%
2014 having been involved in the effort
 
07:22:27.110 --> 07:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
along with former chairman Campbell
 
07:22:29.270 --> 07:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
former Senator Roush and former
 
07:22:32.150 --> 07:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bouchard to raise the gas
 
07:22:35.330 --> 07:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
tax very modest increase by four cents
 
07:22:37.190 --> 07:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
if it had my way I would have done
 
07:22:39.650 --> 07:22:39.660 align:start position:0%
increased it higher but we got that
 
07:22:41.990 --> 07:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
through and that has benefit our our
 
07:22:43.448 --> 07:22:43.458 align:start position:0%
state eventually
 
07:22:47.090 --> 07:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
immensely and if we pass this bill it's
 
07:22:48.708 --> 07:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of unintended
 
07:22:51.890 --> 07:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
consequences for the bondholders and and
 
07:22:56.270 --> 07:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
for our state and until we finish this I
 
07:22:59.510 --> 07:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't even think of entertaining
 
07:23:02.570 --> 07:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
this lowering or eliminating the Gap
 
07:23:04.490 --> 07:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
until we get done our commission report
 
07:23:07.368 --> 07:23:07.378 align:start position:0%
and we Implement an alternative way to
 
07:23:08.868 --> 07:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
fund our roads and bridges but I think
 
07:23:11.270 --> 07:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to take several years and
 
07:23:14.150 --> 07:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be irresponsible to
 
07:23:16.968 --> 07:23:16.978 align:start position:0%
pass House Bill 62 and are we willing to
 
07:23:19.310 --> 07:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
to I'll get up on the house floor and
 
07:23:22.190 --> 07:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
say why and take the consequences good
 
07:23:24.230 --> 07:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
or bad thank you
 
07:23:27.230 --> 07:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um and I and I look forward to
 
07:23:28.750 --> 07:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
seeing you up there
 
07:23:30.890 --> 07:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you if I
 
07:23:32.690 --> 07:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
could just add two things uh having to
 
07:23:36.530 --> 07:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
mess with the Tiffy alone is a bad idea
 
07:23:38.690 --> 07:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
which we'd have to do if we pass this
 
07:23:41.990 --> 07:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is having to depend
 
07:23:44.390 --> 07:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
on General funds being available every
 
07:23:46.968 --> 07:23:46.978 align:start position:0%
single year for a number of bienniums is
 
07:23:49.610 --> 07:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
a bad idea and unlike what was said is
 
07:23:52.310 --> 07:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
not Revenue neutral it deprives the
 
07:23:54.650 --> 07:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
general fund of those funds and it
 
07:23:57.890 --> 07:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't replace them with other Revenue
 
07:24:00.890 --> 07:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comment
 
07:24:03.010 --> 07:24:03.020 align:start position:0%
yes please representative
 
07:24:04.968 --> 07:24:04.978 align:start position:0%
they said I know we heard a lot about
 
07:24:06.830 --> 07:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
who's subsidizing who but this bill
 
07:24:10.190 --> 07:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
would basically take a user fee
 
07:24:12.410 --> 07:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount that's paid by the
 
07:24:13.788 --> 07:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
users which isn't even enough to cover
 
07:24:17.030 --> 07:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
the system and make other taxpayers in
 
07:24:19.730 --> 07:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
the state pay that cost I just think
 
07:24:21.170 --> 07:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
the fairness of that ought to be enough
 
07:24:23.868 --> 07:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
to to kill it
 
07:24:28.190 --> 07:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:29.810 --> 07:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
I just say if you want to make it
 
07:24:30.890 --> 07:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
exciting instead
 
07:24:34.010 --> 07:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
John's motion we should amend it to
 
07:24:36.110 --> 07:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
extend for 20 years to cover the
 
07:24:38.830 --> 07:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
Concrete Expansion
 
07:24:40.968 --> 07:24:40.978 align:start position:0%
you're going to have fun let's have fun
 
07:24:44.150 --> 07:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay I um I am well it sounds like fun
 
07:24:46.390 --> 07:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
for a different day yeah
 
07:24:49.190 --> 07:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
the uh I will say that I was here in the
 
07:24:52.490 --> 07:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
house when we did pass that and there
 
07:24:55.390 --> 07:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
were a lot of slings and arrows for
 
07:24:57.770 --> 07:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
republicans and anyone else that stood
 
07:25:00.410 --> 07:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
on that committee to even raise that bar
 
07:25:03.250 --> 07:25:03.260 align:start position:0%
and I would agree I would agree with you
 
07:25:06.170 --> 07:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'd agree with John we were on actually
 
07:25:09.070 --> 07:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
unwanted posters on some sites so yeah
 
07:25:11.510 --> 07:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
so with that I think we've talked that
 
07:25:13.968 --> 07:25:13.978 align:start position:0%
out and we want to go home so Clark
 
07:25:15.708 --> 07:25:15.718 align:start position:0%

no it's not a
 
07:26:24.288 --> 07:26:24.298 align:start position:0%
is it because when there's a financial
 
07:26:26.570 --> 07:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
