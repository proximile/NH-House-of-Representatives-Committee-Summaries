00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of the vote outcome today you
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
have succeeded
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
you have succeeded because you have
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
brought this issue to this house floor
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
for debate thereby raising awareness for
 
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
for debate thereby raising awareness for
it

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
on that I would say congratulations and
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
job well done
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
now I must speak for the minority of the
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
committee for some concerns we had about
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
some of the specifics in the bill
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
first when it comes to the adding of a
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
new number to an ID card it's important
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
to note that we currently have a mandate
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
that there is a universal mental health
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
and crisis line on each ID card
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
this line is staffed 24 7.
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
by operators that are well trained to
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
triage incoming calls
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
provide the appropriate follow-ups
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
and if necessary get emergency services
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
to the individual making the call
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
in questioning we heard
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
that there is uncertainty as to the
 
00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:26.899 align:start position:0%
Staffing hours of this specific
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
hotline for eating disorders
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
we're unsure of the training
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
for the Personnel on the other end of
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
the line
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
we are unsure of the triage capabilities
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
and we are unsure of their their ability
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
to provide emergency services for crises
 
00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
I would
 
00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:50.150 align:start position:0%
I would
compare

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
compare
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation
 
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
to our current 911 system
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
we have a system we're in in New
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you dial 9-1-1 you reach an
 
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.490 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you dial 9-1-1 you reach an
operator

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
operator
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
who is trained to triage the incoming
 
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.069 align:start position:0%
who is trained to triage the incoming
call

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
and provide whatever emergency services
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
are necessary to your location
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
before we had this system each Town had
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
separate phone numbers for police for
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
fire and for EMS
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
and there is a legitimate concern that
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
adding additional con condition specific
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
numbers to an ID card would be a step
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
toward the old method of doing things
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
instead of the universal line that is
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
and it is for those reasons that I would
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
recommend against the OTP motion
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless provide thanks to the
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors and the young man involved
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:02.029 align:start position:0%
 
speaker

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
last fall a constituent of mine from
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Matthew Brown who is in the
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
gallery with his parents this morning
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
he's a 14 year old freshman at Merrimack
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
high school and he asked me to file a
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
bill to add the Eating Disorders
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
helpline to student IDs
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
he was very concerned about the
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
prevailence of Eating Disorders among
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
his peers and other young people
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
when I asked Matthew to describe this
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
problem to me his answer was astonishing
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
almost 30 million Americans suffer from
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
an eating disorder many being people
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 12 and 25.
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
students and adolescents with eating
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
disorders are among the most likely to
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
experience suicidal ideation and medical
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
complications and those with severe
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
symptoms are 11 times more likely to
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
attempt suicide
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
these young people don't see that as a
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
mental health issue they don't see it as
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
to a point where they would call a
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
suicide hotline they only see and
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
recognize that they have an eating
 
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.909 align:start position:0%
recognize that they have an eating
disorder

00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
by promoting the Eating Disorders
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
helpline on their school IDs students
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
will have communion access to connect
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
to the early treatment they need to find
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
helpline available is an is important to
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
friends and family
 
00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:39.299 align:start position:0%
who were often the ones to seek the help
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
for their loved one
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
the national Eating Disorders
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
Association provides counsel and
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
guidance for friends and family on how
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
to effectively intercede
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
many of us know the helplessness in
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
watching someone we care for continue
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
down a self-destructive path a path that
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
early intervention before it ever gets
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
to Suicide ideation
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
how that path to early intervention and
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
treatment can turn things around
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
disorders are complex they're dangerous
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
and they're common
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
this bull provides students access to
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
help that is specifically responsive to
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
the uniqueness of this issue
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
the 988 hotline is certainly valuable
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
but the Eating Disorders helpline
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
addresses a different need
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
in closing I want to thank Matthew Brown
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
for his initiative and energy in getting
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
education committee was so compelling
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
and impressive that the title of HB 81
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
know that the objective here to raise
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
awareness for the very real issue of
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
Eating Disorders has been achieved
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
through floor debate and if I know that
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
currently there is a universal mental
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
health line on all student ID cards that
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
serves this function should I now press
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
the red button
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
do I recognize representative Ladd for
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill places the Eating
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
student identification cards
 
00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
and if I further know Eating Disorders
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
among students in grades 6 through 12
 
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
have become a tragic and devastating
 
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.549 align:start position:0%
have become a tragic and devastating

reality
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that by placing this
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
help number on student IDs it will help
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
save lives families and future

Constitutional Amendment that will

for judges in New Hampshire from age 70
 
00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
to age 75.
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan proposal
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
and I am honored that the person who
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this bill with me is the
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
ranking member of the other party in the
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%

from Manchester
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
this bill also received overwhelming
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support from our Judiciary
 
00:32:56.279 --> 00:32:57.649 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support from our Judiciary
Committee

00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
the 70-year age limit for judges has
 
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
been a part of the New Hampshire
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution since it was first adopted
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
in 1784.
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
at that time the average life expectancy
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
in this country was 38.
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
so at that time not many prospective
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
judges were likely to be affected by the
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
age limit
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
things are much different today average
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
life expectancy is now
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
76.4 years with women having
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
approximately six year greater longevity
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
than men
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
so now the age limitation does have real
 
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
consequences for our state in terms of
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
the loss of service of Highly qualified
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
and experienced judicial officers
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
let me stress here that this is a very
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
Modest Proposal
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
as you know under the federal system
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
there is no age limit for judges
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
I believe that that is a mistake because
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
not only with respect to judges but with
 
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.529 align:start position:0%
not only with respect to judges but with
respect

00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:03.539 align:start position:0%
to all occupations there does come a
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
point at which the likelihood of
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
diminished mental capacity resulting
 
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
from age makes it prudent to preclude
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
further service but I respectfully
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
submit that in today's world age 70 is
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
simply too young to impose such a
 
00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.109 align:start position:0%
simply too young to impose such a
restriction

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
as proof of this point I asked how many
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
people in this room are over 70 and
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
believe that you are no longer competent
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
let let me give you three brief examples
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
of what I mean

uncanny ability to read people and

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
could want in a judge
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%

English teacher
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
and the rest of us on the court would
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
Marvel at her ability to catch and fix
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
our there to for unnoticed grammatical
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
faux pas before our opinions were
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
cleared for release
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
if the proposed Constitutional Amendment
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
had been in effect the citizens of New
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would have had the benefit of
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
the service of each of these judges for
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
five additional years
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment will not be retroactive
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
and therefore comes too late for them
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
and for any other judges including
 
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.569 align:start position:0%
and for any other judges including
myself

00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
myself

who are already 70 or who will turn 70
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
before the amendment if approved by the
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
legislature can be voted on by by the
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
citizens in November of 2020 of 2024 and
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
I should note just so that it's clear I
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
will be 75 by November of 2024 too so it
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
has absolutely no effect on me
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
but what I suggest to you is please
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
let's not let the benefit of uh of the
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
five years of additional service be lost
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
to any more experienced judges in the
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
this will
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
allow for less than Aquarium to

meeting remotely is not equitable

and is not a hundred percent attainable

remote participation by state board
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
committee members again is not equitable
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
as not every member or the public has
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
internet access for example I know in my
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
town citizens on North Road just
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
obtained adequate internet and it took
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
two years to obtain
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
we have many areas of New Hampshire that
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
still don't have excessive accessible to
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
really great internet
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
equal access to a public meeting has to
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
be a hundred percent to both the State
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
Board committee members and members of
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
the public anything less is unacceptable
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
there should be a standard of functional

there should be a standard of functional

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
what is considered functional equipment

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
when a person accepts an appointment is
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
this better
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
okay our nomination to a board that
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
person knows that in-person attendance
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
is expected
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
until the day arrives that every citizen

not be allowed as a way to conduct

thank you Mr Speaker

House Bill 308 seeks to enable but not
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
to mandate that state boards committees
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
councils and like State bodies may vote
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
to allow remote participation when being
 
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
physically present isn't reasonably
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
practical for a member
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to the general court
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
nor any Committee of either house nor
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
the governor nor the executive Council
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
it requires that one-third of the total
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
membership be physically present in the
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
in person at the meeting location
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
passing this will better enable people
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
from all four corners of our state to
 
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
participate on boards
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
so that we may get the best in most
 
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
qualified people on our boards not just
 
00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
the ones who happen to live closest
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
this will enable remote attendance when
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
needed in cases such as members with
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
disabilities who have struggled to make
 
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
Quorum as is the case with a special ed
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
advisory committee which is required to
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
be maintained under federal law and to
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
have a majority of members with
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
disabilities or be parents of children
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
with disabilities
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
this will also allow Physicians who may
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
be on call and need to be near their
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital in the case of an emergency to
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
participate on the rare disease advisory

I ask you to vote otpa on this bill for
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
the benefit of allowing boards to make
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
their own decision on this important
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
issue as my fellow rep from Windham
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
likes to say rep McMahon let's get this

Mr Speaker if I know that this bill with

the amendment we have just approved

and by members of the public attending
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
the meeting at the meeting site and if I
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
know that this bill applies only to
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
meetings of state boards commissions Etc
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
but not to meetings of local or County
 
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:54.540 align:start position:0%

committee nor to meetings of the

governor and Council and if I also know
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
that we have received evidence from
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
various state boards and commissions
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
indicating that their ability to operate
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
effectively and to carry out their
 
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
assigned responsibilities is being
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
significantly adversely affected by the
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
requirement of physical presence of all
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%

as you can tell I'm very new at this I'm
 
00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
hoping not to screw it up the member
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
will suspended
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
all right and then when they continue
 
01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
I can't hear it so the member may
 
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:11.690 align:start position:0%
I can't hear it so the member may
continue

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
I have been told my my uh most esteemed
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
colleague to keep it brief and so I will
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
one of the things that bothers me about
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
this bill is that oh and by the way I'm
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
Carrie Speer I recommend I represent
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
Nashua Ward 3.
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm against this bill and the reason
 
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
why is that it singles out very specific
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
towns and the towns include towns like
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua Rochester Portsmouth
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
Dover and a few others because simply
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
because they have sewers
 
01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
my background is engineering so what I
 
01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
did was I investigated this condition of
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
the sewers of at least the major towns
 
01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299 align:start position:0%
that's Nashville and Manchester
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
both those sewer systems are absolutely
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
stressed to capacity so to assume that
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
we can automatically just
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
quadruple the number of houses on some
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
very small Lots
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
without any investigation is not valid
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
I can I wrote down three pages of
 
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
Investigation I'm not going to read it
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
but that is a fact
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
the other problem we have is that Nashua
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
and Manchester their public water
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
systems are also stressed to capacity
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
water pressure is down at the level
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
where if you take a shower and someone
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
else flushes a toilet in the house
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose your water pressure
 
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
we that's all we have that's about 28 to
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
30 pounds
 
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
most uh equipment like washing machines
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
dish dryers and those sort of things
 
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
require or recommend 60 pounds of
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
pressure to keep the valves working
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
properly so we have water pressure
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
issues we have parking issues Nashua
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
only says one and a half Cars per
 
01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.210 align:start position:0%
only says one and a half Cars per
apartment

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
that means one of you is taking a
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
tricycle to work
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
we have laws on the books that say
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities and I can quote the law
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to but that
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the right to set up
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
their zoning the way they see fit for
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
the communities and the densities and
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
the populations that they have we spoke
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday about
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
about that kind of an issue uh a number
 
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
of times that is to say that we didn't
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
want to step on municipalities when we
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't know the details of what those
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities are going through and
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this bill does
 
01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
I have been assured by my esteemed
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
colleague who I Revere that there are
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
towns that don't have zoning laws
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's a way to attack this
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
but Nashua Manchester and a number of
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
the other towns that I mentioned are so
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
overpopulated diversity has been
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned Nashua and Manchester are the
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
most diverse towns that we have in this
 
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.789 align:start position:0%
most diverse towns that we have in this
state

01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh I think on that point I'm going to
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
let it go I've said my points and I just
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
want you to be assured that it's not
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
that we don't want housing we need
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
housing Nashua is building 160 a 240
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
unit building that's replacing a 48
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
building housing effort that they had
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
already they took it down and built
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
another one they've got others on the
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
plans but in those plans they also plan
 
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
for expanding and trying to improve the
 
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
sewer system
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
monies had to be allocated we're talking
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
about millions of dollars in order to
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
upgrade those systems just to
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
accommodate the buildings that they have
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
planned all of a sudden trying to throw
 
01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
in a bunch of uh
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
independently decided quadruple quad
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
plexus into various small wedging little
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
areas doesn't help the sewers and
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't help any kind of planning
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
I've saved my whole life to be able to
 
01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
buy my house to have my house free and
 
01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
clear of a mortgage by the time I retire
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
next door there's a rental
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
I don't want what I've saved my whole
 
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.890 align:start position:0%
I don't want what I've saved my whole
life

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the the value of that house to go
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
down such that I can't take the equity
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
out when I need it I know that's selfish
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
but that's what we're doing to the
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
entire area by allowing these these
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
little properties to be split up
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
I would like to end on this one note
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
when New York City Gramercy Park
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
planners designed the rebuild of the
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
World Trade Center
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
after careful research they decided that
 
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
a top priority for the well for the
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
well-being of the neighborhood was to
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
include more Open Spaces not less
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
and that's in an area where each square
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
foot of land is worth more than I
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
probably earned in my lifetime
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
so just think of that when we when we
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
take away and Destroy every piece of
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
green area that we have
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
and think carefully about that thank you

I represent Laconia
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
okay in this deal I've also had 25 years
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
in working with zoning boards in two
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
different states 20 years in New
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in five years and the State of
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
Florida okay
 
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.630 align:start position:0%
Florida okay
um

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
with working with zoning
 
01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
you know I've looked at this bill and
 
01:06:10.089 --> 01:06:10.099 align:start position:0%
this bill will force many of the
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities to permit as a matter of
 
01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.890 align:start position:0%
municipalities to permit as a matter of
right

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
a matter of right
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's a key word
 
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.010 align:start position:0%
that's a key word
okay

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
to build four units on any single family
 
01:06:28.619 --> 01:06:30.289 align:start position:0%
to build four units on any single family
lot

01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:30.299 align:start position:0%
lot
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay now if you look at this it's also
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
caveat with the ability for them to have
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
sewer and water so now we're narrowing
 
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:44.900 align:start position:0%
the scope to cities and towns that have
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
uh sewer and water okay so most of these
 
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:51.299 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have already been
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
mostly built out so we're not looking at
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
a lot of land that has single family
 
01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.930 align:start position:0%
a lot of land that has single family
residential

01:06:58.930 --> 01:06:58.940 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
designations on them what you're looking
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
at is already developed
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
areas of residential areas
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
that have been built
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
now the other part of this Bill is
 
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
saying that we're doing it to improve
 
01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:18.410 align:start position:0%
saying that we're doing it to improve
housing

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.630 align:start position:0%
housing
well

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
in one sense it would increase housing
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
but on the other sense if you took an
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
established neighborhood that had a
 
01:07:32.289 --> 01:07:32.299 align:start position:0%
couple of houses that need to be
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
refurbished or upgraded or whatnot these
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
are the types of homes that your
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
that's what they can afford and then
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
they invest their life into these homes
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
to upgrade in them and bringing them up
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
to Neighborhood standards and then
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully one day being able to sell it
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
for a profit
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
which is the American dream okay a own
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
in your home and B being able to sell it
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
for a profit
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
so now let's imagine these same homes in
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
your neighborhood
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
that now an investor
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
someone who don't even care to live
 
01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
someone who don't even care to live
there

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
has no investment in the neighborhood no
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
investment in the character of the
 
01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.450 align:start position:0%
investment in the character of the
neighborhood

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
are the value they don't care they're
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
looking at how can I profit mostly from
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
so knowingly they come in they buy this
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
property they tear the house down
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
and then build a quad Plex four units
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they wish
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
if you look at also this bill what it
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
does because remember that word right
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
it takes it out of anybody's review
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
so all those people who live in these
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods who have invested their
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
life in these neighborhoods have now had
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
their opinion of how the character of
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood should look
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
that have no recourse to talk to any
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
government they have no recourse to talk
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
to their city council that have no
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
recourse to talk to their locally either
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed zoning board
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
they have nothing
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
except to have to accept the will
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
of Big Brother telling them how they're
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
now going to live
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
is this what we do in New Hampshire I
 
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
don't think so
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think one of the greatest things as I
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
stand here before this great
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
legislative body is the fact that do we
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
always agree no but we have great
 
01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.890 align:start position:0%
always agree no but we have great
debates

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
debates
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I get chill bumps every time we have
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
these great debates okay and so when you
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
come down to the city level which this
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
isn't also infringent on this City's
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
level to determine how their communities
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay it's taking that right away so you
 
01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:29.420 align:start position:0%
have a state level trying to dictate
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
what the cities should be required to do
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
and if it was such a great Bill why do
 
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
you take all the people's opportunity to
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
voice opposition away because you
 
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:50.530 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:52.729 align:start position:0%

01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
how would you feel if the federal
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
government come down and said well we
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
want to Trump yours and we want to tell
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
you how you're going to live
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would not put up with that
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
nor should New Hampshire have to put up
 
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
therefore I ask that you vote no
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
on ought to pass
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you as a member of yield the
 
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.970 align:start position:0%
thank you as a member of yield the
questions

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
no member does not yield
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
House Bill 44 re-legalizes as in makes
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
them legal again building types that we
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
love in historic neighborhoods
 
01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
fully using infrastructure already in
 
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
place what this bill does it is it
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
allows up to four units to be carved out
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
basement or attic Apartments returning
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
an old Victorian home to multiple condo
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
units allowing for more housing only in
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
properties serviced by Municipal Water
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
and Sewer only
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
in family single-family residential
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
zones this is infill housing
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is not an affordable housing bill
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is a more housing Bill we heard a
 
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:24.620 align:start position:0%
report from the New Hampshire
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
housing.org that it would take at least
 
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.850 align:start position:0%
housing.org that it would take at least
20

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
000 units to achieve a balanced housing
 
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
market in New Hampshire right now there
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
are less than 1 000 units available for
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
sale on the multiple listing service you
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
can't fix what you don't face to fix our
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
housing shortage we must face it head on
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
we've been here before this legislature
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
passed a bill to allow accessory
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
dwelling units and gave municipalities a
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
year to decide how to implement
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units locally
 
01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
this bill is absolutely also subject to
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
local control just like accessory
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
dwelling units were
 
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
you've heard that municipalities can
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
solve the issue of needing 20 000 units
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
on their own respectfully can solve a
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
problem and will solve a problem are two
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
very different things we are in this
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
situation because for decades
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities have moved to
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
exclusionary zoning creating
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
single-family requirements where we once
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
allowed Property Owners to house
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
multiple families Under One Roof
 
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
according to the mercatus institute at
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
George Mason University states are
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
within their rights to preempt local
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
governments when the key levers to
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
achieving a major State goal twenty
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
thousand housing units are held
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at the local level
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
the state building code is a good
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
example setting a baseline for health
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
and safety even though the structural
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
soundness of a building is a local issue
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
in contrast solving a Statewide lack of
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
housing addresses a broad problem and
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
should be solved by us the elected
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
legislators for the entire State nobody
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
else is going to step in and correct the
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
balance this is problem for us to solve
 
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
we are the ones that we have been
 
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
waiting for this legislature has the
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
power to address our current housing
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
crisis and pass this good housing Bill
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
your own municipalities will determine
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
how they want to implement parking

01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Housing Finance Authority to

give towns money to update these zoning
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%

people who choose to add a unit to their
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%

Hampshire economy
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
it is our duty as legislators to fix
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
this and pass this good housing Bill
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker good afternoon
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues I re rise to speak in
 
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
opposition to the motion of OTP this
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation would mandate arguments
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to allow as a matter of
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
right for dwelling units on a
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
residential lot with access to Municipal
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer I want to make two
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
points based on discussions uh within
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
our Committee hearing the first one was
 
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
a young man who came and testified
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
that he owned a property in the North
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
he said his Free Will should allow him
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
to do whatever he wants to do on that
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
piece of property
 
01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
so I asked the young man I said how long
 
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
ago did you buy your property and he
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
said two years and I said when you
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
bought that property did you buy that
 
01:16:14.209 --> 01:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
property based on your own free will
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
and he said yes
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I left the questioning there because
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
my point was you bought that property on
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
your own free will you should also know
 
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
the regulations that you bought that
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
property under
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm familiar familiar with the North
 
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
End of Manchester at least a couple
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods because my mom and my
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
grandmother grew up there in a
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of almost 70 that's about
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
70 years old
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
the second question I asked was why Lots
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
Without Water and Sewer were exempt from
 
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
and I brought up the point in my town we
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
have an 80 000 foot square 80 000 square
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
foot lot minimum
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
why if the well resources were good
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
and why if we were able to have adequate
 
01:17:04.739 --> 01:17:06.110 align:start position:0%
and why if we were able to have adequate
leaching

01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
leaching
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
why was that not acceptable
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
and the answer I received was to
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
maintain the rural characteristics
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
so here we have a classic example of
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
nimbyism not in my backyard for those
 
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
who are unfamiliar with the the term and
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
I would take it one step further than
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
that I'd call it a little bit on the
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
hypocritical side
 
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
are not the owners of these residential
 
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
neighbors neighborhoods also entitled to
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
their neighborhood characteristics
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
without their neighborhoods being forced
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
into these mandates
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
now speaking of unfunded mandates many
 
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
on our committee and several who
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
testified and you've heard a little bit
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
about it today we're talking about the
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
demands on the municipal water and sewer
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
system that they would increase
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
significantly and of course that's true
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
who's going to be required to foot the
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
cost of this is going to be the towns
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
there's going to be the taxpayers it's
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
going to be the cities who's going to
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
pay for that
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
and more importantly when those costs
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
come up
 
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
are the supporters of this bill today
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to be coming back to this body
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
and asking for all the state's taxpayers
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
to pay for the upgrades in their towns
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
also I'd like to talk about I think how
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
this this bill picks winners and lures
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh losers you'd have the builders land
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
landlords landlords investors and the
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
obvious winners but most homeowners are
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
going to end up being losers as their
 
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods are altered taxpayers are
 
01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
going to definitely be the the biggest
 
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
losers because the small increase in
 
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
property taxes collected on those
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
properties are going to be dwarfed by
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
the huge increases in Education costs
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
and social service costs
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's been mentioned towns and cities
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
already can accomplish what this bill
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
tries to accomplish it's called zoning
 
01:19:02.699 --> 01:19:05.149 align:start position:0%
tries to accomplish it's called zoning
regulations

01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
and those regulations are the purview of
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
the municipalities they know their
 
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:10.510 align:start position:0%
the municipalities they know their
infrastructure

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and citizens preferences
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
best we do not need Central planning
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
inspired legislation being forced upon
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
and mandated to these local communities
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
without regard to the fiscal and social
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
impact I'd ask that you join me in
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button so another
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.729 --> 01:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
I race in support of the majority
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to pass we have
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
been building we have been under
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
building homes in New Hampshire for
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
years and the short supply has driven
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
prices up at an accelerating rate
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
we need over 20 000 more homes in New
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be at an equilibrium
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
do those twenty thousand homes on the
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
outskirts of towns requiring New Roads
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure make the most sense
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
or does fully utilizing the existing
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure make more sense
 
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to allow individuals who
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
want more homes in existing capacity on
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure to be able to do
 
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.149 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure to be able to do
so

01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
right now if a property owner wants to
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
propose a project which meets setbacks
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
height parking and other requirements of
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
the town but increases the units on the
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
lot to for the petty tyrants shove their
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
boot in the neck of the homeowners and
 
01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:42.500 align:start position:0%
tell them no
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary no's are the what got us in
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
this place and are that are what the
 
01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
state of housing
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
um in the state of housing in New
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I asked you to join me in
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the individual property
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
rights of those citizens by removing the
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
petty tyrants
 
01:20:59.450 --> 01:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
power to say no for no other reason that
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
they that they centrally planned that
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
the property be some other use than the
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
property owner wishes I ask you to join
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
me in protecting the rural communities
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
by encouraging the return to historic
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods to their intended use
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
instead of increasing pressure on
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
building on the outskirts of your town
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%

01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:19.500 align:start position:0%

Jay I recognize representative turcott
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:56.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know the
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities already can implement the
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations suggested by this
 
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:03.860 align:start position:0%
bill without the heavy hand of
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic or political influence and
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
if I also know that forcing Central
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
planning inspired regulations will
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
create fiscal and social inequities
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
mandating four units on residential lots
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
will end up creating unfunded mandates
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
on municipalities forced to upgrade
 
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
their water and sewer systems would I
 
01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
now press the red button so another
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Keller for a
 
01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:24:38.209 --> 01:24:38.219 align:start position:0%
infill in places served by water and
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
sewer spreads the cost for each mile of
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure over more people
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
people lowering the cost of the system
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
and taxes for each of those served and
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
letting the rest of New Hampshire be
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
more rural than they would otherwise be
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
as an alternative to building more
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
houses further and further into the
 
01:24:55.729 --> 01:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
rural communities and if I know that the
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
state has the power to rein in decades
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
of rampant overzoning at the municipal
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
level and restore property rights to
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
provide desperately needed housing at
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the property owner and
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
if I know that the state should not
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
allow the representation of things the
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
state has allowed municipalities to
 
01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.219 align:start position:0%
regulate to be captured by home owner
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
cronyism against the individual property
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
rights eroding those rights we are here
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
to protect would I now press the green
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%

would like to make a motion to the table
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%

01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%

state of New Hampshire is so bad
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
that the house set up a special
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with the problem
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
if I know that that committee would like
 
01:28:24.410 --> 01:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
to have all available options
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%

this problem
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%

01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
are true
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to speak
 
01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:23.900 align:start position:0%
against house bill
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
123. the bill seeks to change the role
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
of the governing body representative and
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
the school board representative on local
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
budget committees
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
the issue that came forward to the
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
during the public hearings was that
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
during the formation of the warrant
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
articles the governing body and the
 
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
school board representative would never
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
vote to make any changes and that they
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
would work against the committee to try
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
to undermine the majority
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
current law actually deals with this
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
issue governing Bodies In addition to
 
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
having a school board excuse me budget
 
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
committees in addition to having a
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
governing body in the school board
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative have three to twelve
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
at-large members that are elected that
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
provide a majority of the budgeting
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
committee and provide oversight to
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
prevent exactly that problem
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to go further by
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
stripping the school board and governing
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
body representative of their voting
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
rights it it drives a wedge between the
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
governing body the school board and the
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget committee and hinders the ability
 
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
of the many well-functioning budget
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
committees in sb2 communities across the
 
01:34:42.649 --> 01:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
state that are able to craft well
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
thought through budgets that are passed
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
by their communities
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to solve a problem by
 
01:34:54.010 --> 01:34:54.020 align:start position:0%
creating many many more and should be
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
voted against inexpediate to legislate
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh honorable
 
01:35:08.689 --> 01:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
colleagues so
 
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
this is a great bill and it's a needed
 
01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:12.590 align:start position:0%
this is a great bill and it's a needed
bill

01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
we just heard that authoritative budget
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
committees are composed of three to 11
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
at large members
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
and an appointed member that's appointed
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
from the select board
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
and appointed member from the school
 
01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:29.330 align:start position:0%
and appointed member from the school
board

01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is the school
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
board and the select board members have
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
already had
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
their bite at the Apple
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
and they've already had their vote
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
one person one vote
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
that is a pillar of American democracy
 
01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
we accidentally got a little sidetracked
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
when it comes to authoritative budget
 
01:35:54.719 --> 01:35:56.090 align:start position:0%
when it comes to authoritative budget
committees

01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
so the select board member or the school
 
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
board member being appointed to
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
represent the will of the school board
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
or the select board
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
have to vote in accordance with what
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
those boards have already voted
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
a select board member can't show up at a
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
budget committee meeting
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
and vote contrary to what the board that
 
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
they came off of already voted because
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
they're there to represent the will of
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
that board
 
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
so if I have an elected at large budget
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
Committee of three people
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
and I have two that are appointed
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
it all but guarantees I have to have all
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
three votes to be able to carry it sets
 
01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659 align:start position:0%
the bar much much higher because the
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
appointed members
 
01:36:50.209 --> 01:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
aren't free to act
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
but wait
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
it gets worse
 
01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.270 align:start position:0%
it gets worse
so

01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
pretend I'm the appointed School Board
 
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.570 align:start position:0%
pretend I'm the appointed School Board
member

01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
how is it
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
that I vote
 
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
on Municipal questions
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a member of the select
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
board so I have no guidance I'm
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
appointed by the school board the school
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
board does not discuss does not take
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
positions on the municipal budget
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
and so they're voting
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
without representing their board because
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
they can't know the will of the board
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
vice versa for the select board member
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
so what happens in all practicality what
 
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
actually happens
 
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
is an unspoken quid pro quo
 
01:37:50.090 --> 01:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
you support the school budget
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'll support the town budget
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
and vice versa
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
so now you've got these two lock step
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
votes but they've already voted you
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
already know their position because
 
01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
they're members of those committees
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
so really those appointed members
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
should be advisory only
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
and it's the members that are elected to
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
the budget committee
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
the at-large members those are the
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
people that should be the voting members
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
now I've heard it said
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
they won't show up
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
they won't help
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
and you're going to be working in a
 
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
and you're going to be working in a
vacuum

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
vacuum
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
there is no way
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
that a select board or a school board is
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to choose to not participate in
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
budget committee meetings because they
 
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
don't have a vote because it is still in
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
their best interest
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
to Advocate and defend for the budget
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine that a school board or a
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
select board would say you know what
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
screw it we're not going to send we're
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
not going to send a pardon my French I
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
apologize Mr Speaker that was a little
 
01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
bit off color
 
01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:13.139 align:start position:0%
we're not going to show up you know just
 
01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:15.500 align:start position:0%
let them let them do what they want that
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
would never happen because it's in their
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
best interest to protect those budgets
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple change
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
to make budget committees a more
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
Equitable more properly representative
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
committee by allowing the the votes to
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
be made by the voting members only and
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
having the appointed members to Simply
 
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
Be advisory and for that reason I ask
 
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
you I implore you I beg you to support
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
know that stripping a select board and
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
School Board representative votes on any
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment offered by a municipal budget
 
01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.129 align:start position:0%
Amendment offered by a municipal budget
committee

01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
to a municipal budget committee
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
operating budget as well as their votes
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
on the final Municipal budget committee
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget weakens the budget development
 
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.010 align:start position:0%
budget weakens the budget development
process

01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I further know that
 
01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
the select board and school board
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
members would not even count towards a
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
quorum of the committee
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
putting the posted meeting at risk of
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
failing to even have a quorum
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
and that will put the budget process at
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
risk then Mr Speaker would I oppose the
 
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion so that another
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%

01:43:04.129 --> 01:43:04.139 align:start position:0%
about quorums this is about voting on
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
the budget that they already voted on
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
once already and if I know that we
 
01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
created this law to give the taxpayers a
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
Fail-Safe a backstop to double check the
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
budget and if I further know that
 
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
allowing them to vote on it hinders that
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
we originally intended to do would I
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
vote to support this bill so that the
 
01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:30.179 align:start position:0%

inexpedient to legislate so Lori staff

guarantee I would never get the same

answer twice
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
good cause is ambiguous how can we as

on such ambiguous guidance

this ambiguity leads to corruption and
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
nepotism there are two btla court cases
 
01:59:43.370 --> 01:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
that show how good cause abatements were
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
abused and overturned they were in

in the court documents for the Berlin
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
case this corruption was on full display
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
when the dra stated that the facts
 
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
demonstrate inequity and self-dealing on
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
the part of the board of assessors just
 
02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
think about that inequity and
 
02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.510 align:start position:0%
think about that inequity and
self-dealing

02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
self-dealing
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
during the town of ossipee's btla
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
hearing department of revenue Chief
 
02:00:18.890 --> 02:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
assessor Philip Bodwell gave the dra
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
definition of good cause to mean
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
assessment or evaluation errors and
 
02:00:23.159 --> 02:00:25.010 align:start position:0%
assessment or evaluation errors and
hardship

02:00:25.010 --> 02:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
the btla agrees with this definition my
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
bill expands Upon A dra definition to
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
include administrative and clerical
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
errors and poverty
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
poverty replaces the hardship definition
 
02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
because it can be clearly defined using
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
federal poverty guidelines as stated in
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
this bill does not tie the hands of
 
02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
elected officials as some would say
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually it gives elected officials and
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
assessors freedom to make sound decisive
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
and fair decisions that will keep
 
02:00:58.729 --> 02:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
personal opinions bias and nepotism from
 
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
the decision to Abate taxes
 
02:01:02.570 --> 02:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
this bill brings transparency
 
02:01:04.370 --> 02:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
accountability and a government that
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
works for all the people
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
let me ask every member of this chamber
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
a part in question why would I as the
 
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
chair of my town select board create a
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
bill that would undermine the ability or
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
the authority of the board on which I
 
02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.410 align:start position:0%
the authority of the board on which I
serve

02:01:18.410 --> 02:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
serve
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
I ask you to press the red button so
 
02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker HP 403 seeks to make a
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
seemingly innocuous change in the
 
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
wording of RSA 7616
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
this is the law that grants authority to
 
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
select board members and assessors to
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
Abate residential taxes
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
a casual reading of that change that
 
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes might lead you to
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
believe that there's nothing major at
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
stake here it's just housekeeping
 
02:02:01.609 --> 02:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
you might look at the notion of
 
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
substituting administrative or clerical
 
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
errors for these existing laws term good
 
02:02:10.729 --> 02:02:10.739 align:start position:0%
cause shown as inconsequential maybe
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
even a good idea
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
but good cause isn't just any term it
 
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
has legal heft
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
it can be used in a courtroom to prove a
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient reason for a ruling or an
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
action by a judge in fact it's often
 
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
used to place the burden on the litigant
 
02:02:30.649 --> 02:02:30.659 align:start position:0%
to show why exactly a request should be
 
02:02:33.169 --> 02:02:33.179 align:start position:0%
refused or granted
 
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
in the case of RSA 76 the term good
 
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
cause does exactly that
 
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
it places the burden on the select board
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
and assessors to demonstrate objective
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
evidence that the original assessment
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
was incorrect
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
during our hearing of HB 403 we could we
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't quite nail down exactly what
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
might constitute an administrative or
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
clerical error we were left to conclude
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
this was not such an innocuous or
 
02:03:03.649 --> 02:03:03.659 align:start position:0%
housekeeping change in language after
 
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
all what the bill really proposes is
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
removing the legal authority to Grant
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
abatements from those in whom such
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
Authority is vested
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
we thought this to be unwise we believed
 
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
the drafters of the existing law were
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
onto something and that something
 
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't be changed I urge you
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
to support the committee's
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpedient to

the motion before us
 
02:03:42.169 --> 02:03:42.179 align:start position:0%
is the majority committee report of in

the vision has been requested members
 
02:04:07.609 --> 02:04:07.619 align:start position:0%

the motion before us is the majority

02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Jonathan
 
02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
if I know that good cause is ambiguous
 
02:05:18.589 --> 02:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
and that the dra and btla have defined
 
02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
good cause if I know that this bill
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
defines good cause more broadly than the
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
ptla and dra by including poverty if I
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
know that this bill will bring
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
transparency accountability to the
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
decision to obey taxes which should
 
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
never be used as tools for favors and
 
02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
self-dealing would I now press the red
 
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
button so another motion can be made
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill does not define
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
administrative or clerical errors or has
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
anything different than for good cause
 
02:05:59.689 --> 02:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
if I know that administrative and
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
clerical errors are already reasons for
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
a good cause for abatements and if I
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
know that as a select board member for
 
02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:11.219 align:start position:0%
over 16 years I have put my signature to
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
abatements for good cause
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
of these limitations and Beyond

recommendation that the bill ought to

those opposed May
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
you guys have it and the committee

applying for a Convention of the states
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
under Article 5 of The Constitution of
 
02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
the United States have been considered
 
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
the same report this same with the
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation of Bill ought to pass
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's on a brand Infinity for the
 
02:14:40.079 --> 02:14:41.270 align:start position:0%
it's on a brand Infinity for the
committee

02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker I'll uh I
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
think there's eight more votes between
 
02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
us and lunch so hopefully I'll try to
 
02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
keep it brief and I rise in opposition
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
to hcr1 a resolution applying for a
 
02:15:11.089 --> 02:15:11.099 align:start position:0%
Convention of the states under Article 5
 
02:15:12.770 --> 02:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
of the constant
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
States and I'm
 
02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that any Article Five
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
constitution convention could easily
 
02:15:22.669 --> 02:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
turn to The Runaway convention and the
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
way HDR is written this one
 
02:15:27.290 --> 02:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
is probably almost guaranteed to turn to
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
Runaway uh convention the first two
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
items are so vague
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
and so far-reaching as you pretty much
 
02:15:37.310 --> 02:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
guarantee if a runaway convention and
 
02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's really unclear why such a
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
convention is even necessary I'm
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
certainly not saying the federal
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
government is perfect but
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's already under quote fiscal
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
constraints unquote and I don't even
 
02:15:50.089 --> 02:15:50.099 align:start position:0%
really know exactly what that term means
 
02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
but obviously it has a limited amount of
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
money even though it's fast but limited
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
and the power and jurisdiction the
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
federal government has already limited
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
the third topic is term limits and
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
I know that's a fashionable idea in some
 
02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
circles where we the people have been
 
02:16:08.089 --> 02:16:08.099 align:start position:0%
rejecting the idea of congressional term
 
02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
limits every election cycle every two
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
years when we democratically re-elect
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
congresspersons and Senators who have
 
02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
been serving for a long time more than
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
and uh as I said it's far from perfect
 
02:16:22.129 --> 02:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
but it's not totally out of control I
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
think it still operates within the
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
bounds of the United States Constitution
 
02:16:25.199 --> 02:16:26.270 align:start position:0%
bounds of the United States Constitution
and

02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
I spent the last 15 years of my life in
 
02:16:30.290 --> 02:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
state government I love all three
 
02:16:32.089 --> 02:16:32.099 align:start position:0%
branches in my state government but the
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
federal government is not necessarily uh
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
more regressive less responsive or more
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
oppressive than the state governments
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
usually allowed the not in our state so
 
02:16:45.889 --> 02:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
much but actually a lot of the worst um
 
02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
the worst offenses against Liberty
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
actually take place at the state level
 
02:16:50.690 --> 02:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh even more so than at the federal
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
level and um
 
02:16:57.410 --> 02:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going first and uh so nobody has
 
02:16:58.849 --> 02:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
talked about the debt so I won't go into
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
too much detail except to say that uh
 
02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
the idea that debt the federal
 
02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
government is actually having uh
 
02:17:08.330 --> 02:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
no trouble uh selling dead instruments
 
02:17:10.490 --> 02:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
only about a tenth of the figure you see
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
is actually debt that's over by the
 
02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
federal government to entities other
 
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
than the government uh
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
about 70 percent of it is the money
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
supply and uh sure we have uh the Euro
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
crypto we have a bunch of other
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
currencies but the US dollar is still
 
02:17:28.929 --> 02:17:28.939 align:start position:0%
the world's
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
Reserve currency is still the strongest
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
currency in the world about 70 percent
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
of that is our money supply and also a
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
lot of it is also
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
debt when Federal agency owes to another
 
02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
Federal agency so it's actually about
 
02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
one-tenth the figure you see and it's uh
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:17:46.849 --> 02:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
if there's any consolation
 
02:17:48.770 --> 02:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
we're a debt creditor to the rest of the
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
world so they owe us uh the rest of the
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
world owes the United States about 13
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars so we're actually like
 
02:17:57.770 --> 02:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
making out on the deal so
 
02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
so in any case this uh resolution is
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and I urge you to uh
 
02:18:14.089 --> 02:18:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.810 --> 02:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:18:24.889 --> 02:18:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and your
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
patience today
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
Article 5 of the U.S Constitution reads
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
in part
 
02:18:33.530 --> 02:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
the Congress whenever two-thirds of both
 
02:18:37.370 --> 02:18:37.380 align:start position:0%

02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
propose amendments to this constitution
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%

02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
legislatures of two-thirds of the
 
02:18:47.089 --> 02:18:47.099 align:start position:0%
several States shall call a convention
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
for proposing amendments
 
02:18:51.530 --> 02:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
the application for a Convention of
 
02:18:53.570 --> 02:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
states is important for specific
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
amendments that impose fiscal restraints
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
on the federal government
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
to limit the power and the jurisdiction
 
02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
of the federal government and to limit
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
the terms of office for members of
 
02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
the terms of office for members of
Congress

02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
this committee agrees that Congress has
 
02:19:09.889 --> 02:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
neglected their duties and ignored the
 
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
United States Congress has usurped
 
02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
states rights
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
they've driven up the national debt with
 
02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
Reckless monetary policy
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
and corruption with campaign funding and
 
02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
electoral Monopoly
 
02:19:33.049 --> 02:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain the checks and
 
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
balances outlined in the Constitution
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
the states must call a Convention of
 
02:19:39.049 --> 02:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
states to propose these specific
 
02:19:39.059 --> 02:19:41.150 align:start position:0%
states to propose these specific
amendments

02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
let me be very clear right now
 
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
in Article 5 convention is not a
 
02:19:51.849 --> 02:19:51.859 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention that has been
 
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
misrepresented over and over again
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
through the years that our committee has
 
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
heard this issue
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention is only to
 
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
propose amendments only amendments to
 
02:20:04.370 --> 02:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
the Constitution it is not to rewrite
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
the Constitution to remake it to remold
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
it to do anything
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
other than to propose amendments for
 
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:16.849 --> 02:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as a runaway
 
02:20:16.859 --> 02:20:18.290 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as a runaway
convention

02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
convention
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
it is a myth
 
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
perpetuated by people that don't
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%

02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have a duty
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
to Future generations to protect their
 
02:20:42.479 --> 02:20:43.490 align:start position:0%
to Future generations to protect their
rights

02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
to protect the Integrity of our economy
 
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
and elections and to rebalance state
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
federal power
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention is the safest
 
02:20:55.849 --> 02:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
non-violent and bipartisan way to reform
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
the government to use the Constitution
 
02:20:59.929 --> 02:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
that we are all sworn to protect and to
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
as of today
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
39 states have passed a valid
 
02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
application for a convention for fiscal
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility alone
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
while 19 States total have passed
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
applications for for a convention to
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
propose all three amendments
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
we can be the the 20th State
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
to tell our federal Congress that they
 
02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:27.410 align:start position:0%
to tell our federal Congress that they
suck

02:21:27.410 --> 02:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:29.410 --> 02:21:29.420 align:start position:0%
it is all right that's that's
 
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
over 400 applications since 1788 400
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
applications for a Convention of states
 
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
have been passed
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
since 1789 Congress has proposed 12 000
 
02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
since 1789 Congress has proposed 12 000
amendments

02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:21:54.290 --> 02:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
33 proposed amendments to the state's
 
02:21:58.370 --> 02:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
ratification have been sent but only 27
 
02:22:00.889 --> 02:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
have been ratified by
 
02:22:03.530 --> 02:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
by the required uh percentage of states
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
to prevent future corporatism and
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
plutocracy that is infesting our country
 
02:22:15.050 --> 02:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
currently a Convention of states is the
 
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
to reform the government to make it work
 
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
for the people again and to force
 
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
Congress to stop ignoring us
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
and the only reason I'm so
 
02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
aggressive about this issue is because
 
02:22:32.210 --> 02:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
we are 32 trillion dollars in debt
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anyone understands how
 
02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
a Psalms Duty
 
02:22:53.210 --> 02:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
as a legislature
 
02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
as a governing body
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
to send a message to Congress that we're
 
02:23:00.349 --> 02:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
not playing around anymore
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
Congress has ignored us ignored the
 
02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:03.469 align:start position:0%
Congress has ignored us ignored the
people

02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
and driven our country into the
 
02:23:07.490 --> 02:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
extremism and political apathy that we
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
see today something has to give and
 
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
something has to change
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
we can be a part of that change
 
02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
if we're brave enough
 
02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
to vote in favor of the ought to pass
 
02:23:21.170 --> 02:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
for hcr1
 
02:23:23.690 --> 02:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
for only the application for a
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
Convention of states to utilize the
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
power that the founders gave us who had
 
02:23:30.730 --> 02:23:30.740 align:start position:0%
the foresight to understand as societal
 
02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
cultural and technological Evolution
 
02:23:35.210 --> 02:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
will happen in our society and the only
 
02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
way that that we can change it is to use
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that we're all sworn to
 
02:23:43.969 --> 02:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
protect please vote in favor of hcr1
 
02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
today thank you

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's one thing I have learned in 19
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
years in this house
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
is then when you're speaking on one of
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
the last Bills on the calendar and the
 
02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
second day of the session in the middle
 
02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
of winter be brief and I will
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker there's a lot of questions
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
and concerns about the bill before the
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh house Resolute house concurrent
 
02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
resolution before us
 
02:24:22.490 --> 02:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
first of all in the history of our
 
02:24:25.610 --> 02:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
nation there's only been one Article 5
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
convention that was in 1787.
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
this would be the second if was accepted
 
02:24:35.809 --> 02:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
since that time
 
02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
there have been 27 Amendments passed to
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
our constitution including to us
 
02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
probably the most important 10
 
02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
the first in our Bill of Rights
 
02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
02:24:52.730 --> 02:24:52.740 align:start position:0%

02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
it's the groups
 
02:25:08.809 --> 02:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
that have come together in opposition to
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
the premise of an article 5 convention
 
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
when you have the AFL-CIO
 
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
and you have the John Burke Society
 
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
and when you have
 
02:25:25.090 --> 02:25:25.100 align:start position:0%
common cause
 
02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
NAACP the League of Women Voters the

all uniting on one purpose to stop the
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary need of an article five
 
02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
convention concerned about questions
 
02:25:48.170 --> 02:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
about where the money is coming from the
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
supporting this movement and for those
 
02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
that have concerns about what an article
 
02:25:56.270 --> 02:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
5 convention could do to some of the
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
most important amendments in our
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
constitution as they stand today I would
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
ask this chamber to please vote red so
 
02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
another motion could be made and thank
 
02:26:07.969 --> 02:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Dan
 
02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:13.910 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Dan
Maguire

02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
have you ever wondered why you're paid
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
200 for this session
 
02:26:24.889 --> 02:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
the answer is it's due to the great
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
railroad Scandal of 1887 and the
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
outrageous spending that was taking
 
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
place in this room
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
and as a consequence the people put
 
02:26:37.730 --> 02:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
together a convention to propose the
 
02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
amendment to the to our Constitution
 
02:26:42.889 --> 02:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
that sets our salary
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
but I'll go into more detail in a minute
 
02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
but before I get to that let's motivate
 
02:26:50.570 --> 02:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
um hcr1
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
so we've heard about the tremendous debt
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
of the federal government 30 something
 
02:26:59.330 --> 02:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars but I want to I want to
 
02:27:01.849 --> 02:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
put that into context
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
one out of every 250 people in the
 
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
United States lives in New Hampshire
 
02:27:11.690 --> 02:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
that makes our share of that trillion 30
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars about 125 billion
 
02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:16.910 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars about 125 billion
dollars

02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the total value of
 
02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
all real property in New Hampshire all
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
commercial property all residential
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
property that's also about 125 billion
 
02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:30.469 align:start position:0%
property that's also about 125 billion
dollars

02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
so if we need wanted to pay back our
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
part of this debt
 
02:27:38.210 --> 02:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
that would be like adding a new mortgage
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
a new second mortgage on every property
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
owner in the state commercial and
 
02:27:43.439 --> 02:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
owner in the state commercial and
residential

02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
residential
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
with no down payment starting at zero
 
02:27:50.690 --> 02:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
right that's what we have to do to pay
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
back that debt that that doesn't include
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded liabilities so add another
 
02:27:58.250 --> 02:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
mortgage for Social Security at another
 
02:28:00.889 --> 02:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
mortgage for other unfunded liabilities
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
and you can see how outrageous their
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.969 --> 02:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
now I don't really blame the people in
 
02:28:10.979 --> 02:28:12.590 align:start position:0%
now I don't really blame the people in
Congress

02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
um for this debt it's it's we sought
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves yesterday
 
02:28:20.210 --> 02:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
when we passed spending bill after
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
spending bill
 
02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
but we are limited by reality
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know the money tree that the Ways
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee keeps locked in
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
their closet only has so many leaves on
 
02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:33.230 align:start position:0%
their closet only has so many leaves on
it

02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:28:35.690 --> 02:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
so you know we can pass as many spending
 
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
bills as you want but at the end of the
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
day the amount we are actually going to
 
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
spend is limited right but in Washington
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
they've discovered that there are no
 
02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:46.250 align:start position:0%
they've discovered that there are no
limits

02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
limits
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
right they they can create dollars and
 
02:28:51.530 --> 02:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
they can spend and that's where
 
02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
inflation comes from
 
02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:54.950 align:start position:0%
inflation comes from
okay

02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
so the only way we can limit them is via
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that's the purpose of a
 
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
constitution is to put limits on
 
02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
government and our U.S Constitution is
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
relatively silent about spending it has
 
02:29:11.929 --> 02:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
some stuff about money mostly about how
 
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
to turn metal into coins and stuff like
 
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
that right but but it re the only thing
 
02:29:19.730 --> 02:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
it talks about with spending is the 10th
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment which says if we didn't give
 
02:29:24.889 --> 02:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
you a specific okay to do something you
 
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
can't do it right well that turned out
 
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
to be too vague to be enforceable
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
all right so we need to put some limits
 
02:29:37.130 --> 02:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
on Congress and their fiscal
 
02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
um outrageousness and this is our way of
 
02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
doing it because we can't we can't
 
02:29:46.730 --> 02:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
Congress it's unreasonable to expect
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
Congress to put in a constitutional
 
02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
amendment to restrict their own power
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
right we wouldn't do that to ourselves
 
02:29:58.610 --> 02:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
so when when the people wanted to
 
02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
restrict our salaries they had to do it
 
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
themselves they had to put in their own
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment and pass it
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
themselves and that's what happened to
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
us so in 1887
 
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
um at the time this was this is at the
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
time when that clock was still under
 
02:30:23.809 --> 02:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
um they were the representatives in this
 
02:30:29.929 --> 02:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
room 307 of them were paid three dollars
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
a day per diem
 
02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
so at the time the average salary in New
 
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was 14 cents an hour
 
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay today the average salary is 25 an
 
02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
hour so that three dollars per diem is
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
like 500 a day
 
02:30:50.210 --> 02:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
that's how much they were paid okay and
 
02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
they met starting in June June 1st
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
because notice that this was part of the
 
02:30:58.250 --> 02:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
building uh first of all it's it's was
 
02:31:00.889 --> 02:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
unheated at the time but it also has no
 
02:31:00.899 --> 02:31:02.210 align:start position:0%
unheated at the time but it also has no
bathrooms

02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
bathrooms
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
right all the bathrooms are in the 1910
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
section over there right so so we're
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
talking outhouses and
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
um so at the time they were paying paid
 
02:31:16.010 --> 02:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
three dollars a day and they had this
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
giant Scandal dealing with railroads and
 
02:31:20.450 --> 02:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
bills and so on and they stayed in
 
02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
session and paid themselves for 158 days
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
straight June 1st to November 5th
 
02:31:28.610 --> 02:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
so they paid themselves including
 
02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
weekends even though they were here
 
02:31:33.530 --> 02:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
three or four days a week so that was so
 
02:31:37.849 --> 02:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
outrageous that 474 dollars each was so
 
02:31:40.250 --> 02:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
outrageous that the people put a stop to
 
02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:41.090 align:start position:0%
outrageous that the people put a stop to
it

02:31:41.090 --> 02:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
and look at what they gave us right that
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
simple thing and by the way they also
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
moved the session to January at the same
 
02:31:53.090 --> 02:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
time right so they they reduced our
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
salary made us meet in the winter so we
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
would get through quicker all right all
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
right so
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and look at what that gave us that
 
02:32:07.610 --> 02:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
gave us this fantastic legislature this
 
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
volunteer legislature you know over time
 
02:32:12.650 --> 02:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
over those hundred and some years
 
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
we have this fantastic legislature I
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
would pit the life experience in this
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
room against any other such room in the
 
02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
country including the Congress
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
all right so this is our way
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
of doing something right
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
for the United States for the for our
 
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
spending for our fiscal restraints so
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
please join me in pushing the green
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:37:22.490 --> 02:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
if I know the founding fathers in their
 
02:37:28.010 --> 02:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
wisdom allowed the creation of
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
amendments for improving the
 
02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
amendments for improving the
Constitution

02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
and they also understood the effects of
 
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
power and authority on human nature
 
02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
if I also believe that article 5
 
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
was given to us as a system of checks
 
02:37:48.050 --> 02:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
and balances
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
to use when Congress refuses to act on
 
02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
the concerns of We the People
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
if I know that both faith and fear ask
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
us to believe in something that we
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
cannot see
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
and leaves the choice up to us
 
02:38:09.889 --> 02:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
and if I'm certain that the founding
 
02:38:12.530 --> 02:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
fathers had faith that future
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
Generations would use an article 5
 
02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:17.570 align:start position:0%
Generations would use an article 5
wisely

02:38:17.570 --> 02:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
wisely
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
and only when necessary
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
would you now join me in choosing faith
 
02:38:25.849 --> 02:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
in the process that the founding fathers
 
02:38:28.250 --> 02:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
left We the People
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%

it has for most promotion the motion is
 
02:39:59.929 --> 02:39:59.939 align:start position:0%
to an expedient to legislate in HCR one
 
02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise to
 
02:40:03.650 --> 02:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
State your motion I move to table hcr1
 
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
it is a higher motion so the motion
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
before us is the table hcr1
 
02:40:16.010 --> 02:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:47.880 align:start position:0%

the motion before us is the table hcr1
 
02:41:12.410 --> 02:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
02:41:17.150 --> 02:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
Charlotte for a parliamentary inquiry
 
02:41:19.849 --> 02:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:41:23.450 --> 02:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
know that HCR one has been well vetted
 
02:41:25.969 --> 02:41:25.979 align:start position:0%
and not committed and that we've all
 
02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
received much information about this
 
02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
issue but Mr Speaker if I feel that hcl1
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
is not right for the people of the
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
Granite State
 
02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
what I now push the red button to defeat
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the motion to table so another motion
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
oh yeah the chair recognizes
 
02:41:53.090 --> 02:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative hole for a parliamentary
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
if I know that our national debt is now
 
02:42:03.290 --> 02:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
over 30 trillion dollars
 
02:42:05.809 --> 02:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
given the 330 million Americans that's
 
02:42:07.730 --> 02:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
almost a hundred thousand dollars per
 
02:42:10.030 --> 02:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
person in national debt
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
if I further know that Congress isn't
 
02:42:14.929 --> 02:42:14.939 align:start position:0%
listening to us
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
and that's said on both sides of the
 
02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
and that's said on both sides of the
aisle

02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
aisle
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's not a a republican thing or a
 
02:42:22.610 --> 02:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
Democrat thing there are people across
 
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the Spectrum who believe that is what's
 
02:42:27.469 --> 02:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
in happening in Congress is broken
 
02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
if I further know that we had a good
 
02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
debate and the committee recommended
 
02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
ought to pass but that was not decided

1999 there have been well over 300
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%

cause of death among American children

and teens
 
02:48:08.450 --> 02:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
large capacity magazines result in 14
 
02:48:10.969 --> 02:48:10.979 align:start position:0%
times as many people being killed or
 
02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
wounded during a shooting event and
 
02:48:16.450 --> 02:48:16.460 align:start position:0%
between 2009 and 2018
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%

high-capacity magazines

Banning assault rifles and large
 
02:48:27.650 --> 02:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
capacity magazines is common sense
 
02:48:30.349 --> 02:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
ending ownership of these weapons of
 
02:48:32.270 --> 02:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
mass destruction should not be an issue
 
02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
of political ideology there is no valid
 
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
moral or ethical stance that can support
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the right of someone to own a gun that
 
02:48:43.730 --> 02:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
can kill many school children in the
 
02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
blink of an eye it is our moral calling
 
02:48:49.610 --> 02:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
to put an end to the senseless Slaughter
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the innocent and protect our children
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
I'll say that one more time it is our
 
02:48:57.410 --> 02:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
moral calling to put an end to the
 
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
senseless Slaughter of the innocent and
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
protect our children
 
02:49:04.610 --> 02:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
Common Sense gun control measures such
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
as these are proven effective Research
 
02:49:09.530 --> 02:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
indicates that in states with
 
02:49:12.230 --> 02:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions on magazine size mass
 
02:49:14.330 --> 02:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
shootings occur at less than half the
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
rates of states without restrictions
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
in New Zealand in 2019 a gunman entered
 
02:49:24.370 --> 02:49:24.380 align:start position:0%
two mosques and killed 51 people
 
02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
injuring 40 more seven days later New
 
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
Zealand instituted a national ban on all
 
02:49:34.610 --> 02:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
semi-automatic weapons and later on all
 
02:49:37.370 --> 02:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
assault rifles and parts just one
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
massacre in New Zealand changed their
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
gun laws here in the United States we
 
02:49:44.690 --> 02:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
have let massacres happen over and over
 
02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
again with no action but we can change
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
that no one needs access to large
 
02:49:54.050 --> 02:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
capacity magazines or Weaponry that can
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
take out dozens of people within a few
 
02:49:59.570 --> 02:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
moments these are weapons that bring
 
02:50:02.809 --> 02:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
only the mass murder of Americans we can
 
02:50:06.349 --> 02:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
put an end to such horrific and needless
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
Bloodshed with common sense gun control
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%

the 20th century is filled with millions

of reasons to never permit a government

ownership was banned by those leaders

contrary to what the president May
 
02:51:49.490 --> 02:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
repeat in front of the cameras our
 
02:51:51.170 --> 02:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
natural right to keep and bear arms is
 
02:51:53.210 --> 02:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
not so we can go deer hunting or sport

supporters of the federal assault

weapons ban will Echo the refrain that
 
02:52:02.750 --> 02:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
the founders could not have imagined
 
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:06.020 align:start position:0%
modern Firearms but cannons existed
 
02:52:08.330 --> 02:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
privateer's own Battleship equivalents
 
02:52:09.530 --> 02:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
02:52:11.150 --> 02:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
the founders were fully aware of the
 
02:52:13.370 --> 02:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
evolution of arms and that is evident by
 
02:52:16.910 --> 02:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
the use of that specific word arms in
 
02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment not just muskets
 
02:52:22.130 --> 02:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
not just Swords not just pistols no such
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
limitation is defined
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
in Congress last session H.R 1808 was
 
02:52:30.530 --> 02:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
the proposed assault weapon ban of 2022.
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
the bill swept so broadly that it would
 
02:52:34.490 --> 02:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
have made millions of owned firearms
 
02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
illegal overnight also including several
 
02:52:39.349 --> 02:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
hunting rifle and shotgun models
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
during the hearing Congressman Dan
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
Bishop asked would anyone on the other
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
side dispute that this bill would ban
 
02:52:47.210 --> 02:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
weapons that are in common use in the
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
U.S today
 
02:52:51.290 --> 02:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
chairman Jerry Nadler replied that's the
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
point of the bill
 
02:52:55.010 --> 02:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
this flies directly in the face of dcv
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
Heller where the Supreme Court held that
 
02:52:59.210 --> 02:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
arms in common use
 
02:53:00.650 --> 02:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
we're protected under the Second
 
02:53:00.660 --> 02:53:01.550 align:start position:0%
we're protected under the Second
Amendment

02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
this alone makes any bans
 
02:53:06.050 --> 02:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional based on President H.R
 
02:53:08.269 --> 02:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
1808 also Exempted all Departments of
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government from the ban
 
02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
all departments Congressman Thomas
 
02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
Massey attempted to amend the build
 
02:53:16.490 --> 02:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
clarifying that of course this wouldn't
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
include the Departments of education and
 
02:53:18.479 --> 02:53:20.570 align:start position:0%
include the Departments of education and
agriculture

02:53:20.570 --> 02:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
since the bill supporters keep referring
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
to AR-15s as weapons of war and only
 
02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
useful for mass murder why would
 
02:53:29.929 --> 02:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
Department of teachers or Farmers need
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
this when answering this very question
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bill supporter said because they may

murder or just war and apparently the
 
02:53:44.929 --> 02:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
rest of our lives aren't important
 
02:53:46.670 --> 02:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
enough to let us defend ourselves in the

same manner
 
02:53:49.370 --> 02:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
this type of Monopoly of force is

precisely the outcome the founders

wish to keep our families safe
 
02:56:05.210 --> 02:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
and if I know that policies such as this
 
02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
one encourage and support responsible

gun ownership
 
02:56:11.570 --> 02:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
are proven to reduce fatalities and

injuries caused by mass shootings events
 
02:56:17.690 --> 02:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
and ultimately protect our children not
 
02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
just for mass shootings but also from
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
the traumatic and very real fear that

Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
02:56:41.570 --> 02:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
CDC reported A Renewed assault weapon
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
ban would have no measurable different
 
02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
difference on gun violence and if I know
 
02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
any Bill Banning firearms and common
 
02:56:50.210 --> 02:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
usage violates Heller Vs DC ruling and
 
02:56:52.250 --> 02:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
if I know that Columbine occurred during
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
the last Federal assault weapons ban and
 
02:56:56.450 --> 02:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
if I further know that we only have to
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
look at the last century to see the
 
02:56:59.570 --> 02:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
disastrous outcome of governments having
 
02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:02.399 align:start position:0%

02:59:56.510 --> 02:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative Madison Miller is

03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues if I know that
 
03:00:11.389 --> 03:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
President Harry Truman and secretary
 
03:00:13.969 --> 03:00:13.979 align:start position:0%
George Marshall had the wisdom in
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
foresight after the second world war to
 
03:00:19.490 --> 03:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
know that economic desperation is a
 
03:00:22.309 --> 03:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
breeding ground for authoritarianism
 
03:00:24.349 --> 03:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the original Marshall
 
03:00:27.650 --> 03:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
Plan put a devastated Europe back on its
 
03:00:30.170 --> 03:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
feet and likely saved the world from
 
03:00:32.929 --> 03:00:32.939 align:start position:0%
plunging into chaos for a third time
 
03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that those same
 
03:00:38.750 --> 03:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
feelings of desperation exist in many
 
03:00:41.809 --> 03:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
American communities today such as the
 
03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
flooded Kentucky Hills the shells of
 
03:00:47.389 --> 03:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
factories in Michigan and the bone dry
 
03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
former lakes in Utah
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
and lastly if I know that the
 
03:00:54.830 --> 03:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
preservation of democracy requires a
 
03:00:56.990 --> 03:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
belief in the future for subsequent
 
03:00:59.809 --> 03:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
Generations would I not push the red
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
button to overturn the Ito and send a
 
03:01:06.170 --> 03:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
message to Washington that it's time for
 
03:01:08.030 --> 03:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
a martial like plan for the United
 
03:01:12.230 --> 03:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:14.210 --> 03:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative Mendon is recognized for
 
03:01:16.010 --> 03:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
03:01:18.710 --> 03:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
03:01:22.250 --> 03:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:24.650 --> 03:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
before in history with large portions of
 
03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
that money being misappropriated or
 
03:01:28.910 --> 03:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
going unaccounted for and if I know that
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
a project of this size would undoubtedly
 
03:01:33.250 --> 03:01:33.260 align:start position:0%
inject trillions more into the 32.5
 
03:01:36.769 --> 03:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
trillion national debt a debt of jet a
 
03:01:39.950 --> 03:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
debt to GDP ratio of 120 percent and if
 
03:01:41.450 --> 03:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
I know that the inflation reduction act
 
03:01:44.570 --> 03:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
added positions for 87 000 IRS agents to
 
03:01:46.490 --> 03:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
squeeze taxes from us to compensate
 
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
Unstoppable federal spending and if I
 
03:01:51.170 --> 03:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
further know that we are experiencing
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
rapid inflation due to these federal
 
03:01:55.550 --> 03:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
spending sprees and that inflation is
 
03:01:58.610 --> 03:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
the one of the most Insidious taxes and
 
03:01:59.929 --> 03:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
03:02:01.730 --> 03:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
taxation is theft then I would press the
 
03:02:05.389 --> 03:02:05.399 align:start position:0%

would protect the Constitution
 
03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
and the Constitution says that taxation
 
03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
is one of our duties and a member said
 
03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:23.210 align:start position:0%
is one of our duties and a member said
that

03:04:23.210 --> 03:04:23.220 align:start position:0%

03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this is a bill that came
 
03:06:31.490 --> 03:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
before us to Grant to send a house
 
03:06:33.769 --> 03:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
resolution to Washington asking the
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
District of Columbia be granted
 
03:06:35.580 --> 03:06:36.710 align:start position:0%
District of Columbia be granted
statehood

03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
statehood
 
03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
and um I would say to you a couple of
 
03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
things about the district first of all
 
03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
the residents of the District of
 
03:06:43.740 --> 03:06:45.110 align:start position:0%
the residents of the District of
Columbia

03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
Columbia
 
03:06:48.170 --> 03:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
have every responsibility you and I have
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
as American citizens
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
they serve our country in time of peace
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
and War they pay their federal taxes and
 
03:06:59.330 --> 03:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
they contribute in so many other ways
 
03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
they contribute in so many other ways
however

03:07:00.710 --> 03:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:07:02.650 --> 03:07:02.660 align:start position:0%
they don't get to elect the president
 
03:07:06.410 --> 03:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
they have won person that represents
 
03:07:09.469 --> 03:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
them in Congress and without the full
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
voting Powers as a member of Congress
 
03:07:16.010 --> 03:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
lastly next to the last thing Washington
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
DC has a population of 700 plus thousand
 
03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:21.050 align:start position:0%
DC has a population of 700 plus thousand
people

03:07:21.050 --> 03:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
which makes it almost 200 000 people
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
more than the state of Wyoming but yet
 
03:07:29.570 --> 03:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
again they have no full rights as
 
03:07:31.370 --> 03:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
American citizens
 
03:07:33.769 --> 03:07:33.779 align:start position:0%
and I think it's almost
 
03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say this delicately as
 
03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
some of us may have learned over the
 
03:07:39.769 --> 03:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
past few years it may be important for
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
Washington the District of Columbia to
 
03:07:44.690 --> 03:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
be a state and to have a governor
 
03:07:46.969 --> 03:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
instead of a mayor and I would ask you
 
03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
to vote red on the itl so another motion
 
03:07:51.410 --> 03:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
could be brought forward thank you Mr
 
03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
could be brought forward thank you Mr
Speaker

03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:55.670 --> 03:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
the member from Loudoun representative
 
03:07:57.650 --> 03:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
Moffat is recognized speak in support of
 
03:08:05.269 --> 03:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:08:09.769 --> 03:08:09.779 align:start position:0%
I fed the occasion to spend a lot of
 
03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
time in DCS to be stationed down that
 
03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:13.130 align:start position:0%
time in DCS to be stationed down that
way

03:08:13.130 --> 03:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
among other reasons and I've noticed as
 
03:08:19.010 --> 03:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
probably many of you have you know folks
 
03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
here by our license plate which is
 
03:08:22.370 --> 03:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
famous they have a famous license plate
 
03:08:24.050 --> 03:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
out of DC
 
03:08:26.210 --> 03:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh it says taxation without
 
03:08:28.610 --> 03:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
representation and I get that
 
03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:29.690 align:start position:0%
representation and I get that
but

03:08:29.690 --> 03:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
even though 90 percent of the voters
 
03:08:35.090 --> 03:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
down there in D.C
 
03:08:38.210 --> 03:08:38.220 align:start position:0%
vote with the other party
 
03:08:40.130 --> 03:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
they apparently agree with many of the
 
03:08:42.530 --> 03:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
folks on on the red side of the house of
 
03:08:44.769 --> 03:08:44.779 align:start position:0%
this chamber that get ready for it
 
03:08:48.889 --> 03:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
so for something this important
 
03:08:55.550 --> 03:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
this should be bipartisan support
 
03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
but this is a very partisan proposal
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
the party for which 90 of the D.C
 
03:09:04.250 --> 03:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
residents vote of course they want D.C
 
03:09:06.769 --> 03:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
statehood the party for which 10 percent
 
03:09:09.410 --> 03:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
of the D.C residents vote see it
 
03:09:09.420 --> 03:09:10.849 align:start position:0%
of the D.C residents vote see it
otherwise

03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:09:13.150 --> 03:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
in D.C statehood would likely be
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Article 1 Section 8 of
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
The Constitution does say that Congress
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
should be in charge of the seat of
 
03:09:21.300 --> 03:09:22.670 align:start position:0%
should be in charge of the seat of
government

03:09:22.670 --> 03:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:09:24.590 --> 03:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
which will be quote from the
 
03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:26.030 align:start position:0%
which will be quote from the
Constitution

03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
District not exceeding 10 miles Square
 
03:09:32.450 --> 03:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
so this resolution favors something that
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
apparently is unconstitutional
 
03:09:37.490 --> 03:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
we should concern anyone who
 
03:09:40.370 --> 03:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
follows the Constitution
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
so the Constitution they think should
 
03:09:43.250 --> 03:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
outweigh politics and something as
 
03:09:46.010 --> 03:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
important as this now one remedy that
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
has been suggested that makes sense to
 
03:09:50.450 --> 03:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
me and others was shared with me by a
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
very prominent member of this house very
 
03:09:56.349 --> 03:09:56.359 align:start position:0%
prominent member I won't say who it was
 
03:09:59.809 --> 03:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
from our committee but I thought his uh
 
03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:02.300 align:start position:0%
thought to me was made a lot of sense
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
simply shrink the federal district down
 
03:10:08.210 --> 03:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
to the core of Washington
 
03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
where the capital and the Supreme Court
 
03:10:12.410 --> 03:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
and the White House and the monuments
 
03:10:14.090 --> 03:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
and the government buildings are there's
 
03:10:17.210 --> 03:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
your federal district and then uh the
 
03:10:19.969 --> 03:10:19.979 align:start position:0%
residential districts of uh DC would
 
03:10:21.530 --> 03:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
revert to Maryland
 
03:10:24.349 --> 03:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
to whom it once belonged
 
03:10:26.450 --> 03:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh Maryland would probably gain one
 
03:10:29.090 --> 03:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
congressional seat that's fine it's a
 
03:10:30.650 --> 03:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
better solution than creating a new
 
03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:32.690 align:start position:0%
better solution than creating a new
state

03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:10:35.570 --> 03:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
if the federal district became a part of
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
a new state think about what happened
 
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
then what kind of benefits did that new
 
03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
state of DC get the new state of DC I
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
think would do pretty well with the the
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
federal government as compared to say
 
03:10:50.330 --> 03:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
03:10:50.340 --> 03:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
so

03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:53.530 align:start position:0%
so
uh

03:10:53.530 --> 03:10:53.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:56.030 --> 03:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
Washington's NFL franchise is actually
 
03:10:57.530 --> 03:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
in Maryland
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
and if the D.C football team
 
03:11:03.530 --> 03:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
can still be called Washington while
 
03:11:06.050 --> 03:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
playing in Maryland I think the rest of
 
03:11:08.330 --> 03:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
DC could also
 
03:11:12.410 --> 03:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
survive that and the pirate the southern
 
03:11:14.870 --> 03:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
part of the original District included
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
the northern part of Virginia and that
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's happened the northern part of
 
03:11:20.530 --> 03:11:20.540 align:start position:0%
Virginia which was part of D.C
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
Alexandria in 1846 became part of
 
03:11:26.210 --> 03:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
Virginia so there was a president for
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
for that approach so I would simply ask
 
03:11:30.650 --> 03:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
that you please please support the
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:12:50.570 --> 03:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that currently the
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
federal government has significant
 
03:12:54.590 --> 03:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
control over DC's local Affairs
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
including its budget and laws
 
03:12:59.750 --> 03:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if I know that statehood would Grant
 
03:13:02.690 --> 03:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
DC greater autonomy to govern itself
 
03:13:04.670 --> 03:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
allowing residents to have more control
 
03:13:06.650 --> 03:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
over the decisions that affect their
 
03:13:09.650 --> 03:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
daily lives and if I know a majority of
 
03:13:12.410 --> 03:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
D.C residents support statehood and
 
03:13:14.690 --> 03:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
several National polls have also shown
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
majority support among Americans for D.C
 
03:13:18.889 --> 03:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
to become a state
 
03:13:21.290 --> 03:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
then would I press the red button to

03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%

out-of-state large energy companies
 
03:48:13.610 --> 03:48:13.620 align:start position:0%

Bernardi

04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:38.450 --> 04:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
so utilities are required to purchase a
 
04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
certain amount of Renewable Power
 
04:25:48.729 --> 04:25:48.739 align:start position:0%
and they can do that by
 
04:25:52.490 --> 04:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
renewable energy wrecks or Alternative
 
04:25:55.849 --> 04:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
Energy payments if they can't buy those
 
04:25:55.859 --> 04:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
Energy payments if they can't buy those
wrecks

04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:02.590 --> 04:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
so in order to do that
 
04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
they compile from certain large
 
04:26:07.610 --> 04:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
suppliers and get wrecks but they can
 
04:26:10.490 --> 04:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
also buy from any one of you or myself
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
who happen to have some solar generation
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
in our backyard or on our rooftops
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
if we file the paperwork then they buy
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
those wrecks directly if we don't file
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
the paperwork and it's a significant
 
04:26:29.570 --> 04:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
burden to do that
 
04:26:33.410 --> 04:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
then the utilities by Statute are
 
04:26:38.929 --> 04:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.410 --> 04:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
so in the process of doing that
 
04:26:44.809 --> 04:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
they do not then have to make those
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
Alternative Energy payments to make up
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of of renewable energy
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
credits that they need
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
so if we pass this bill we eliminate
 
04:27:00.969 --> 04:27:00.979 align:start position:0%
that sweeping provision it means
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
utilities are going to have to make more
 
04:27:07.250 --> 04:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
Alternative Energy payments
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
those payments are passed back to you
 
04:27:14.030 --> 04:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
the rate payers directly goes right
 
04:27:18.050 --> 04:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
straight through into your electric bill
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would would put about three
 
04:27:24.170 --> 04:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year back into the
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
into the rate payers of New Hampshire
 
04:27:29.630 --> 04:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
04:27:33.950 --> 04:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
a direct harm to the rate payers and the
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire particularly
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
at a time
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
when electric rates are as high as they
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
are as they are so I urge you to vote
 
04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
against this resolution against this
 
04:27:46.979 --> 04:27:49.490 align:start position:0%
against this resolution against this

House Bill 234
 
04:28:02.929 --> 04:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
ends a bad statute
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
that's been on the books and should not
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
be harming New Hampshire ratepayers
 
04:28:09.769 --> 04:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
the practice known as renewable energies
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
credit sweeping or wreck sweeping
 
04:28:15.050 --> 04:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
enables private multi-billion dollar
 
04:28:17.330 --> 04:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
out-of-state corporations and in-state
 
04:28:20.330 --> 04:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
utilities to use New Hampshire residents
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
Rex rather than purchasing them as
 
04:28:25.969 --> 04:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
they're obligated to do under law
 
04:28:27.469 --> 04:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
multiple licensed New Hampshire
 
04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys have concluded that this state
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
statute is an unconstitutional taking of
 
04:28:34.610 --> 04:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
private property and violates the
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
takings clause in part 1 article 12 of
 
04:28:38.870 --> 04:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution this
 
04:28:40.849 --> 04:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
property is not abandoned because
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
property only becomes abandoned under
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law if is left unclaimed
 
04:28:47.450 --> 04:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
for multiple years here the state seizes
 
04:28:49.370 --> 04:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
the property at the time that it is
 
04:28:52.130 --> 04:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
created there is no notice to the people
 
04:28:54.530 --> 04:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
whose wrecks are being swept this
 
04:28:56.630 --> 04:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
practice has helped ruin the wreck
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
market and should be overturned
 
04:29:00.590 --> 04:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
therefore I ask for your vote to end
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
this unconstitutional law that we should

billion dollars over the next 10 years

and if I know that renewable energy
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
certificates are the carrot in the
 
04:30:20.330 --> 04:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard they're the
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
incentive to get people to

create or acquire more renewable energy
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%

there's no reason for it to exist
 
04:30:42.649 --> 04:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
it isn't accomplishing anything
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%

and further Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:31:23.809 --> 04:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping is a practice that would
 
04:31:26.210 --> 04:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
save us money in the long term by being
 
04:31:28.370 --> 04:31:28.380 align:start position:0%

04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
HB 498 page four in the calendar reads
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
and I quote the bill would have required
 
04:41:03.890 --> 04:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
conservation officers to obtain a search
 
04:41:05.330 --> 04:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
warrant for conducting any search
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
regarding their official duties that's
 
04:41:10.610 --> 04:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
what the bill does in a nutshell
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read from part
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
from part first Article 19 of our
 
04:41:15.718 --> 04:41:17.448 align:start position:0%
from part first Article 19 of our
constitution

04:41:17.448 --> 04:41:17.458 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
the agreement the citizens have with the
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
members of this state every subject has
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
a has a right to be secure from all
 
04:41:26.570 --> 04:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
unreasonable searches and seizures
 
04:41:30.050 --> 04:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
in his person his houses his papers and
 
04:41:31.970 --> 04:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
his possessions
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment to the constant U.S
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution right a document that we
 
04:41:37.730 --> 04:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
would not have signed had the Bill of
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
Rights not been included
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
the right of the people to be secure in
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
their persons houses papers and effects
 
04:41:45.230 --> 04:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
against unreasonable searches and
 
04:41:45.240 --> 04:41:47.390 align:start position:0%
against unreasonable searches and
seizures

04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
seizures
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
what we have before us is a is a law
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
that was put in place in 1935 that's
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
been allowed to continue
 
04:41:56.810 --> 04:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:41:59.090 --> 04:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
sorry the Constitution doesn't say with
 
04:42:00.890 --> 04:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
the exception of Fish and Game officers
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
every right every citizen has a right to
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
be secure from unreasonable searches it
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
in 1935 they put in in law under RSA 206
 
04:42:18.830 --> 04:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
26 certain powers for fish and game
 
04:42:22.128 --> 04:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
to enforce all laws regulations rules
 
04:42:24.650 --> 04:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
relating to Wildlife that's part of
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
their job that's reasonable
 
04:42:28.490 --> 04:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
but further down on that same page it
 
04:42:30.650 --> 04:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
says to stop stop and search without a
 
04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
warrant and to examine in the field in
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
the highway and I'll get back to that
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
and in an air base or on the stream in
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
person or any boat conveyance aircraft
 
04:42:40.260 --> 04:42:41.390 align:start position:0%
person or any boat conveyance aircraft
Etc

04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:42:44.090 --> 04:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
highway it's an interesting part of this
 
04:42:47.208 --> 04:42:47.218 align:start position:0%
because just a few years ago we test
 
04:42:49.010 --> 04:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
that same group
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
with enforcing all of the DMV laws
 
04:42:54.770 --> 04:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game officers what do you
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
believe have more Authority than state
 
04:42:56.400 --> 04:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
believe have more Authority than state
troopers

04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
they have more Authority than sheriffs
 
04:43:03.890 --> 04:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
they have more Authority than local law
 
04:43:06.050 --> 04:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers
 
04:43:08.930 --> 04:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
imagine for a moment someone has parked
 
04:43:11.570 --> 04:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
their car over by Lake Massabesic
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
they're just sitting there having a
 
04:43:13.080 --> 04:43:15.830 align:start position:0%
they're just sitting there having a
conversation

04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.288 --> 04:43:18.298 align:start position:0%
whether it's a State Trooper or or a
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester police officer sees the car
 
04:43:23.448 --> 04:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
and wants to stop and talk to him
 
04:43:25.368 --> 04:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
they're prohibited from going any
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
further they can't just arbitrarily say
 
04:43:29.330 --> 04:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
I need to see inside your trunk but you
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
know what they can call the Fish and
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
Game officer who's monitoring the
 
04:43:35.930 --> 04:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
fishing on that Lake and say hey I need
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
to look inside that guy's car
 
04:43:39.890 --> 04:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
and the citizen doesn't have a right to
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
stop it
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
the Constitution put in very clear terms
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
that you need probable cause to go get a
 
04:43:48.600 --> 04:43:50.448 align:start position:0%
that you need probable cause to go get a
warrant

04:43:50.448 --> 04:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
04:43:52.730 --> 04:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
the officers that oppose this from
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
student name said we can't do this we're
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the field and I have a great story to
 
04:43:57.000 --> 04:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
in the field and I have a great story to
that

04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:02.110 --> 04:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
my daughter and I for her 16th birthday
 
04:44:05.090 --> 04:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
Ridge it's a long hike for those who
 
04:44:07.970 --> 04:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
have done it it's a beautiful hike
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
it was a Friday it was 40 degrees at the
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
base and it was I don't know 10 degrees
 
04:44:14.810 --> 04:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
with the 25 mile an hour wind at the top
 
04:44:17.570 --> 04:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
it was a cold day
 
04:44:20.448 --> 04:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
my iPhone battery died that day halfway
 
04:44:22.970 --> 04:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
up the hill
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's coming down the hill my eye watch
 
04:44:26.990 --> 04:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
went off I actually had a call from work
 
04:44:29.090 --> 04:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
that I took in the midst of the woods
 
04:44:30.770 --> 04:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
coming down the hill
 
04:44:32.570 --> 04:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
with an eye watch
 
04:44:34.850 --> 04:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
why does it matter with the technology
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
that exists today you can get a warrant
 
04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
anywhere any place in New Hampshire
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
without a problem on a cell phone with
 
04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
an email
 
04:44:46.368 --> 04:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
my point there is if a why I watch can
 
04:44:48.530 --> 04:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
transmit that level of information so
 
04:44:51.230 --> 04:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
can a cell phone it is time to restore
 
04:44:53.330 --> 04:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
back to the citizens the rights that are
 
04:44:53.340 --> 04:44:55.010 align:start position:0%
back to the citizens the rights that are
duly

04:44:55.010 --> 04:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
duly
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
provided to us in the Constitution by
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
following the Constitution I would ask
 
04:45:02.208 --> 04:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
that you would oppose the itl I would
 
04:45:03.770 --> 04:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
like to send this back to the committee
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
that is the proper way to address this
 
04:45:08.208 --> 04:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
bill but we'd have to get through an itl
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
motion first there is an amendment to
 
04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
draft narrowly this to enforcement of
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
the DMV laws because the last section of
 
04:45:18.170 --> 04:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
that chapter about enforcement of the
 
04:45:22.368 --> 04:45:22.378 align:start position:0%
dnv laws is where the issue is thank you
 
04:45:25.490 --> 04:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
I request a roll call vote
 
04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker this was a
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
difficult bill for me I agree on
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly on the question of
 
04:45:42.170 --> 04:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights against search and
 
04:45:42.180 --> 04:45:43.310 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights against search and
seizure

04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
seizure
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
having said that it's not correct
 
04:45:50.570 --> 04:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
we granted them the power to enforce
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle Laws because when they're
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
traveling to and fro across our states
 
04:45:58.010 --> 04:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
in a marked police vehicle if they see
 
04:46:00.590 --> 04:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
someone swerving over the lines prior to
 
04:46:02.448 --> 04:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
giving that power they couldn't stop the
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
vehicle now they can stop the vehicle it
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
says they shall have the same powers and
 
04:46:11.810 --> 04:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
duties as regular police officers
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
when they're enforcing Motor Vehicle
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
Laws regular police officers do not have
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
the power to just search a vehicle for
 
04:46:20.750 --> 04:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
no reason
 
04:46:22.490 --> 04:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
they have to get a warrant or they have
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
to have probable cause and there are
 
04:46:26.090 --> 04:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
several exceptions to the warrant
 
04:46:28.010 --> 04:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm not going to bore you
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
with all the legalese but there are
 
04:46:31.850 --> 04:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
exceptions from the Supreme Court that
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
allow searches without a warrant one of
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
them being exigent circumstances
 
04:46:41.208 --> 04:46:41.218 align:start position:0%
with regard to their powers it says it
 
04:46:43.730 --> 04:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
they can't search for no reason the law
 
04:46:45.770 --> 04:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
clearly says that they have to have a
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
clear and articulable reason to search
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
someone's fishing tackle or their boat
 
04:46:53.810 --> 04:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
now the day of this hearing I want you
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
to know I came in and the room was
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
packed packed
 
04:47:01.970 --> 04:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
with fishermen and Hunters
 
04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
every one of them was there to oppose
 
04:47:06.170 --> 04:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
this bill everyone said leave them alone
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing their job they're
 
04:47:10.730 --> 04:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
protecting us they said our lobster
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
traps cost hundreds of dollars if they
 
04:47:14.330 --> 04:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
were not out there doing the job we
 
04:47:15.650 --> 04:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
could lose them
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
we'd be out of business they also said
 
04:47:19.970 --> 04:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be held up for hours
 
04:47:23.090 --> 04:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
at a time while Fish and Game tries to
 
04:47:26.030 --> 04:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
get a warrant to go onto their boat they
 
04:47:28.550 --> 04:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
were happy to do it there's a quid pro
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
quo exactly when you sign a thing to get

second that they were abusing the powers
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
we gave them and let's remember we have
 
04:48:02.930 --> 04:48:02.940 align:start position:0%

they can make the person strip it means
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%

H.R 16 is something near and dear to me
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
it would require the IRS to answer three
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.208 --> 04:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
where and where is the word income
 
04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
defined in the Internal Revenue code it
 
04:55:57.650 --> 04:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
is not previous commissioners of the IRS
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
have already admitted that on tape
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
second where in the Internal Revenue
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
code is it written that the average
 
04:56:04.610 --> 04:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
American who does not exercise a federal
 
04:56:07.128 --> 04:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
privilege but simply trades his time for
 
04:56:08.810 --> 04:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
money is liable to pay the federal
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
income tax and lastly why have numerous
 
04:56:12.890 --> 04:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue Service Publications
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%

States Congress
 
04:56:17.628 --> 04:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
among others stated that the income tax
 
04:56:20.208 --> 04:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
is voluntary
 
04:56:22.010 --> 04:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
time is the most precious resource we
 
04:56:22.020 --> 04:56:24.230 align:start position:0%
time is the most precious resource we
have

04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:26.208 --> 04:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
and we can give back to our constituents
 
04:56:28.970 --> 04:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
a huge chunk of time that they pay in
 
04:56:28.980 --> 04:56:30.170 align:start position:0%
a huge chunk of time that they pay in
money

04:56:30.170 --> 04:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:56:32.810 --> 04:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
and also time to fill out these numerous
 
04:56:35.330 --> 04:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
contradictory complicated and useless
 
04:56:35.340 --> 04:56:38.270 align:start position:0%
contradictory complicated and useless
forms

04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.810 --> 04:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
the income tax code is 74 000 pages long
 
04:56:44.208 --> 04:56:44.218 align:start position:0%
no one in here has read it I'm willing
 
04:56:46.730 --> 04:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
to wager that
 
04:56:48.890 --> 04:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
so the question is has anyone in here
 
04:56:50.810 --> 04:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
read it and have they actually
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
into position is an interesting concept
 
04:56:58.368 --> 04:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
that I would just like to talk about and
 
04:56:59.570 --> 04:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
relates to this
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
this is in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's the action of a state whereby its
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
sovereignty is placed between the
 
04:57:07.550 --> 04:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
citizen and the federal government
 
04:57:09.530 --> 04:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
it is our duty to step in the breach
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
between and out of control federal
 
04:57:13.070 --> 04:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
government and the individual citizens
 
04:57:17.410 --> 04:57:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
monstrosity Goliath from Simply
 
04:57:21.650 --> 04:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
trampling all of our rights
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
we can get it I don't want to get into
 
04:57:24.410 --> 04:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
the nuances of why the federal income
 
04:57:25.430 --> 04:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
tax doesn't apply to the average
 
04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
American you guys wouldn't care and it's
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
not worth the time but the simple fact
 
04:57:31.970 --> 04:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
is the IRS is not open to actually
 
04:57:33.410 --> 04:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
discussing this and I think it's
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
necessary for us
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
to bring this question up and to force
 
04:57:39.650 --> 04:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
the issue because the second we do that
 
04:57:41.810 --> 04:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
is the second we release all of those
 
04:57:43.368 --> 04:57:43.378 align:start position:0%
resources that are being wasted because
 
04:57:44.570 --> 04:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
none of the federal income tax money
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
actually goes to us it goes to pay the
 
04:57:47.330 --> 04:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
interest on a national debt to the
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
privately owned Federal Reserve so it's
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
complete waste of time and it's against
 
04:57:52.970 --> 04:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
all of our principles no matter where
 
04:57:58.190 --> 04:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
article 14 legal remedies to be free
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
complete and prompt
 
04:58:03.530 --> 04:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
every subject of this stays entitled to
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%

04:58:13.610 --> 04:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
and without any denial promptly and
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
without delay conformably to the laws
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we're being denied that by the
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
federal government through their
 
04:58:19.440 --> 04:58:20.868 align:start position:0%
federal government through their
agents

04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
agents
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
at the IRS
 
04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
lastly I want to quote
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
old Danny over there Daniel Webster
 
04:58:30.890 --> 04:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
in famous Supreme Court decision
 
04:58:33.410 --> 04:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
McCulloch verse Maryland he wrote he
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
said in unwell he wrote in Unlimited
 
04:58:38.170 --> 04:58:38.180 align:start position:0%
power to tax
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
involves necessarily a power to destroy
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that the federal I
 
04:58:45.650 --> 04:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
don't want to call them politics
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the federal people at this at
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
the top level
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
have endeavored to destroy us slowly and
 
04:58:55.550 --> 04:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
through a corrupt income tax system and
 
04:58:57.230 --> 04:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm simply just asking you for your
 
04:58:59.208 --> 04:58:59.218 align:start position:0%
support to get this question answered
 
04:59:02.330 --> 04:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
and well these questions and lastly
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
in 2021 I brought this issue up at the
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
town meeting in my town and my
 
04:59:08.208 --> 04:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
representative who's here I don't want
 
04:59:09.350 --> 04:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
to point him out
 
04:59:10.970 --> 04:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
he said that this is an issue for
 
04:59:12.770 --> 04:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
Concord and not for this the select
 
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
board or town meeting so here I am I
 
04:59:17.390 --> 04:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
went through all the effort and now I'm
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
here so I appreciate your support and I
 
04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.948 --> 04:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
but does the member yield the questions
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:39.650 --> 04:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you so
 
04:59:41.930 --> 04:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question are you
 
04:59:43.850 --> 04:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
aware that under the Republican
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
president General former General
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
Eisenhower the marginal tax rate in this
 
04:59:52.490 --> 04:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
country was 92 percent
 
04:59:55.128 --> 04:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
I would argue that
 
05:00:02.208 --> 05:00:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
05:00:11.208 --> 05:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsor among other things used the
 
05:00:19.550 --> 05:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
term average American
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
average American was not clear to the
 
05:00:25.250 --> 05:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
committee what constituted an average
 
05:00:25.260 --> 05:00:26.930 align:start position:0%
committee what constituted an average
American

05:00:26.930 --> 05:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
American
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
uh is the committee report stated which
 
05:00:30.890 --> 05:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
you should all have access to this
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
proposed resolution sought to make the
 
05:00:34.850 --> 05:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
case the sponsor just sought to make the
 
05:00:37.368 --> 05:00:37.378 align:start position:0%
case that certain IRS
 
05:00:40.010 --> 05:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue practices are extra
 
05:00:40.020 --> 05:00:41.390 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue practices are extra
legal

05:00:41.390 --> 05:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
legal
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
but that flies in the face of the
 
05:00:46.730 --> 05:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution the 16th Amendment to the
 
05:00:46.740 --> 05:00:48.350 align:start position:0%
Constitution the 16th Amendment to the
Constitution

05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
like it or not it clearly sanctions a
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
federal income tax as well as numerous
 
05:00:53.638 --> 05:00:54.708 align:start position:0%
federal income tax as well as numerous
other

05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:00:57.890 --> 05:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
subsequent codes and statutes and
 
05:01:02.930 --> 05:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
levied at the uh at different levels so
 
05:01:08.330 --> 05:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
the committee voted 16-1 to recommend
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%

05:02:28.670 --> 05:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
if I knew that the Federal Government
 
05:02:31.368 --> 05:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
utilizes special definitions otherwise
 
05:02:33.170 --> 05:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
known as terms of art within the
 
05:02:35.570 --> 05:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code to obfuscate what
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
such as the term wages being defined as

for purposes of this chapter the term
 
05:02:45.050 --> 05:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
wages means all remuneration other than
 
05:02:46.490 --> 05:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
fees paid to a public official for

05:02:58.250 --> 05:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry if I knew that the
 
05:03:01.150 --> 05:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
term employee is defined as for
 
05:03:03.288 --> 05:03:03.298 align:start position:0%

an agency exceptionally it goes on has
 
05:03:13.970 --> 05:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with us then I if I was to
 
05:03:13.980 --> 05:03:14.810 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with us then I if I was to

district and asked people and this was
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
one of the three planks I would vote
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
