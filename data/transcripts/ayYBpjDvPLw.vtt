00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 align:start position:0%
bubbling gotcha so what I'm more
 
00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 align:start position:0%
concerned about is our enforcement now
 
00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
many years several years ago we just
 
00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
chose to make tobacco
 
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
enforced by The Liquor Commission along
 
00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
with because the liquid commission was
 
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
already going into these convenience
 
00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
stores and regulating the sale of the
 
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
products at that spot so that
 
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
theoretically my concern is that so are
 
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
we passing this theoretically now is our
 
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 align:start position:0%
is our Liquor Commission enforcement
 
00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
in terms of enforcing the current
 
00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 align:start position:0%
statute related to tobacco
 
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
and smoking products because I know we
 
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
put piping and we put those little
 
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
vaping stuffs in with that statue that's
 
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
all together are they going to be
 
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
enforcing this new section
 
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that
 
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
specifically requires them to enforce
 
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
this we have had conversations with the
 
00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I don't know if
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
they're here
 
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
um it would be helpful if they if they
 
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
were here to answer those questions
 
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
um but my understanding is that to the
 
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
extent that they have access to licensed
 
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 align:start position:0%
facilities for tobacco uh and liquor
 
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
with this prohibition they could also uh
 
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.090 align:start position:0%
with this prohibition they could also uh
enforce

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
um the law after this I guess would it
 
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
be the 439a is that in there is that
 
00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
picked up by the reinforcement division
 
00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.630 align:start position:0%
picked up by the reinforcement division
now

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
439a the hemp law sits under the
 
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture uh uh grants
 
00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
of statutory Authority again my
 
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
understanding is the filter commission
 
00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 align:start position:0%
has brought authority to uh enforce
 
00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
state law generally and so this
 
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition or this Clarity that these
 
00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
products were never intended to be
 
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
illegal would be caught up by liquor
 
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
commissions General Authority uh to
 
00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 align:start position:0%
enforce state law in a general way okay
 
00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.149 align:start position:0%
enforce state law in a general way okay
okay

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
any other questions to the committee yes
 
00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan thank you um
 
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan thank you um
just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
you you said you're not sure if they are
 
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
actually iding people who are buying it
 
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
are they supposed to like is the law on
 
00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
the books now that you have to be 21 to
 
00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
buy this or is it no so there's no law
 
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
on the books for a 10 year old to walk
 
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
in and buy it if they felt like it yes
 
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 align:start position:0%
this legislation saying prohibiting it
 
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
this would prohibit the sale to anybody
 
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
so what do you mean an ID involved this
 
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting that sale of these
 
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
products to anybody period that is
 
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you my question has to do with
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
clarifying the wording there's some
 
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
wording in here that I'm not clear on
 
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
for instance it says that
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
THC greater than 0.03 percent
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe you're not the right person
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
for me to ask this but the law talks
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
about 0.3 percent that hemp is defined
 
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
as a variety of cannabis that's point
 
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
three percent so it's 0.03 percent a
 
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
mistake the second thing is that Delta 9
 
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
THC comes from can be developed from a
 
00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 align:start position:0%
cannabis variety but cannot be developed
 
00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
from a hemp variety that meets the 0.3
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
percent so there's there's terminology
 
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 align:start position:0%
in here that's conflicting and I'm
 
00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 align:start position:0%
getting very confused uh sure again uh
 
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Simon behind me will be able to
 
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
provide more detail however 0.03 is the
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
correct amount of legal THC in
 
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
industrial hemp products and secondly
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
um from those plans from industrial hemp
 
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
legal Industrial Hemp plants
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
which are legal because that they have a
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
THC level of under 0.03 percent
 
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
they can extract
 
00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 align:start position:0%
CBD can be extracted from those legal
 
00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
Industrial Hemp plants that are under
 
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
the THC level and the CBD then the
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
chemical that is extracted can be
 
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
converted chemically synthetically back
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
into Delta 9 THC which is the active
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
ingredient in cannabis it can also be
 
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
synthesized into Delta 8 THC it can also
 
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
be synthesized into many other THC
 
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids that appear in cannabis
 
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
plants in small doses and novel
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids that do not appear in
 
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
I must say I treated that that 0.03
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
percent is like our non-alcohol beer it
 
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
says on it has to be less than 0.05
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
percent so there was some saying some
 
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
some products just have can't help it
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
have something in it some grain of it
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
but it has to be this de minimis number
 
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
to say it's got to be less than that so
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's a very reduced form of hemp exactly
 
00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
I see okay yeah representing Gibson uh
 
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
just so unclear uh I've seen on on store
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
counters products labeled CBD and
 
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
product label THC I honestly
 
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
don't know that much about what they do
 
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
and I have actually never purchased any
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
um uh but my question is this statute
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
would completely prohibit the sale of
 
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
the THC products but would allow the CBD
 
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
products is that correct
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
that is correct CBD products gen are the
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
general difference between CBD and THC
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
is that CBD is non-intoxicating
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
THC is the product in t in in cannabis
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
that is intoxicating so yes you're right
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
this bill would do nothing with regard
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
to Legal CBD the federal government has
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
legalized CBD as a as a as a as a
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
product but not THC thank you
 
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative Ammon thank you Mr
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking our questions
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
um so we're talking about this 0.03
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
percent what percentage THC are being
 
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
sold in products around the state do we
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
know uh has there been any analysis done
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh we can only go by their labels
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh I believe Mr Simon has passed out
 
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
um emailed the committee um there's an
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
image here of a label that was purchased
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
in in uh New Hampshire and 92 THC
 
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.370 align:start position:0%
in in uh New Hampshire and 92 THC
um

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
10 milligrams of thcp
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh so we're talking about labeling which
 
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.550 align:start position:0%
uh so we're talking about labeling which
is

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
astronomically higher than the 0.03
 
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.770 align:start position:0%
astronomically higher than the 0.03
percent

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Waltz
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
can you tell us exactly what are these
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
products that don't have like an age
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
minimum I mean is it are they edible
 
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
products is it uh like yeah you want to
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
these products they have they're a range
 
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
of products including uh Vape cartridges
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
um okay so for Vape as a question was
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
already yeah so Edibles uh cartridges
 
00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:25.819 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps others tinctures
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
any form that they can sell it they will
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
right but isn't there a age like they're
 
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
offer cigarettes isn't there an age
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's the problem there's no regulation
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
that's what we're about to pass here and
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
what we're going to pass is something
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
you will like we're Banning it all
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
together we're not even talking about
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
age here we're Banning it all together
 
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.210 align:start position:0%
age here we're Banning it all together
nice

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:46.220 align:start position:0%
nice
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman you're
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:07:59.689 align:start position:0%
 
enforce

00:07:59.689 --> 00:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
enforce so these
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
these laws prohibiting the sale
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
look very good or right
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
sound reasonable but it's always the
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I think we said it was
 
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission but we certainly
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
can take it up and subcommittee but I
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
think we might want to make a reference
 
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the Liquor Commission
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
and they're looking forward and then how
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
would they do that and what they do it
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
now right now when they come in and they
 
00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:27.419 align:start position:0%
expect what's on the shelves yeah
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
but more importantly obviously they're
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about the sales and
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
who's you know whether you're old enough
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
and qualified to buy the cigarettes
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
with the way that the statue was today
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
but in this case that yeah they would be
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
looking on the shelf and and and telling
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
the uh vendor to remove something remove
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
a product so uh appropriate uh
 
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:52.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement would be critical to this
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you don't want to
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
pass something that's not enforced to to
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
declare if I may to clarify my testimony
 
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
was not that the Liquor Commission was
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
on board my testimony was at the Liquor
 
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
Commission is aware of this bill
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
we wish they were here right okay
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
so you know it was not asked for a
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
question yet
 
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:16.940 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so my understanding that a lot
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
of these products are on the shelves and
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
gas stations etc etc
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
and I noticed and so those will be
 
00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
and I noticed and so those will be
illegal

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
I noticed that this
 
00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:34.339 align:start position:0%
uh bill would be active after 60 days
 
00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
that tells me that these people would
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
maybe do a fire sale to get rid of all
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
this stuff because they did if they
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
don't they have to throw it away would
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
it make more sense to make this bill be
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
effective immediately so that that
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
Services doesn't have an opinion yes it
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
it might um but the Liquor Commission to
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
the extent that they uh choose to
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
enforce this may need
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
um some time to ramp up you know any any
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
kind of enforcement
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
um 60 days is a standard yeah so this
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
this question comes up often um we
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually have a statute that tells when
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
effective date should be based upon the
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
type of Statute so uh yes there is
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
multiple choices you can be upon passage
 
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
which is the governor signing it so
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's still delayed UH 60 days and then
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
January 1st of the following year and
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
usually is uh based upon giving the
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
person whoever potentially be selling
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
the illegal product to give them time to
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of their inventory
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you know
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
um a legalized cannabis bill has passed
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.889 align:start position:0%
the house
um

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
how would this bill interact with the
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
provisions of that bill assuming of
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
course that that bill passes the Senate
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
and is signed by the governor which I
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
know it is it is far from guaranteed but
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that bill is enacted and this
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill is enacted
 
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:14.420 align:start position:0%
um obviously legalized cannabis contains
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
THC I think that's the whole point
 
00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
um so how would how would these two
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
bills interact
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
House Bill 639 establishes a rigid
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure for cannabis
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
products to be sold including a
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
limitation on on an age restriction so
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
21 plus so we have a regulated product
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
available only to 21 and uh 21 years old
 
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
and older
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
um this would this dovetails with that
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
and that it it removes these products
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
that are not regulated so we don't know
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's in them potentially unsafe and
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
available to minors from the market You
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
could argue that these these products if
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
if legalization happen if wreck was
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
alive and well right now that these
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
products are directly uh competing with
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
products that are produced legally
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and at the at the agreed upon tax
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
rate follow-up question yeah I would say
 
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
if you look at the word statute it's 439
 
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
A4 it says hemp derived products
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
so the difference is that 639 is a
 
00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:21.889 align:start position:0%
so the difference is that 639 is a
cannabis

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
product when this is just directing the
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
hemp uh follow-up question
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire thank
 
00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:32.269 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire thank
you

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
um so this bill would prohibit products
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
not regulated under HB 639 that's
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
um further question uh per well perhaps
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
um uh the hemp derived is is a
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient clarification we might want
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
to add a little more
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
um uh wording clarification to make it
 
00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
clear that the two bills wouldn't
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
interfere with each other yeah well I
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
mean normally what we would have said uh
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
in 639 it was notwithstanding other
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
statutes but obviously the statute
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
didn't exist in the books but
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that that their way this has
 
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
nothing in this chapter
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
it just basically because this is again
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
this is the agricultural the products so
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
it was just saying nothing in this
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
chapter so it really does not conflict
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
with 639 at all because thank you there
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
are different parts of the chapter but
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
now withstanding that we're still
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
thinking we're going to have the same
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement which would be the liquor
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
enforcement division House Bill 639 had
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
a number of amendments as you know
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
um my belief my memory says that the
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis in 639 excludes
 
00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.210 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis in 639 excludes
hemp

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:46.220 align:start position:0%
hemp
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
so we can check that to make sure but I
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
believe 639 has an exclusion that
 
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's being regulated by 639
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
does not include I guess I get the head
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay perfect oh representative Walsh has
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
so I understand the cannabis versus this
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
this still says cannabis in here
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
so this bill is still talking about
 
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
uh use of cannabis
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic purposes
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
so should everywhere where it says
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis should it be changed to hemp uh
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
no section one of this bill
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
um is a different RSA entirely as 126 x
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
12 with with uh with regard to the
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis law under the
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
section two is under the hemp bill in
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
section two RSA 439a has a definition of
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
hemp that you're not seeing in this uh
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay section one is only for the atcs
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
which yes that is cannabis section two
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
is a wholly different section it was a
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
not somewhat germane amendment when they
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
the Senate added on there which is
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
probably unusual for them to find
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
anything tremendous but uh so but anyway
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
yeah there are two separate sections two
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
different Services representative Yemen
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just one other
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand where where and
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
how this problem was created so it was
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
the 2018 farm bill that the U.S Congress
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
passed that created this issue is that
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct again
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon's going to do some very
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
thorough cleanup behind me um on on the
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
history of the hemp bill um but yes the
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
federal 2018 hemp bill or Farm Bill
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
legalized industrial hemp and over the
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
past five years uh technology has been
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh discovered utilized that would allow
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
CBD derived from illegal Industrial Hemp
 
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
federally illegal and state legal
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
Industrial Hemp to be converted into THC
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
products okay and for the question
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh I'd be curious is there
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
any effort at the federal level to solve
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
the problem that they created and what
 
00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:04.459 align:start position:0%
are they doing about it
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
yes yes and no uh it's not it's
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
insufficient um but the feds have done
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh have made certain announcements
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
regarding certain hemp derived products
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
um my again my belief is that they have
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
they have stated that
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
THC products that do not appear in any
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
way in a cannabis plant
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
are still controlled substances and yet
 
00:16:29.769 --> 00:16:29.779 align:start position:0%
they have not gone so far as to say
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
Delta nine Delta a and other THC
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
um uh cannabinoids that are in cannabis
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
are unlawful uh they're working on it
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
let alone we know that Federal
 
00:16:44.689 --> 00:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
government's not the great when it comes
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
to enforcement of some of the statutes
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
so on the state level okay thank you
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
okay Matt Simon from primeatc who
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman honorable
 
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.070 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman honorable
committee

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
I bet you thought you were done with
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis policy for the session sorry to
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
disappoint you yeah we have no
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
disillusion that this is just the
 
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.310 align:start position:0%
disillusion that this is just the
beginning

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
well this bill is much shorter than HP
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
639 so I'm
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
confident that we can deal with it in
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
one day but unfortunately as you've
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
already gotten to taste the the subject
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
itself is rather
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
complicated so
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'll bet some of you are not aware until
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
this morning that these hemp derived THC
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
products exist
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
now you know so I'll back up and explain
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
just a little bit so for many years one
 
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
of the harms associated with cannabis
 
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
prohibition is that it created a market
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
for Dangerous Alternatives people
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
couldn't go to a store and buy a regular
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
Botanical Delta 9 cannabis so they would
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
seek out various Alternatives about a
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
decade ago we had a study Commission in
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dealing with products
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
called K2 and spice which were called
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes synthetic marijuana but really
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
they were just different types of plant
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
matter that were sprayed with different
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
chemicals that were designed to resemble
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids but weren't really nobody
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
really knew what they were they produced
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
a high something like cannabis and
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
therefore were popular and also very
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
problematic because they're more harmful
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
than cannabis and we don't know what
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
they are so we got our we wrapped our
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
policy heads around that we prohibited
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
those products and Flash Forward to 2018
 
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
when Congress passed the the hemp
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as part of the farm bill at
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
the time nobody or maybe a very tiny
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
number of people knew that it was
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
chemically possible to grow fields of
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
hemp harvest the CBD cannabidiol and
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
then use chemicals to convert all of
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
that CBD into
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
basically any variant of THC you might
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
want you can convert it into Delta 9 THC
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
which is the same molecule that's
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
available in cannabis or you can convert
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
it into one of these other varieties of
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
THC that I'd never heard of until a few
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
years ago so Delta 8 THC is the one that
 
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.169 align:start position:0%
years ago so Delta 8 THC is the one that
became

00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
became
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
a really popular thing first I happen to
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
be in Texas in in February of 2021 when
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
this broke in the Washington Post
 
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
there's this big story about Delta 8
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
products hemp derived THC and you can
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
get it anywhere and Texas was Ground
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
Zero for that so I went straight to the
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
nearest vape shop I bought a Delta 8
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
Vape cartridge
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
look a little something like this and I
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
I took it to the nearest disc golf
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
course I inhaled twice I went to The
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
First Tee and by the time I was on the
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
First Tee I realized that wow Congress
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
has legalized THC sales inadvertently
 
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
through the hemp law and this is going
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
to be a policy complication of epic
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
proportions for states to deal with
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
um so since then these these products
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
have proliferated
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
um they're available in edible form
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
they're available sometimes you'll see
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
hemp flowers uh look just like canvas
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
flower but it's hemp flower and they'll
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
be sprayed down with these cannabinoids
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
to to give the effect that resembles
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis so
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
um ten years ago I called spice and K2
 
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
the bathtub gin of cannabis prohibition
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
I I said we need to
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
make regular cannabis available because
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
people will always want these
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
substitutes now fortunately not that
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
many people are using K2 and spice
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's still available but it's
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
primarily people are trying to evade a
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
drug test since those aren't real
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids they usually won't show up
 
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
on a drug test and these products mostly
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
will show up on a drug test but they're
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
very popular because they're very
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
available they are as we've heard
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
available at gas stations vape shops
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
mail order uh they're they're really
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
quite available until really recently
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
that was just Delta nine I'm sorry Delta
 
00:21:35.409 --> 00:21:35.419 align:start position:0%
Delta eight and and Delta 10 which are
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat less intoxicating than Delta 9
 
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.390 align:start position:0%
somewhat less intoxicating than Delta 9
THC

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
THC
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
so in recent months I've become very
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
alarmed to see new THC variants that
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of and again I've been
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
I've been consuming Delta 9 THC for over
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
25 years pretty regularly I it's it's a
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
substance that's well understood that
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
humans have thousands of years of
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
experience with
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
thco acetate
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
I'd never heard of that until pretty
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
recently it's several times more potent
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
than Delta 9 THC and there are then I
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
started getting emails about products
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
called THC H THC JD thcp
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
the last three I mentioned are all
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be at least 25 times more
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
potent than Delta 9 THC
 
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.789 align:start position:0%
potent than Delta 9 THC
so

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit alarmed okay I'm
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
actually pretty alarmed that these
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
products are widely available and even
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
if I didn't care about people having bad
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
experiences with these products I think
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
they reflect very badly on the regulated
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
systems that we're trying to create
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
around actual cannabis
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
so every time a teenager uses one of
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
these products that's a statistic the
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
same as if they used Delta 9 THC if they
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
get caught at school vaping this and in
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
the bathroom that gets blamed on legal
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
regulated cannabis not on a loophole in
 
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
the hemp law it this is this was
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
purchased right down the street by one
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues that has thcp in it and
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
if some you know if some kid Vapes that
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and has a mental health problem or
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
something like that resulting that will
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
be blamed on legal regulated cannabis
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
not on a loophole in the hemp law
 
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
so this bill began as a bill that was I
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
think hostile to the atcs it was solely
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
attempting to impose strict labeling
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
requirements on the atcs these are the
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
products we sell they're already very
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
heavily regulated they have to be an
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
opaque child resistant packaging the all
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
the cannabinoids have to be displayed on
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
the label all the terpenes have to be
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
displayed on the label there's
 
00:23:53.049 --> 00:23:53.059 align:start position:0%
independent batch specific lab testing
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
boring Packaging
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
this was this bill began as a solution
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
in search of a problem and unlike most
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
bills that begin that way it actually
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
found its problem when the Senate
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee learned that there
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
widespread availability of THC products
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
that they had not authorized that they
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
certainly did not intend to authorize in
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
2019 when they passed the hemp law
 
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
they amended this bill to clarify
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
the hemp law so I I would suggest that
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's completely not only consistent but
 
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:28.460 align:start position:0%
essential to the goals of HB 639
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
not that these products be banned but if
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to be sold they need to be
 
00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
sold within the same regulated system
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
that other THC products are sold under
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
and they need to be independently lab
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
tested in a bad specific way and they
 
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
need to be subject to all the same
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
packaging requirements and the same
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
gotta show an ID and the same everything
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh to do otherwise is irresponsible
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
policy and puts the goals of HB 639 very
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
much at risk in in my opinion so
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
it's actually been organizations like
 
00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
normal I passed out normal's guide to
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
Delta THC and other novel cannabinoids
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
normal's been advocating for legal
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis and and claiming you know the
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
the lobby that represents canvas
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
consumers uh in their words and they're
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
they're leading the charge along with
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis journalists at Leafly and other
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
other outlets it was Leafly that first
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
shown the light on The Vaping crisis a
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
few years ago when people were becoming
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
were developing lung injuries from
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
unregulated THC Vapes it was Leafly that
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
that figured out what that actually was
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
it was an additive called vitamin E
 
00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.990 align:start position:0%
it was an additive called vitamin E
acetate

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
acetate
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
that was killing people and another
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
great reason to have regulated supply
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
chain for cannabis so it's at this point
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's begun to be Leafly in normal joined
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
by public health organizations I'm
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
pleased that new Futures is behind me we
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
often disagree but we agree on this one
 
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.250 align:start position:0%
often disagree but we agree on this one
again

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
if people want to try these novel THC
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
variants I'm all for letting them do
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
that but they need to know what they're
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
doing they need to know what these
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
products are and they should not assume
 
00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:16.789 align:start position:0%
products are and they should not assume
that

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
see this on a shelf it looks like a
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
regulated product it must be legal can't
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
be bad for me and there's a sense that
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
well it's made from Cannabis or it's
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
made from hemp therefore it's safe well
 
00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
cannabis itself has a well-established
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
safety profile but squeezing oils out of
 
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
it and the big risk is in the chemical
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
conversion process because when you're
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
converting CBD to any of these THC
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
variants you're using chemicals to do it
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
you're weaving residuals and if you do
 
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
not scrub that product very thoroughly
 
00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:49.340 align:start position:0%
when you're done
 
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
it could have anything in it and it's it
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
should be a cause of concern so
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
I will I one last thing and then I'll go
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
to questions uh I just noticed that the
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
decimal is in the wrong place it should
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
be 0.3 not 0.03 so good catch
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative and that is something
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
this committee should fix to be
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal and state hemp
 
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.909 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal and state hemp
law

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Herbert is the
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
first hand I saw
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
um my question actually is uh a policy
 
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.970 align:start position:0%
um my question actually is uh a policy
one

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
what is the policy that we're being
 
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
asked to speak to the microphone what is
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
the policy the policy is is to ban these
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
products in New Hampshire okay so that
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to be voting we're
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
you're voting on Banning hemp derived
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
products containing THC
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
I would suggest yes that's correct but
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's a little more specific than
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
that I think it's a clarification that
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
the hemp law does not authorize the sale
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
of these products
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
these products could conceivably be sold
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
through the regulated system established
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
by HB 639 that's another section of law
 
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
there was a paragraph in there directing
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
the commission to study hemp derived THC
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
and and whether it should be sold I
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's still in the bill
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
or not but that's something they're
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
supposed to look at and study but it's
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
the hemp law that shouldn't be
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
authorizing these products it wasn't
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
intended to do so and if they're going
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
to be sold they should be sold through
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
the system under 639. for the question
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
you may inquire
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
um are we here in the committee supposed
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
to write this law or are we just doing a
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
policy the law the law is written that's
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
what the bill is that's the bill the
 
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill is the law and we're and
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes or no yes yes well I'm hearing that
 
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.149 align:start position:0%
yes or no yes yes well I'm hearing that
uh

00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations this gentleman has made
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
he's talking about in 639 the bill that
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
we did pass already
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
there is a study committee in there
 
00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:06.620 align:start position:0%
to look into what to do with these uh
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
hemp products and whether we should
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
allow them or not and assuming that if
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
we were to allow them that they would be
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
licensed and controlled and regulated
 
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
just like we did with marijuana in hb639
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I have two questions
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
um the first is will this bill cover all
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
I believe it does so the language
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
includes the line which appear in any
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
formulation including Delta eight THC
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 THC or any other THC isomer
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
variant so I'm not a chemist but my
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that language
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
covers if next week There's a THC XYZ
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
that this would that that would be a THC
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
isomer variant and it would already be
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
covered follow-up please father for the
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
question you inquire my other question
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
is this this picture that you put for us
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's it's for people that aren't looking
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
at it it says ghost train Haze Cloud
 
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.870 align:start position:0%
at it it says ghost train Haze Cloud
eight

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
um mind bending kids are I mean this is
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing kids are gonna either
 
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
put in their pockets or ask a friend to
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
buy for them is is and I don't know
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
whether it was legislation that put
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
cigarettes behind the counter in locked
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
up but it seems to me these type of
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
products need to be there as well
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't believe there's any
 
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
regulation at all so we have seen these
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
products sitting directly on on the just
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
on the Shelf where somebody a kid could
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
could reach them and I'll add the back
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
of that package has has some adjectives
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh hazy euphoric
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
one of them is Swifty
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
does anybody know what Swifty is that's
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
a cartoon reference Rick and Morty uh
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
get schwifty on Rick and Morty so
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
um it's not something that we use in our
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
educational materials at the ATC I can
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
assure you
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative bulliam
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:15.860 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
does anybody know who is making these
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
products absolutely uh our CEO gets
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
emails all the time from these companies
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
trying to sell us kilos of
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
THC this and THC that we obviously have
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
to produce everything in-house for for
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program but
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
they they try to convince us they're 100
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
Federal illegal and you can buy them for
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
pennies on the dollar and it's pretty
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
alarming to us uh but it's largely hemp
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
companies in places like Texas and
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
Florida and some other states that have
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
really developed hemp Industries part of
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's caused by the FDA abdicating its
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility to regulate CBD products
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
they've grown all this CBD there there's
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
demand for CBD products but there's also
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
demand for this stuff and if you can
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
make more converting it they're they're
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
doing what makes sense to them
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
economically until somebody tells them
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
it depends on who you ask
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it illegal
 
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it illegal
representative

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
question for you based on the uh
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
testimony we've just heard with respect
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
to 0.03 so uh and then a question for Mr
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
Simon 0.03
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
this is what was passed by the Senate so
 
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to clean this up
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill will need some Amendment yes
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
this will go to a subcommittee this
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
afternoon right so assuming that we
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
change this to 0.3 which we will then we
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
pass this and it's got to go back to the
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
Senate they will have to concur this is
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
not just the typographical error they
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
actually passed this at 0.03 yeah that
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the question for you sir is
 
00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:02.930 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the question for you sir is
um

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:06.020 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me about 0.03 why not
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
0.02 or 0.00 or 0.04 what's the science
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
on this and why was Zero as we now know
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
Wise was 0.3 selected
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I don't
 
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
know but that was the policy decision
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
made by Congress when it passed the
 
00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
federal hemp legislation and that was
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
the policy decision made by New
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature when it passed New
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's hemp legislation so it is
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
0.3 and that's generally accepted to be
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
the the standard for for hemp
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
so Paul so presumably there's some
 
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.269 align:start position:0%
so Paul so presumably there's some
science

00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:33:47.649 --> 00:33:47.659 align:start position:0%
to the effect that less than 0.3
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
is not a problem but point three is is
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
some kind of a threshold where anything
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
at point three or above is deemed to be
 
00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.769 align:start position:0%
at point three or above is deemed to be
dangerous

00:33:59.769 --> 00:33:59.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
this is just like that we with beer
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
right now with beer
 
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
that you know that it was point it's 0.5
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
is considered and basically the the
 
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
issue was always is that some products
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
just have it naturally like beer you
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
know some things you can't
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
you can't truly get it all the alcohol
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
out it has something so they set it to
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
Minimus it's a federal number so we're
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
not Reinventing any wheel here we're
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
taking a number that the feds had
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
already had already analyzed it and
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
decided that the THC as long as it has
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
we still don't know the answer to the
 
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
question but we're adopting the federal
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
0.3 correct we don't but we you can't
 
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
answer my question nobody knows thanks
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
and this may thank you and this may be a
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
clarification that I'm asking for
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
So based on everything that I've heard
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
it sounds like even though you define
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
something as hemp and it's 0.3 THC uh
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 I think is what they defining it
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
as that variety not any other variety
 
00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:14.579 align:start position:0%
that variety correct you can chemically
 
00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
that variety correct you can chemically
alter

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
alter
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
0.3 THC hemp
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
THD Delta 9 temp into a whole bunch of
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
other things that can in fact end up
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
being much worse
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
than the delta 9.
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's correct what's in typically in
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
cannabis yeah and to clarify it's not
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the small amount of th Delta 9 THC
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's being converted in most cases
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's the very large amount of CBD hemp
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
plants produce large amounts of
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
non-psychoactive CBD and that's what's
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
being chemically converted there are two
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
Federal there are two arguments that
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
these companies make when they say these
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
products are federally legal one is that
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
anything made from hemp is a legal hemp
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
product a natural hemp product as long
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
as it does not contain more than 0.3
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
percent THC so one of the loopholes is
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
actually to make edibles
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
that are very bulky and they're bulky
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
enough to comply with that so it's point
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
three percent but it's like imagine a
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
loaf of bread that's 0.3 percent THC
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
that would have enough THC to get some
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
somebody plenty intoxicated so that's
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
one of the legal theories we're seeing
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
bulky Edibles that actually do contain
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 sold and they're claiming it's
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
Fairly Legal the other is that
 
00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:35.099 align:start position:0%
it hinges on whether these products are
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
synthetic or natural
 
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
so there's a federal analogs act
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
that says synthetic drugs are illegal
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion these are all
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
synthetics because they're being
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
synthesized you're taking CBD you're
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
adding chemicals you're making a new
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
compound that barely exists in nature
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
and to me that's very plainly a
 
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.329 align:start position:0%
and to me that's very plainly a
synthetic

00:36:58.329 --> 00:36:58.339 align:start position:0%
synthetic
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
but the DEA somehow has taken the
 
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
position that if it occurs in nature in
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
any amount which Delta 8 does in Trace
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
Amounts then well you know it's it's
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's a natural product because it's
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
made from hemp and if you're trying to
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
sow chaos like do what the DEA has done
 
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
they did say that thco acetate is a
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
synthetic because it doesn't appear in
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
nature so that one THC isomer variant
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
DEA is helpfully clear a lot clarified
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
as federally illegal there are other
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that don't share that
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
view and that do consider these products
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
to be federally illegal based on the
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
federal analogs act
 
00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
there are not really a lot of court
 
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
cases uh on this that would help us out
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
so states have been left to make policy
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
for themselves and many have seen fit to
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
do what you're looking at doing which is
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
clarifying hemp legislation
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
and and I would state for everyone if
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
the people who are manufacturing this
 
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.609 align:start position:0%
the people who are manufacturing this
product

00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:37:58.619 --> 00:38:00.050 align:start position:0%
product
if

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
they really didn't want us to ban it
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
they would be here today
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay so the fact that we have no
 
00:38:08.569 --> 00:38:08.579 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill take a letter is
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
that this is the right answer at this
 
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
point to ban it and if they're at some
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
point in time that they think that they
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
can come up with a legitimate product
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's safe and that we have a study
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
committee that will be able to listen to
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
that conversation but today we need to
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
get this statute passed
 
00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:30.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I'm just trying to move
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
things along we have other people want
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
to speak and I just it's quick but it's
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to be something new and different
 
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.470 align:start position:0%
going to be something new and different
right

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.550 align:start position:0%
right
somewhat

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
if you prohibit and you ban doesn't that
 
00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.829 align:start position:0%
if you prohibit and you ban doesn't that
mean

00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
nothing zero zilch
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
so to touch upon representative Terry's
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
Point why does this have any percentage
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't answer the question
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not an expert on hemp policy
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
the idea was
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
policymakers wanted to draw a line
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
somewhere and they wanted to draw the
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
line somewhere where plainly you could
 
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
not grow the flower and smoke it and get
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
high and that is true of 0.3 percent THC
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
flour I think they were not thinking
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
about all the things that could then be
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
manufactured and processed from that
 
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.030 align:start position:0%
manufactured and processed from that
flower

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
flower
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
just like right now with beer the
 
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
non-alcohol beer
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay it has to be less than 0.5
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is and when I can
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
pursue that argument this question was
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
that sometimes you just can't get it all
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
out so believe it or not you might be
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
eating a fruit
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
that has alcohol in it less than 0.5
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
alcohol and you don't know that and they
 
00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
haven't tested where they didn't label
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
it because we never require them to
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
label it but that some fruit just
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
naturally fermented and created an
 
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
alcohol that's very low level alcohol
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
you can't get drunk from it just like
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
you can't get stoned from this stuff
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hammond
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Simon
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
I don't usually Preamble my questions
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to do a little bit here
 
00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that these
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
products exist mainly do be due to
 
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
Prohibition right they're they're
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
loopholes around existing laws
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
and now we're talking about another
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
prohibition to solve
 
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:44.579 align:start position:0%
the results of the prior prohibition
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
and I guess we're not asking a question
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
what are the unintended consequences of
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
prohibiting these
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
products that exist because of
 
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
prohibition could they go to the black
 
00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.329 align:start position:0%
prohibition could they go to the black
market

00:40:58.329 --> 00:40:58.339 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
could they you know if our taxes on
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
regulated cannabis go too high
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
could these come in in a Black Market
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
approach to undercut those taxes what
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
are the unintended consequences if you
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
could speculate thank you
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.670 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know the consequences I'm most
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about which
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people who want to
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
consume THC in New Hampshire and in the
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
U.S we know that and they have options
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're options are to go to a regulated
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
retail store in Massachusetts which I
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
think is a good option if you're going
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
to consume cannabis all of their
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
products are independently lab tested
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
they're labeled appropriately
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
and sold in a responsible fashion New
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's therapeutic cannabis program
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
another example well-regulated products
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's where I would want people to go
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
I would not want people to buy
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
unregulated products if I cared about
 
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
their health because they might be just
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
fine or they might be very harmful
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
the independent testing that has been
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
done of these products has found that
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
many of them are just not what they say
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
they are they either contain way more of
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
the Delta eight or whatever THC it is or
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
weigh less some of them contain Delta 9
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
THC without saying they do and a lot of
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
them contain pesticides impurities heavy
 
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
metals that we should all be alarmed by
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
especially in the context of a vape
 
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
cartridge something you're inhaling
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
directly into your lungs so
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
and I can think of no case or I would
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
recommend that a friend of mine go buy
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of these products when they could be
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
buying actual cannabis or actual
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
regulated cannabis products so
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:47.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
we do have more people to testify maybe
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
you can ask that next person your
 
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.390 align:start position:0%
you can ask that next person your
question

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you very much uh Tim Egan
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%

to hear my testimony I'll try to be
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
brief and
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions Matt I look as an expert so um
 
00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
one second sorry my computer's a little
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
slow here
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%

I'm a former representative from Sugar
 
00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:46.130 align:start position:0%
I'm a former representative from Sugar
Hill

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
Hill
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
um and currently a member of the New
 
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Canada trade Council as well
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
today I am here as the chair of New
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis Association the
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
state's leading trade group for the
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry and proponents of safe
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
use of regulated cannabis and I
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
bring that to bear in this bill
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 180 that we are proponents
 
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
of regulated cannabis use and this is
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
why this bill is an issue and that we
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
are here to support it
 
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
um we are police support Senate Bill 180
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
relative to product labeling and
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
information guide requirements for
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
cannabis products and the prohibition of
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
sale of hemp products containing certain
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
levels of THC while the farm bill of
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
2018 allowed hemp to be defined in the
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
legislation as a cannabis plant yes the
 
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
same ones that produce marijuana there
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
is one key difference that hemp cannot
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
contain more than 0.3 percent of THC
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the key is that that compound in the
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
plant is most commonly associated with
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
people getting some type of high and
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
that more than 0.3 percent is where that
 
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
psychoactive opportunity begins in the
 
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.329 align:start position:0%
psychoactive opportunity begins in the
brain

00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
brain
 
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
in short
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
what was passed in the farm bill is that
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
hemp should not be able to get you high
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
but the bill allowed Innovative new
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis products to be created that can
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
give you that similar feeling like a
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
Delta a or a Delta 9. and like in all
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
Industries innovation without regulation
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
can have a negative impact
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
to that end New Hampshire can wants to
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
participate in creating an adult use
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
cannabis Market that New Hampshire can
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
be proud of
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
allowing hemp derived Tac products to be
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
sold without mandatory ID checks
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
consumer education or independent lab
 
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
testing is irresponsible public policy
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
and undermines the goals expressed by
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
this committee when passing House Bill
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
639 it's important that regulation in
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
any type of consumer-oriented ingested
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
product is followed intelligently
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
support South Senate Bill 180 so that we
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
can ensure that all THC products are
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
sold within a reasonably regulated
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
system this bill was developed with
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
guidance from a coalition of
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the medicinal industry
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals Educators
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and proponents of the adult
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
use industry it's important that the
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
proponents one of the key proponents of
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
the adult use industry New Hampshire can
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
is here to support this bill
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire touts itself is
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
pro-business and supports individual
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
liberties and local control once low
 
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
taxes wants to draw young people to our
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
state but we can do all this and we can
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
protect our consumers we can protect our
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
young people it's important that
 
00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
previous testimony noted that there is
 
00:46:22.859 --> 00:46:24.470 align:start position:0%
previous testimony noted that there is
no

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.930 align:start position:0%
no
age

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
delineation on being able to acquire
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
this product
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
in fact I did a test of similar to what
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
Matt did when this came out I was
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
actually in Florida I walked into a
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
convenience store I purchased it
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't ask me anything I remembered
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
it vividly because I had been a
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
proponent of uh you know legalization
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
for the last 15 years
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I was surprised by
 
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
that was just hanging up there with the
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
key chains and the gum and the mints
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
right at the counter where you can make
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
your impulse Buy
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
so it's important that we figure out how
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
to regulate it and if
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
a house bill 639 does pass through the
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
Senate and does become law in the state
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions in that bill to
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
help regulate this industry it's our
 
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.950 align:start position:0%
help regulate this industry it's our
assessment

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire can that Republic that
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
responsible public policy can be
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
accomplished with Senate bill 180. so I
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time and I'll
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
do my best to answer any questions
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
yeah perfect thank you representative
 
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
Gibbs did you have a question
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh yes this is the
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
question that I was going to ask the
 
00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
question that I was going to ask the
previous

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
um uh testifier
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
um uh is it your expectation that
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill third house bill 639
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and the um uh process that will be
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
established assuming that that is
 
00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
established assuming that that is
enacted

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
um would greatly reduce the
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
attractiveness of any products uh such
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
as are described in this bill if they
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
were to be sold on the black market
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
quickly I'll say yes but I would like to
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
explain that I think what's important in
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 639 that was uh as well in
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
some of the Amendments was that we
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
included an educational aspect of if
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
legalization was then passed that the
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
consumers of New Hampshire would be
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
educated about what is in adult use THC
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
products and I think that's an important
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
part that would come out in this was be
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
able to explain that there are other
 
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
derivative products that could be
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
harmful to you
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
and explain the the difference between
 
00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099 align:start position:0%
adult use flour or edibles and a Delta 9
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
or a Delta a and so yes you're
 
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
that bill would help
 
00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
better educate consumers and warn them
 
00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
better educate consumers and warn them
about

00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
products that are produced without
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
regulation without control and it could
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
potentially be manipulated by the black
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
market which we have seen in Vape
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
cartridges tied to cigarette vaping
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
spear

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you have you noticed if
 
00:49:19.319 --> 00:49:20.569 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you have you noticed if
this

00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
is tracking any of the poisoning is in
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
problems that are happening with these
 
00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
Oddball unregulated
 
00:49:28.619 --> 00:49:29.809 align:start position:0%
Oddball unregulated
um

00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
hemp products I have not been following
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
that actually you're just going to give
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
me more homework to do because actually
 
00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
that'd be wise to do
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
um but like similar testimony I think
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
we're understanding that
 
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.930 align:start position:0%
we're understanding that
until

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
we begin to look into the
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
reasonings why there are
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
poisonings or ER visits or all of the
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
commentary that opponents to adult use
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis have articulated making sure
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we understand where those numbers
 
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
come from and what it's attributed to
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
blending their cannabis with something
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
else are they using products like Delta
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
8 and Delta 9. I think that would be an
 
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
important piece of research and again
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's also in House Bill 639 is
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
studying the impact of it so that we
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
understand what our regulation does I
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
think if I may commend this committee
 
00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:30.380 align:start position:0%
and commend ways and means you all took
 
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
a intelligent amount of time in a
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
bipartisan conversation to create good
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that has gone over
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
to the Senate we're hoping that the
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
Senate sees that but I think the
 
00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:44.300 align:start position:0%
research part the study of impact part
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
the protections and support for law
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and utilization of
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
operating vehicle under use
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
of a substance those are all things that
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
are in that bill that I think will help
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
solve some of these problems that
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
outlier Industries like Delta and Delta
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
9 are giving the bad name for the adult
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
our questions
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
so I think I heard you earlier in your
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned that you
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
purchased a vape pen in the State of
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
Florida is that correct yes sir so this
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
is a nationwide issue and I'm curious
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
what other states we can't be the first
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
ones to notice this right what other
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
states are
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
what approach are other states taking
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
you know on the spectrum of legalization
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
to a complete prohibition and there's a
 
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
spectrum there what other other states
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
are doing if I would thank you for the
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
question I wish I could tell you that I
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
had time to focus on the issue with
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 and Delta 9 in other states
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
obviously I've been focused on the you
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
know the issue with adult use here in
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well as in the state of
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
Vermont where I'm an educator in the
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
Castleton cannabis studies program but
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
you just gave me an assignment for my
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
students next semester which is to look
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
at the impact of Delta and Delta 9
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
because I have not been able to I've
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
obviously been focused on
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
sort of what I would refer to as job one
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
which was making a smart intelligent
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
um sorry for the repetitive intelligent
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
you know use adult use here
 
00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:25.849 align:start position:0%
you know use adult use here
um

00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
I will get back to you on that though
 
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sure our next
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
speaker will have an answer for that
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much thank you
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
very much everyone okay Kate you you get
 
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
the last word
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.059 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
name is Kate Frye from new Futures at
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
Public Health policy organization that
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
works on
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
um many different Health policy issues
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
including Alcohol and Other Drugs uh
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
issues so that's why I'm here today
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be very brief because you've
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
heard a lot on this issue but we are
 
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
here in support of this bill it is uh an
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
issue that you are correct New Hampshire
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
is not the only state that is dealing
 
00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
um other states are dealing with this I
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
have provided you a handout that does
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
give you background information already
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
very um candidly provided to you by
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
other speakers about the issue but also
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
what other states have done regarding um
 
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
trying to get their hands around this
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
issue this loophole I do agree with
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
representative hunt that this is very
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
similar to some other issues that we've
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
looked at in the past to me this reminds
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
me a lot of the issue we had
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
this reminds me of what you always say
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
when I was in the room when this
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
happened is that the powdered alcohol
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
issue that we had 10 years ago or so
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
where again this issue was coming up uh
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
somewhat dangerous
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
um product was being created and there
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
was no Authority
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
um within the state to regulate it and
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
so it did remind me of the fact that the
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Liquor Commission was
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
granted authority to then
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
if it was to come into the state to take
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
care of it so I did want you to know
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
ahead of time that I did have
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Liquor Commission
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
um they do see this product they are
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
concerned about this product they were
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to be here today they have said
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the past that
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
um by prohibiting it that would be easy
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
for them at this point to just say you
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
know you can't sell these in the state
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
um to move into more of a regular story
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
structure would obviously be uh more
 
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
financially uh they need more resources
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and that's something that they you
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
know you can have that discussion with
 
00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:17.510 align:start position:0%
know you can have that discussion with
them

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
um but it would be because they already
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
the way I understand that have the
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
licensure authority over most of these
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
stores that are selling these except for
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
maybe CBD stores that they would have
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
the authority to say these products
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be sold here
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
as far as you know
 
00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:40.619 align:start position:0%
down the line what this could look at
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
some states have chosen to have them in
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
the regulatory structure and I think
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
that would be fine if we chose to go in
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
that direction I think the major concern
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
as you heard is really just about the
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
safety of these so we would just expect
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
to have the same standard of making sure
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
that they are lab tested these products
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
are safe but I think we are a little
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
down the line from that because we don't
 
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
have a regulatory structure for cannabis
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
or hemp at this point so I think this is
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward by prohibiting it
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
at this time and again I would defer you
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
to The Liquor Commission but I think our
 
00:56:20.329 --> 00:56:20.339 align:start position:0%
conversations were that they identify
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
this as a problem and felt that this was
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
a good solution for now
 
00:56:25.559 --> 00:56:26.690 align:start position:0%
a good solution for now
okay

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
questions representative purselli do you
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
happen to know if this product is being
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
manufactured in New Hampshire or is it
 
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:39.059 align:start position:0%
all brought in from other states I think
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
defer to others but my understanding for
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
the most part it's brought in from other
 
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:46.430 align:start position:0%
the most part it's brought in from other
states

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:56:48.359 --> 00:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
sure

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
there's still an open question of what
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
other states are doing to address this
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
issue I think you said and the last page
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
of this document it gives you kind of a
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
summary of different approaches other
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
states have taken
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
around it so you know under uh on page
 
00:57:09.049 --> 00:57:09.059 align:start position:0%
five so prohibit
 
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
um the manufacturing salaries that's
 
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
kind of I think what this bill is doing
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
North Dakota is doing that
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
um regulating it it's showing you what
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
states have some states or I don't think
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
it points out specifically which states
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
but it kind of shows you different
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
structures and I can probably get you a
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
more detailed map somewhere too this is
 
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
somewhat new so it's evolving as we go
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
along but it does show you different
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory structures or different poly
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
structures states have taken
 
00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:41.540 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
in uh you're providing that information
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
is there a way that you can give us
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
specific legislation bills in other
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
states I think yeah I can look into it
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
all right great I don't know if I can do
 
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:54.020 align:start position:0%
it by this afternoon when you're exactly
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
but it's just a subcommittee so yeah I
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
can see what I can find see what you can
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
find first that'd be great
 
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.270 align:start position:0%
find first that'd be great
okay

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're all set thank you very much we'll
 
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:07.140 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing uh Senate Bill
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
180 I would say that uh online there was
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
two support and four opposed to this
 
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:13.870 align:start position:0%
two support and four opposed to this
bill

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
and uh one one uh the blue sheets uh
 
00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth sergeant from the New
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of chiefs of
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
police are in support of the bill
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
with that we'll move right on to our
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
next bill Senate Bill 201 and I see
 
00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.150 align:start position:0%
next bill Senate Bill 201 and I see
senator

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
Chancellor

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning I apologize
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
for this delay but I'm sure you found
 
00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
that that hearing very entertaining
 
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
yes and it's interesting because I serve
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
on Commerce and Judiciary in the Senate
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I was thinking did I hear this bill
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
which in which committee did I hear this
 
00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.950 align:start position:0%
which in which committee did I hear this
bill

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
um so good morning members of the
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Shannon shandley
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I represent uh Senate District 11 in
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
the state senate
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
um it is my privilege to be here before
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
you for a second time this session
 
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
um this time on a wholly different topic
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce Senate Bill 201 an
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
act relative to the sale of event
 
00:59:28.619 --> 00:59:30.289 align:start position:0%
act relative to the sale of event
tickets

00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I will note that this bill was
 
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.030 align:start position:0%
um I will note that this bill was
changed

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
amended significantly in the Senate and
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
I I think that the current bill before
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
you is
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
um is a very good bill and one which I
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
will ask for you to look favorably upon
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
quite simply this bill provides some
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
very limited but much needed protection
 
00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
for our New Hampshire small businesses
 
01:00:02.329 --> 01:00:02.339 align:start position:0%
and our consumers
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of people here who
 
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
can give you first-hand accounts of
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
their experiences
 
01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:13.819 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh tickets that are sold
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
online for events at their venues which
 
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
are not authorized by their venues it
 
01:00:25.569 --> 01:00:25.579 align:start position:0%
leads to a tremendous confusion
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
loss of income often the consumers do
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
not even have the ticket they thought
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
that they were purchasing
 
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
now let me give you just a little bit of
 
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.450 align:start position:0%
now let me give you just a little bit of
background

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so shortly after the start of the
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic the governor uh
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
established the governor's task force on
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
reopening and I uh to which Governor
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
sununu appointed me and it was our job
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
to look at all various sectors of the
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
economy and kind of figure out under
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
which conditions that each could safely
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
reopen to the public that task for that
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
task force did its job and and worked
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
very closely from the start of the
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic through probably
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
May or June of 2020 but one of the
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
things that came about I'd worked very
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
closely with folks in the Arts Community
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
both the per Performing and the visual
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
arts and with individuals and
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
organizations and uh one of the
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
Silver Linings and I think it's hard to
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
say the pandemic had a silver lining but
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
one of the good things that came out of
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
the task force and the work that was
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
being done among the Arts Community is
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
the way folks join together to problem
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
solve and collaborate and Advocate and I
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
would say that this bill sb201 is a
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
product of that continued problem
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
solving and collaboration
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh the Performing Arts were incredibly
 
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
hard hit by the pandemic and they have
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
recovered uh somewhat more slowly than
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
other sectors and the community
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
continues to meet to address the
 
01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:19.619 align:start position:0%
problems one significant issue that has
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
emerged is um the unau authorized
 
01:02:25.569 --> 01:02:25.579 align:start position:0%
reselling of event tickets at Cost
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
significantly above the face value by
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
online outfits that are not affiliated
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
with the venue but often give the
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
appearance of being associated with that
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
venue uh the digital component of this
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
ticket reselling really has exacerbated
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
and intensified the offense and its
 
01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.450 align:start position:0%
and intensified the offense and its
consequences

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
it's often deceptive includes fraud and
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
fakery and there are some stories that I
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
know you will hear that will Boggle your
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
mind perhaps
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
this isn't you know I'm not talking
 
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.609 align:start position:0%
this isn't you know I'm not talking
about

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:03:07.619 --> 01:03:08.270 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
the big National problem that many of us
 
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
have heard about what I'm really talking
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
about is
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
um the problem as as it exists for the
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
producing and presenting venues and for
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
the patrons in the state of New
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our constituents are
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
purchasing tickets from what they
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
believe to be a venue box office for
 
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
sums well above the actual ticket price
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is they could go
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
to the venue or to The Venue website and
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
purchase a ticket often for one-third of
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
the price that is showing up on the
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
quite often the tickets don't exist at
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
all or the vendors selling them the
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
ticket doesn't yet own the ticket so
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
they purchase a ticket and then the
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
vendor from which they purchased the
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
ticket then goes to the box office
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
purchase the tickets on
 
01:04:10.609 --> 01:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
sells it gets it to the patron
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with this is
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes that ticket's already been
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
sold it's not available so uh they are
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily getting the
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:25.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
what this bill does in its amended
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
version is it requires those venues
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
which are selling the tickets uh to
 
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.730 align:start position:0%
which are selling the tickets uh to
patrons

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
patrons
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
to do a few very simple things it
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
requires them to prominently display uh
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
in bold type
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
certain conditions first that the seller
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
may not actually own the ticket that the
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
seller is a different entity from the
 
01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.329 align:start position:0%
seller is a different entity from the
venue

01:04:58.329 --> 01:04:58.339 align:start position:0%
venue
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
that the ticket may be part of a of a
 
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
block or a Zone and isn't necessarily
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
the one the person thinks he or she is
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing and um and then finally it
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
requires the purchaser to acknowledge
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
that the purchaser is aware of those
 
01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:18.430 align:start position:0%
that the purchaser is aware of those
circumstances

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
really important to our small businesses
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
in the state and certainly important to
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
our consumers that we pass this piece of
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm happy to take any
 
01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
questions and I do want to assure you
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
that the folks who will speak after me
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
can tell you the specifics about what
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
they have encountered in their
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
businesses thank you Mr chair
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I've been caught in this kind
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
of thing myself and it's it's it's
 
01:05:51.059 --> 01:05:52.370 align:start position:0%
of thing myself and it's it's it's
horrible

01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
horrible
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
but the problem
 
01:05:59.210 --> 01:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
how would you legislate an out-of-state
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
organization who's doing these kind of
 
01:06:02.099 --> 01:06:03.829 align:start position:0%
organization who's doing these kind of
shenanigans

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
shenanigans
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
to pay any attention to it I mean
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
Nothing Stops anybody from putting
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
anything they want online
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
um well I I guess I would
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
disagree a little bit that not there are
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
things just to discourage people and I
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
think having
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General's office the
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
consumer protection division uh act on
 
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
this if this is a violation of Law and
 
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:34.220 align:start position:0%
an organization is
 
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
engaging in it that can be filed with
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and the
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
consumer protection division can act on
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
it I will say you know there are
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
penalties in place that they can uh
 
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.010 align:start position:0%
penalties in place that they can uh
put

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:48.020 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
what's the word I'm looking for that
 
01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
they can uh put upon the
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
um those who violate it
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying it's going to resolve
 
01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
all of our problems but I'm saying it's
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do to protect the
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
consumer and to protect the businesses
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the state it is hard I I certainly do
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
not disagree at all that enforcement of
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
this kind of uh consumer of this kind of
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
violation can be difficult but it
 
01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:21.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we don't try
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I have one question
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
um regarding uh the options given for
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
what must be disclosed and essentially
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
the the seller
 
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
um has three options of what to disclose
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
one is that they don't actually own the
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
ticket the other is that
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
um uh it's a different entity than the
 
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
venue where the event or performance is
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
to be held and the third is that it's
 
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's a block
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
um uh zone or or
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
some other category uh rather than an
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
individual ticket
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
um if the seller say does not actually
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
own the ticket and is a different entity
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
than the venue where the uh event is to
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
be held
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
um don't we want both of those things
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
disclosed not just one or the other is
 
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
if I were buying a ticket I would want
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
to know always whether or not the seller
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
actually owns the ticket and whether or
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
not the seller is actually
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the box office uh where I thought I
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
was going to buy the ticket from
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question my
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
understanding and my intent is that all
 
01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:47.660 align:start position:0%
of those things would have to be
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
disclosed if
 
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
all of them were true whichever one is
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
true all must be disclosed and if um if
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
for some reason we think the wording
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
isn't saying that we you know I'm open
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
to to Really buying that problem then
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
follow up then uh we do need to uh
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
revise a language to say and we will we
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
will be putting this bill the
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and working it thank you
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I may have not read read the amended
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which version I read but I
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
guess I wanted to clarify that this
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
would not not impact an individual who
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
had a ticket they couldn't use selling
 
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
to a friend not a you know to another
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
person perfect thank you
 
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
even though it doesn't say that that
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be online
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
right the Bill's supposed to be an
 
01:09:44.209 --> 01:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
online purchase yes these are yeah if it
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't even though it doesn't say it it
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
self okay
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you mentioned loss of
 
01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
income I'm curious what loss of income
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
so and this is a this is a uh
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh can be a very big question a
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
difficult question for the venues one
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
way that it would result in loss of
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
income is dependent on how the venue
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
handles it so for example
 
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
um a person may purchase two tickets to
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
go see an event at one of our local
 
01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
theaters the person purchases the
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
tickets from one of these online
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
resources and it turns out when the
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
people get to the venue the tickets are
 
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
not good that they were somehow they
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
either were not purchased the seat has
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
been sold twice it is a fake
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
um then the venue then has to deal with
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
some very disturbed and upset patrons
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's the people at the box office who
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
then have to try to explain the
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
situation and the folks who sent who
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
paid the money are out they have lost
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
that money so those so one way or
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
another someone has lost money the
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
people who paid the paid for the tickets
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
that don't exist would have lost their
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
money the box office and I believe that
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
in sometimes the box offices will find
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
those patrons a seat but they're not
 
01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
being paid a second time for the seat so
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
the box office is actually out because
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
they didn't they're they're providing
 
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.070 align:start position:0%
they didn't they're they're providing
um

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
a ticket to people who didn't actually
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
pay them for the ticket and the other
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
issue which is a little bit more
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
complicated and isn't addressed
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily by this bill but it is what
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
are you paying for and the idea is that
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
you're paying for your ticket is in some
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
ways a license it's a license to sit in
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
a particular seat for a particular
 
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
a particular seat for a particular
performance

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and you know it's a different
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
question I think who who can
 
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.010 align:start position:0%
question I think who who can
um

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
who has established that contract in
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
between which parties does that contract
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
exist but that is a slightly different
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
issue from the one that this bill
 
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.189 align:start position:0%
issue from the one that this bill
addresses

01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
further question okay so what you just
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
described at least a situation where
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
somebody goes in and they don't actually
 
01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:21.659 align:start position:0%
have the tickets or they're fake I mean
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
that to me already sounds illegal so I'm
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
not sure how this law would fix that or
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
is there some Gap in our law that allows
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
this illegal what sounds like should be
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
an illegal practice to exist
 
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I think it's selling a fraudulent
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
tickets should be legal right no yes it
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
should be and I think that this makes it
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
very clear so one of the things we have
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
so for example let's say
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
um a person comes in and says well I
 
01:12:48.179 --> 01:12:49.330 align:start position:0%
um a person comes in and says well I
paid

01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:49.340 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
150 dollars for this ticket but I see
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
right here that you're selling tickets
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
for fifty dollars that often it's it's
 
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
creating a problem with the venue and I
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
think one of the things you'll hear well
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know buyers should be aware of these
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
things these many of these websites are
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
set up so well and you are so easily
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
directed to them that buyers buyers
 
01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
can't be aware of things that aren't
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
disclosed to them so what I'm this bill
 
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
is attempting to do is
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
attempting to help the buyer be aware
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
by putting in the
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
um conditions under which the ticket is
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
being sold
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking our
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
questions I guess I have two unrelated
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions if I may uh the first one is
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
what is the penalty if someone is caught
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
doing this what so uh it would be
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's uh write a prayer of action you
 
01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
oh you can pursue it yourself you're the
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
right of private action
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
another question uh second unrelated
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
question uh I'll paint a scenario uh
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's a concept I really want to see
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
the tickets are very expensive maybe
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's Barry Manilow or Bert Bacharach or
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
or Neil Diamond
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
but some something I really want to say
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
I've been Dynasty but then I have a
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
family emergency
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I I spent all this money on these
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
tickets and the money means a lot to me
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
and I want to sell the tickets on eBay
 
01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
so I can recoup my money does this would
 
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
this apply to me I don't think it does
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
we've written it was originally the bit
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
way the bill was written it would have
 
01:14:42.410 --> 01:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
applied to you I think in this case if
 
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
you're selling something on eBay eBay
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's a completely different
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.090 --> 01:14:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have a lot of other people
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
but I think okay representative here
 
01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
it's a short question
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
we have you listed some things in the
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
bill that that need to be on those
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
websites that are selling the tickets
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that that all seems fine
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we have information on the
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
venue itself putting up information
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
because let's say I'm gonna go buy I'm
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
going to go to a concert the first thing
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is go to the venue
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
and there should be some kind of big
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing here don't buy the tickets unless
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
you see these things otherwise I
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even know
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
that there is an issue I do think that
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
is a very good question and I know that
 
01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
two of the other folks who are here
 
01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
um are affiliated with venues and can
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
really address that better than I can I
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
do know also and I suggest I really ask
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
all of you to um
 
01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:54.980 align:start position:0%
go online
 
01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:58.340 align:start position:0%
choose one of the concerts that or uh
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
performances that are taking place in
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
the state go online and uh
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
I would even suggest you know go online
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
and just see what the process is see how
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
quickly you can be redirected to a site
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
that isn't the
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
um authorized venue and then see what
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
kind of information is available to you
 
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
there you it's it's fascinating when you
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
um we have so many wonderful uh small
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
venues in our state every one of you
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
probably has
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
um or if not in your District nearby
 
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:37.100 align:start position:0%
your District
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
reach out to those folks the people who
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
are in your area or near your area and
 
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
ask them if they've encountered this
 
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
problem and what they are trying to do
 
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh thank you Mr
 
01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.310 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh thank you Mr
chairman

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.090 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
isn't the problem and this is something
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
that I've run into not actually with
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
concert venues myself but rather with
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
hotels that you can go online and search
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
for something and be directed rather
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
than to what you thought you were
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
going to purchase something from instead
 
01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
to a broker as I said this has happened
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
to me with hotels where I went online to
 
01:17:28.689 --> 01:17:28.699 align:start position:0%
search for a hotel to reserve a room and
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
discovered later on that the site where
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
I had reserved the room and put down a
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
deposit was actually a broker not the
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
hotel and I only found this out when
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
um uh when I discovered that customer
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
service okay I think I think I think we
 
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
get the question so we got the question
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
we know the question yes I think she
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
gets the question isn't that the problem
 
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
that when you search for the venue you
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
may in fact get something else and if
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
that other site doesn't tell you
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
downside of the internet that is correct
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
yes and I think that that is this will
 
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
help consumers understand what they're
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
what they're doing so putting the
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
warning on the menu website wouldn't
 
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
solve the problem okay thank you
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.490 align:start position:0%
would you believe
yes

01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much you're
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for your consideration
 
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
so we do have several vendors here but
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
what I think the next person I want to
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
bring up Mary Stewart from the Attorney
 
01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:35.300 align:start position:0%
General's office
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
who doesn't take a position but would
 
01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:40.940 align:start position:0%
like to give us some insight on
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this statute
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass it thank you
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
um Tucson okay yeah yeah so I'm Mary
 
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
Stewart from the consumer protection
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
Division and yes so the the way this
 
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
bill is structured which is good it's in
 
01:18:58.970 --> 01:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
the as a violation if you
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
um do not do these proper disclosures it
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
would be a violation that a consumer
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
protection statute so to answer one of
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General can clearly
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
enforce uh New Hampshire law against
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
entities that are out of state that are
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
doing business in New Hampshire so it
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
would cover that and the damages that
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
are available under the consumer
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
protection statute would also be damages
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
that a person could pursue which are
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
actual damages but if we do it it would
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
be restitution and possible civil
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
penalties as well so so there are so
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
that whole piece is is good we do have a
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
just one concern really about in
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement and that is
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
and this was kind of alluded to to some
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
of the questions the term seller is not
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in the statute so in the
 
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
situation of if a consumer were to file
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
a complaint they bought a ticket online
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
let's say the online platform was more
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
of a broker instead of the actual
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
individual that was selling the ticket
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
it raises a question of who is
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
responsible to provide these disclosures
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
is it the broker like StubHub or some of
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
those others entities or is it the
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
actual individual
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
and that just goes to who are we
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
pursuing who are we seeking to enforce
 
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:27.980 align:start position:0%
the statute against
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
and that's our primary comment the other
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
thing and this could just be are
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
just we weren't sure where when you say
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
a ticket is being resold in a block zone
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
or other specific grouping of ticket
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
that wasn't really clear to us what that
 
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.870 align:start position:0%
that wasn't really clear to us what that
meant

01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
meant
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
um or my third comment which we didn't
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
catch but was an excellent comment that
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
was made is if all of these I totally
 
01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
agree that the way this is written only
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
even if all three of these disclosures
 
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.910 align:start position:0%
even if all three of these disclosures
were

01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
apply to the ticket the way the statute
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
is written only one would have to be
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
disclosed technically so that certainly
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
should be addressed as well
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have any questions uh
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
Evan we do representative Terry so to be
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
in response to this your concern
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
is that this might actually
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
apply to representative Ammon who is
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
attempting to resell his ticket on eBay
 
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.350 align:start position:0%
attempting to resell his ticket on eBay
well

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
we actually talked about that and we
 
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
don't think it would because because
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
this is under the consumer protection
 
01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
act which regulates Trader Commerce and
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
individual that's not kind of in the
 
01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
business of selling tickets wouldn't
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily fall under the larger scope
 
01:21:55.729 --> 01:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
of the ACT
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
is that further questions is that clear
 
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
from your reading of the statute or
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
could it be clearer or is this just your
 
01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
could it be clearer or is this just your
interpretation

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
So based on defining the seller I think
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
that's why defining who the seller is is
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
really important yeah seller needs work
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
so it needs work okay representative
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I'm just looking
 
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
at uh line 11 on page two where it talks
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
about acknowledgment
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
and it uses some uh like in Internet
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
terms with check boxes and radio buttons
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
and so forth so if I'm
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
if I'm on the street and I'm wearing a
 
01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
trench coat
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
and I open it up to you and I say would
 
01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:41.219 align:start position:0%
you like to buy some tickets
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh what what would the acknowledgment
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.890 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
what was the acknowledgment I guess you
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
it has to have some indication of
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment so
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
this is contemplating
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
that this the purchaser I mean you'd
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to show that the purchaser
 
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
acknowledges your
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
the disclosures that you are making I
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
guess I mean arguably I would say would
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
need to be in writing you know some sort
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
of writing I don't think that this bill
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
is is really targeted to kind of
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
person-to-person sales right so let's
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
get back to the sponsor said yeah it was
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
it was a tent that this was an internet
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
transaction yeah so again there's this
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
if we're going to pass this there's a
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
lot more meat that needs to be added
 
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
that needs to be added I would say yes
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
yep okay thank you very much thank you
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
all right now we have
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
three venues we'll start off with a
 
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
former state legislator Peter Ramsey
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's good to be back I was here for
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
about uh 30 years
 
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:03.140 align:start position:0%
starting at 21 and uh loved my time here
 
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
and uh am very proud and thank you all
 
01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
for serving it's hard to be a a elected
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative nowadays it's not easy I
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
don't think it ever was Mr chairman but
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you all for serving so
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
um I run the Palace Theater in
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire I'm very proud
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
to do that I want to thank senator
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
chandley for her great work on this uh
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
she's become a good friend over the last
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
four years she made a tremendous
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
difference during covid the Palace
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
Theater for example was close to 17
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
months it cost us seven million dollars
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
and Senator chandley helped us raise
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
some money it was wonderful
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
so to go to this bill this is a bit
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
complicated and I brought my phone not
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
to be rude Mr chairman but but if you
 
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
type in Palace Theater
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
um you you you automatically will see
 
01:24:58.689 --> 01:24:58.699 align:start position:0%
four or five
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
ticket sellers I don't call them
 
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
resellers they are they have copied our
 
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.450 align:start position:0%
resellers they are they have copied our
website

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
and they are selling our tickets to
 
01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
every show we do uh we will do this year
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
about 400 different events uh we opened
 
01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.890 align:start position:0%

rent

01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
rent
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
um on Friday night it's our production
 
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:20.219 align:start position:0%

01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%

01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
Friday night we had 600 people at the
 
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
theater in Manchester from all over New
 
01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.510 align:start position:0%

England
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
um and a woman came up to the box office
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
five minutes before the show and said my
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
ticket won't work at the door we have a
 
01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:42.020 align:start position:0%
um a ticket scanner at the door
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
and she said my ticket doesn't work well
 
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
if you looked at the ticket it wasn't
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
our ticket it was a fake ticket sold by
 
01:25:54.970 --> 01:25:54.980 align:start position:0%
Vivid tickets which is a big operation
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
and she our tickets uh if you call the
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
box office or go under our website are
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
no more than forty five dollars that's
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
what we charge on purpose we're a
 
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
non-profit venue we want people in New
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Manchester to come to the
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
Palace to be to improve their their
 
01:26:18.490 --> 01:26:18.500 align:start position:0%
everyday life
 
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
we work hard at keeping our tickets
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
cheaper this poor woman had paid 200 a
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
ticket she had two tickets
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
she wanted number one she wanted a
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
ticket that worked number two she wanted
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
her money back well the Palace Theater
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
can't give money back I never got the
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
money it was sold to this Vivid website
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
and on the top of the Vivid website
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
in very small letters you can't really
 
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
see you can't see it on your cell phone
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
it says ticket reseller was it isn't
 
01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:51.890 align:start position:0%
it says ticket reseller was it isn't
reselling

01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
reselling
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
they are copying our our business in
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
selling it online and I think my friend
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
Sal from the capital Center will repeat
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
the same thing I'm telling you it's it's
 
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
only been going on for about two years
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
it it never happened in the old days as
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
I said I've been at the palace for 25
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
years it never used to happen
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um there there always were people who
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
had bought four tickets two other
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
friends couldn't come they would stand
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
outside and try to sell it I never
 
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
complained about it I was happy they
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
were there
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes and giving tickets away
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
to friends or something and that's fine
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill is is addressing
 
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
that at all uh this bill is not perfect
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
but it's a good start and and I think
 
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not here on behalf of the palace I'm
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of our consumers we will
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
sell about 150
 
01:27:49.129 --> 01:27:49.139 align:start position:0%
000 tickets this year
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
almost every night of the week
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
and our consumers every night are being
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
affected by this because think about it
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
somebody tells you oh go see rents at
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
the palace it's a great show
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
you pick up your cell phone oh gee I
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
hope I can get tickets and you don't
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
I've done it before myself I was in uh
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
obviously Manchester England and wanted
 
01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
to go see a sold out soccer game I ended
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
up paying way too much and and I was
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
offended and I had trouble getting into
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
place but uh so it happens all the time
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's big big business for these for
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
these fake websites so I'm happy to
 
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh it's very
 
01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.229 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh it's very
complicated

01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and I'm so proud to have the Attorney
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
General's office here because I think
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
they could make a big difference
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much Mr chairman it's
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
good to see you again and uh I'm happy
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
to questions representative thackson
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
hi I've never been to your theater and I
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but well if you want
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
to come I'll get you two free tickets
 
01:28:58.450 --> 01:28:58.460 align:start position:0%
you can come next Friday
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
if they're over 25 you have to claim
 
01:29:04.689 --> 01:29:04.699 align:start position:0%
them I'm sorry Mr chairman you're right
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry they're 45 that's a problem
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
but no I couldn't claim them uh but my
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
real point is so while you were talking
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
I looked at this I found this Vivid
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
Seats thing yep and you'll be happy to
 
01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
know when I searched the first thing
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
that came up was your theater site
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
I had to actually go all the way down
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
the page to find Vivid Seats oh good and
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
so they claim
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
that they have a hundred percent and I'm
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
just I want perspective on this that's
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not advertising for them uh
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
they have a 100 million seats sold 100
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
buyer guarantee there's no way in here I
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know that but the thing that I
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure I understood
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
the words you said correctly
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
in their website they say the average C
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
at your theater is 95 88.
 
01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
is that correct I thought you said forty
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
five dollars well this is where it gets
 
01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
really complicated the average price is
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
95 if I buy it from them on on on Vivid
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
but that's not reselling because they
 
01:30:15.169 --> 01:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
don't have my ticket
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
well that's what I'm trying to
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
understand because if I think it's fraud
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
I mean well the question is is that
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
they'll say they'll go get the ticket
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
for you but you're going to pay twice as
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
much absolutely for us to do the the
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
legwork for you but but on on so
 
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
um it's very complicated but
 
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
but and I'd love to hear what the
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office has to say
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
about this but she's left the room oh
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
they are not selling my ticket or our
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
ticket at The Palace Theater we can show
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
our tickets sure and what they're doing
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
is copying our website
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
are are
 
01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
um uh show the advertising for the show
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
which in itself is illegal I have to pay
 
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
rights to advertise for rent
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
they're not doing that they're selling
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
to the poor consumer
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
a 95 dollar ticket that I could have
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
gone on the first website that came up
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
and bought from you for 45 bucks correct
 
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
which I assume you would email to me or
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
whatever correct or or you could pick it
 
01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:25.940 align:start position:0%
up at the box office
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm old school I'd probably pick it
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
up at the box right right and and 70
 
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
it's funny when I first started in the
 
01:31:35.689 --> 01:31:35.699 align:start position:0%
theater business
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
99 of tickets were bought in person yeah
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
now 70 percent are bought online so this
 
01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
is a real problem for the venues in New
 
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:47.450 align:start position:0%
is a real problem for the venues in New
Hampshire

01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
but probably venues every place but
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
correct our concerns representative
 
01:31:51.179 --> 01:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
correct our concerns representative
spear

01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
I mean they're obviously doing some
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
illegal stuff I agree I have tried we've
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time on this and uh I've
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
called the FBI
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
um uh and a lot of different law
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement people and it's really hard
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
to take action on a two hundred dollar
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
well Friday night would have been a 400
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
fraud in
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I have a follow-on question and the
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
the hooker is that they haven't
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
defrauded us they've defrauded the poor
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
consumer and now unfortunately the
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
credit card companies are not making the
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
patron hole so this woman started to cry
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
it it was awful but but for the question
 
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
main choir
 
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
you've said that they've they don't have
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
the right to advertise rent you know the
 
01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
in the case that this thing because you
 
01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:55.460 align:start position:0%
own the rights that's a violation
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
against you
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
if the FBI can't help and anybody else
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
can't help
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
how are we going to happen so well let's
 
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
say basically why have you had asked
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
rent whether they care enough to have
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
them pursue the case because I'm sure
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
they got lawyers and I have not but it's
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
a good idea Mr chairman yeah it's a good
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
idea so because they're the ones who are
 
01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
harmed you know because you have to show
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
harm right exactly you're not doing harm
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
it has to be the consumer to bring the
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
case so okay
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
any other and representative Yemen thank
 
01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:30.380 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just want to understand
 
01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
how this bill applies to the scenario
 
01:33:34.729 --> 01:33:34.739 align:start position:0%
that you painted so the website has a
 
01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
very tiny font right then the bill says
 
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's got to be 14 point font so that's
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
that would apply and then one of the
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
three conditions has to be displayed
 
01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:48.260 align:start position:0%
and then there's some kind of
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment check box on the on the
 
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
checkout but other than that that
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
website that you they can charge
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
whatever they want
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
um they can't defraud a customer
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
obviously they have to provide a ticket
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
for some price but
 
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
um this bill would modify that
 
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
reseller's website to to this degree and
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
then they would still be able to operate
 
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
provided they they give the ticket is
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
well it's complicated and as I said and
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm serious about this I don't think
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
this is a perfect bill I I think it's a
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
great first start and I'm proud of what
 
01:34:25.129 --> 01:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
the Senate did I think it's going to
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
help the consumer in that if someone
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
defraud it for four or five hundred
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
dollars I think that person then could
 
01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
call the New Hampshire Attorney
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
General's office and let them go to and
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
go to work
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
um if if Vivid
 
01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:43.460 align:start position:0%
um Ticket Company wherever they are
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
if they start getting letters and
 
01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
notices from the Attorney General's
 
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
office in New Hampshire
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
for 10 or 15 or 20 people defrauded I
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
think eventually they're going to take
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
action right now there's nothing I can
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
say to that poor consumer because I
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
never had the money
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's horrible for the consumer is it a
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
pain in the neck for the Palace Theater
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely and we're deeply affected
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
by it it happens every single day
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
for the question uh it's my
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
understanding maybe this is for
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that that scenario would
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
would be illegal or at least our
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
consumer protection laws would apply to
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
that fraud scenario existing laws would
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
apply if if I was an attorney in the
 
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office in New
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would make the call if I
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
started to get calls from consumers and
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of them
 
01:35:44.110 --> 01:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
consumers that have been I think it's
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
fraudible I guess um if someone has a
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
little bit of experience about the
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act uh the question
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
would be is
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
um have an almost standing Vivid I
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
assume they're not a New Hampshire
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
entity no I don't think so and they
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't have any brick and mortar in New
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire probably not so the question
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
is has any
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
reseller in New Hampshire had been a
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
problem not that I know of right and
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
that's really the fundamental problem
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to be the enforcement yeah okay
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
oh representative Michael here thank you
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just a quick question the
 
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
guy with four tickets outside your
 
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
theater selling the two extra ones
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
because his friends didn't show up is
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
that legal in New Hampshire or illegal
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
um scalping I never complained because
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
it never bothered us I was just happy
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
they came
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
um honestly I do not know
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh no we do not have a ticking scalping
 
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire
 
01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.179 align:start position:0%
that's the last time I have seen you at
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I appreciate it thank you
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
representing Nashua Center for the Arts
 
01:37:08.169 --> 01:37:08.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um still morning
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
my name is Peter Lally I'm the president
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
of spectacle live and uh we have uh
 
01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
venue operations in New Hampshire
 
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Rhode Island in New
 
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we operate
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh the Colonial Theater in Laconia as
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
well as the newly opened Nashville
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
Center for the Arts and we also do the
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
booking for the Flying Monkey in
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
Plymouth New Hampshire uh and I'd like
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
to uh commend Senator Chanley and those
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill for this uh this
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
approach I won't repeat some of the uh
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
endorsements and information that we're
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
given already other than to say that uh
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
feel the same way in terms of what the
 
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
Senator's comments were in Mr Ramsey's
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
comments were but a couple of other uh
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
notes I think that the power in this and
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
again I think we'd all agree and those
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
that have given information on this
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
prior have said the same that it's not a
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
fix it's not a one it's it's not a uh
 
01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
one stroke that will fix everything but
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think it offers a good uh solution and
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in uh with some
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislators in Massachusetts on some
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
approaches that have tried to go into
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
the transaction and all kinds of things
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
that get super complicated I think the
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
power here is its simplicity
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it it focuses on the
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
education and the disclosure of what
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
that transaction is about so uh
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative and your uh your example
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
of your Barry Manilow tickets
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
applaud you for that uh that
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
um that at least you know at least you
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
would be aware that that you you then as
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
the consumer would have the choice of
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not you wanted to
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
um to make that purchase but fully
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
knowing that you're not buying from an
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
organization that is the primary seller
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if it's practical but to
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
go one step further it would be nice to
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
have the disclosure uh include
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
information on what the primary seller
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
is because these are real issues that we
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
um day in and day out a couple of uh
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
notes on
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
um the loss of income it is consumer
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
nightmare as Mr Ramsey noted but there
 
01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
are a couple of other things that go
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
directly into a direct loss of income
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
one is uh that it locks up inventory
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
that we would otherwise be getting uh
 
01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
revenue for I can give you an example uh
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
of tickets being sold on a secondary
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
Market site we found out about that
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
through our ticketing company refunded
 
01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
those uh original purchasers
 
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
um but those tickets were were uh
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
because it was they were transacted on a
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
stolen credit card those that bought on
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
the secondary market then showed up to
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
our sold out show we as the venue are
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
then a never going to get we either we
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
have a choice we can either never
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
realize that Revenue because now we've
 
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
canceled those tickets but we know those
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
people we don't know who those people
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
are that bought the ticket they're on
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
our way to their to our theater
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
um so we can either a just not resell
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
those tickets we've given the money back
 
01:40:06.649 --> 01:40:06.659 align:start position:0%
and and when those consumers show up put
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
them in their seats uh even though they
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
they've purchased fraudulent tickets or
 
01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:13.139 align:start position:0%
B resell those tickets which is our
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
contractual obligation to the artist uh
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
and then tell the people that showed up
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
that night that I'm sorry you purchased
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
tickets that were originally purchased
 
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
with a stolen credit card they would
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
have no way of knowing that so we are in
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
a terrible uh bind on that secondly in
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
terms of
um

01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
the ability of these secondary Market
 
01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
sites to promote themselves they do so
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
very effectively on Google AdWords and
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
other advertising platforms we spend a
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
significant thousands of dollars a year
 
01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
of our own uh for our own Google ads in
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
order to just be in the mix so that when
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
someone does search our ad shows up next
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
to theirs and we hope that they find
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
their way towards the primary seller so
 
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
we're just playing combat against their
 
01:40:58.610 --> 01:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
advertising with our advertising dollars
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
because as you probably all know the the
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
sponsored search in Google is going is
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
showing up before the organic search so
 
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a direct loss uh
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
there another comment on Vivid Seats if
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
you search Vivid Seats lawsuits instead
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
of just Vivid Seats you will see that
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
there have been class action suits by
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
both Pennsylvania and the United Kingdom
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
which is where that company is based uh
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is not a nice player in the
 
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:25.100 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh by any means and has been
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
had action against it on a number of uh
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
a number of occasions
 
01:41:33.169 --> 01:41:33.179 align:start position:0%
um and and a last comment on the
 
01:41:33.179 --> 01:41:34.310 align:start position:0%
um and and a last comment on the
enforcement

01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
um yes it's difficult
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
um but I think that that shouldn't stop
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
this uh this Committee in this body from
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
from pursuing this I think it is another
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
tool that allows us to forward the
 
01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
education of those that are purchasing
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
tickets and and allowing the consumer to
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
make the choice and I think again that's
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
where you've got uh something you're on
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
to something here and in its Simplicity
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
of just informing the consumer that they
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
are not buying from the primary and they
 
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
may be then uh because we run into this
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
all the time where people just didn't
 
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
know that they weren't buying from us we
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
try to do that we promote that whenever
 
01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
we have a show that goes on sale we have
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
language in each of those announcements
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
to uh tell people to go directly to our
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
sites and giving those addresses so that
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
we try to combat that as much as we can
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
but we're up against some powerful
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
adversaries who are trying to you know
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
work it the other way against us
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
um so that at least those that uh you
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
know we we hear time and time again from
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
consumers that are or they say well I
 
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
wish I knew it looked like your site I
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
did how was I to know uh or they'd go
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
through with the transaction and buy a
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
ticket for four or five times what it
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
was and they do buy it and then they get
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
angry at us for for selling it how can
 
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
you sell tickets at that much money it's
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
like well no it's a third of the price
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
if you had gone uh Gone directly to our
 
01:42:51.530 --> 01:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
website it is the information empowering
 
01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
the consumer with the information
 
01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
um is really the power of it and it
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
doesn't restrict the sale it doesn't try
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
to control the price and I've seen like
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
I said in Massachusetts there's some
 
01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
legislation being considered that is
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
getting way into the Weeds on pricing
 
01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
getting way into the Weeds on pricing
and

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:09.169 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth and that gets really
 
01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.850 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth and that gets really
complicated

01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
um this is uh empowers the consumer to
 
01:43:20.209 --> 01:43:20.219 align:start position:0%
know uh whether or not they are
 
01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:22.139 align:start position:0%
purchasing directly from the source and
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
that those uh organizations that are
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
taking the Financial Risk and uh the
 
01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
ones that own those tickets originally
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
and are contractually obligated via
 
01:43:33.169 --> 01:43:33.179 align:start position:0%
their contracts with producers and
 
01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:35.219 align:start position:0%
artists to Steward them in a certain way
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
so I applaud the approach uh again agree
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
that it's not a fix for everything but I
 
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
think it takes a very sensible approach
 
01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:45.659 align:start position:0%
to informing the consumer about a very
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:55.550 align:start position:0%
 
venues

01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
venues
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
venue are the venues the only um place
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
of where you can buy a ticket for the
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
venue or do contract with
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
other companies to help sell your ticket
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
we have a software licensing contract
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
with a ticketing system so we're the
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
ones who are selling the ticket we
 
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
control that transaction we're the
 
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
recipient of the funds when that and the
 
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
steward of those funds when those uh
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
when that transaction happens so we do
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
have a a software contract just like you
 
01:44:26.689 --> 01:44:26.699 align:start position:0%
know you'd license a word processor or
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
anything else but yes we are the seller
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
and and have full control of that
 
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
transaction that wouldn't be
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
Ticketmaster now would it be it is etix
 
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
it is not Ticketmaster so it's a
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
different one a similar similar yeah you
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
know there's many many different types

thank you Mr just quickly on uh line
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
nine page two
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
I just want to understand number three
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
there if if you could explain what that
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
means and and sure absolutely so
 
01:45:08.159 --> 01:45:10.250 align:start position:0%
means and and sure absolutely so
oftentimes

01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:11.090 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
um

01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
a reseller
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
will go on to when you go onto their
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
website you might see the opportunity to
 
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
buy a ticket in balcony section F and uh
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's no specifics on the the seat
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
beyond that General location and often
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
there's language in there that'll also
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
say well we're going to try to get you
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
section F we're not quite sure but if
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
you read really the fine print which is
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
nowhere near 14 point font that's often
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to get you a ticket
 
01:45:45.169 --> 01:45:45.179 align:start position:0%
we think we're going to get you balcony
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
section F and that's what we're selling
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
you what's happening is they don't own
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
the tickets the reseller doesn't own the
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
tickets at that point so they'll like
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're good at Marketing Online they
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
will get that consumer to transact
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
initially for three four x the base the
 
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
face ticket price
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh have that money in hand and then go
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
to our site and buy those tickets
 
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
because they know that we had a bunch of
 
01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
inventory left in a balcony section F
 
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
that they monitored so that they can
 
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
then buy from the primary send those
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
tickets to the consumer uh and and
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
what's called the lift retain the lift
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
the problem with that besides that you
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
know the ticket price is now 4X what it
 
01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
should have been is that we don't have
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
any relationship with that consumer we
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't know that that we just know it's
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
been sold on our system
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
we can often detect accounts that are
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
that are doing this but that's uh not
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
often easy but sometimes possible
 
01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so that transaction is now a step
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
removed and that consumer thinking they
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
bought from us actually bought uh from a
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
company that looked and and sounded a
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative purcelli then
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
represent post
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:08.699 align:start position:0%
on page two uh line one
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
I think there's a verb missing reselling
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
tickets to an event or performance
 
01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
seems to me like there's something
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
missing unless the seller accomplishes
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
the following
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
is my first question and then I have a
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
we will go through this in this
 
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so so it would be this
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
disclosure would be effective if we
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
could influence the websites actually
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
adhere to these disclosures so wouldn't
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
in your opinion would it be very
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
difficult to try to get these websites
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
that come and go to follow these very
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
specific system type requirements I
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be easy but I think
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:47:57.850 --> 01:47:57.860 align:start position:0%
it's worth I think that the the the
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
education piece is important the
 
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement piece is difficult but I
 
01:48:03.590 --> 01:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
also think that it wouldn't be just up
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
to the consumer to enforce I think that
 
01:48:07.609 --> 01:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
uh in our case we have three different
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
venues that we we have a relationship
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
with in this in this uh state two of
 
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
which we are the primary seller
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you know it may be up to us to have
 
01:48:18.590 --> 01:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know or or a group of us that are I
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
know that was the case in in um in
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania with a class action suited
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
was from the consumer side not the venue
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
side with with Vivid Seats that was
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
effective and settled
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
um so I don't I I think it's a long
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
battle I also think and and um have
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
shared this approach with
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Gordon in
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who is uh pursuing trying
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
to find a solution to have some uh some
 
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
teeth in in some of the the legislation
 
01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:45.659 align:start position:0%
being considered there I think it's got
 
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
to be you got to start somewhere and and
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
this is a huge problem for consumers
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's a huge problem for the the the Arts
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
industry and and for the live
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
entertainment industry
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's easy to get them
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
to do that but
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot harder if we don't have
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
the uh the legislation passed um and
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
there are domestic sites as well Vivid
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
Seats is one that's based in the UK but
 
01:49:07.729 --> 01:49:07.739 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other sites
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and there are a lot there are a
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
number of secondary sites that do try to
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
play by the StubHub is one that does
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
have a a better reputation than others
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
and has made an effort to follow
 
01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:18.350 align:start position:0%
and has made an effort to follow
different

01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.090 align:start position:0%
different
um

01:49:19.090 --> 01:49:19.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh different laws and regulations that
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
that they're uh subject to so I think
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
there is some there will be some
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
adoption by those that are trying to
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
play in the secondary Market space which
 
01:49:33.890 --> 01:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
is a multi-billion dollar industry
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and there are those players it's not
 
01:49:39.649 --> 01:49:39.659 align:start position:0%
all Vivid Seats it's not all fraud it is
 
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of legitimate companies taking
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of the
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
the pricing inefficiencies in the live
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
entertainment Market you've got a a an
 
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
industry that is different from most and
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
that we have fixed Supply so when you
 
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
have we can't add more seats we've got
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
the capacity that we have so the only
 
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
Flex in that is price when the demand
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
outstrips Supply so there's a lot of
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
companies that play in that secondary
 
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
space that do try to play by the rules
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
and I think that they would adopt this
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot that would be harder to
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
enforce that wouldn't but like I said I
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a sensible approach that that
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
um you know starts somewhere
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
and representative post
 
01:50:21.169 --> 01:50:21.179 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
monthly how many people come in that
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
have these fraudulent tickets it's hard
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
for us to track because there are many
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
occasions where someone will buy that
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
second ticket on the secondary Market
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
receive the ticket come to the
 
01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.649 align:start position:0%
receive the ticket come to the
performance

01:50:45.649 --> 01:50:45.659 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
um and never knew that they didn't buy
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
on the primary on the primary sale that
 
01:50:51.119 --> 01:50:51.890 align:start position:0%
on the primary on the primary sale that
they

01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
they paid x amount they went to the show
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
and and that was it
 
01:50:57.719 --> 01:50:58.609 align:start position:0%
and and that was it
um

01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:00.590 --> 01:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
they never had the opportunity to know
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
that they weren't or probably never knew
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
that they weren't buying from that
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
primary source or that they paid a
 
01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:09.659 align:start position:0%
significant amount over so we do track
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
it most of the time when we're when we
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
find out about it it's because there's
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
been uh our partner ticketing company
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
e-tix has a fraud department and often
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
they'll tell us hey we've seen
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
this account with these characteristics
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
be associated with some fraudulent
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
transactions heads up you should look
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
for a b or c or secondly we're dealing
 
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
with someone night of the show at the
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
box office that has uh an issue it's not
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
often that they're simply selling a
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
fraudulent ticket it's often that the
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
transaction itself was
 
01:51:45.119 --> 01:51:46.750 align:start position:0%
transaction itself was
um

01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
opaque in terms of of who they were
 
01:51:51.169 --> 01:51:51.179 align:start position:0%
buying from and meant to be it was a a
 
01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
transaction based on misrepresentation
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
of who they were buying from
 
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
so just follow up for the question so
 
01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:00.179 align:start position:0%
with that what you're saying is you lose
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
the money from the ticket if the people
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
don't come and say
 
01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:08.699 align:start position:0%
if you know well we received
 
01:52:12.169 --> 01:52:12.179 align:start position:0%
we will have received the funds from the
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
secondary market so we were made you
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
know we we would have received they
 
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
would have bought that ticket
 
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
um where we run into problems is if that
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
ticket we had an issue where a number of
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
years ago where
 
01:52:26.219 --> 01:52:26.810 align:start position:0%
years ago where
um

01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
tickets were being purchased with with
 
01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
stolen credit cards
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
um so that and then being dumped into
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
secondary market sales platforms at half
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
price because they weren't paying for
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
the ticket in the first place 50 is
 
01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
better than nothing and it's all so that
 
01:52:44.689 --> 01:52:44.699 align:start position:0%
what we ended up with was
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
people's whose credit cards were stolen
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
initiated a charge back with the credit
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
card company so we lost the money in
 
01:52:52.250 --> 01:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
that case
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and then the consumer showed up with
 
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
a ticket that was canceled so in in that
 
01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
case that was earlier I was describing
 
01:53:00.169 --> 01:53:00.179 align:start position:0%
the kind of that a b scenario do we just
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
deny the consumer when they show up at
 
01:53:03.649 --> 01:53:03.659 align:start position:0%
the door do we lose the money
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
so often most of the times we are
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
receiving what we put the ticket on sale
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
for the lift so the the three four x the
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
The Base ticket price that uh was paid
 
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
we don't participate in that's a whole
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
other and I think that's kind of the the
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
some of the power in in of this approach
 
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
is that it isn't focusing on that lift
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's a whole other
 
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
um a whole other ball of wax that that
 
01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
gets you know extremely complicated I
 
01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:34.070 align:start position:0%
gets you know extremely complicated I
think

01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
but just the disclosure piece of saying
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
consumer you are not buying from the
 
01:53:41.450 --> 01:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
original source of this even though you
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
may think you are so there's just no
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
there the best they that the secondary
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
markets can do is look to represent
 
01:53:49.729 --> 01:53:49.739 align:start position:0%
themselves as closely to a primary
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
ticket sale uh sale as they can
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and being able to disclose and inform
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
the public that that's not the
 
01:53:58.450 --> 01:53:58.460 align:start position:0%
transaction they're about to enter into
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh I think is the is a powerful approach
 
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks again I have
 
01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
one more card left Salvador pizio from
 
01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everybody I would say
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
good morning but we're past that point
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
now so uh my name is Sal purzio with the
 
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
capital Center for the Arts uh I am
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
going to be very brief today because my
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
two colleagues did a fantastic job
 
01:54:30.169 --> 01:54:30.179 align:start position:0%
outlining some of the issues that have
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
been presented before you today
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
um I will highlight though that the
 
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
capital Center this year alone and I'm
 
01:54:39.169 --> 01:54:39.179 align:start position:0%
talking about from September through now
 
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
has lost almost twenty thousand dollars
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
in ticket sales as a result of we were
 
01:54:46.729 --> 01:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
victim this year of the credit card uh
 
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
scams that have been going on uh stolen
 
01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:50.219 align:start position:0%
credit cards are used to purchase
 
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
tickets for events and much like was
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
said before the consumer came to our
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
venue looking for those seats but we had
 
01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
no idea that those people were even
 
01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
purchase tickets from us because those
 
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
tickets had already been refunded by the
 
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
credit card company because they were
 
01:55:09.410 --> 01:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
fraudulent purchases so a we were out
 
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
the money from those tickets unless we
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
were informed far enough in advance to
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
resell them and then B we have a whole
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
host of people coming to our spaces
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
screaming in our faces that they spent
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
three four hundred dollars for tickets
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
and they're only recourses to go back to
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
Vivid Seats and or other ticket
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
companies and try to get their refunds
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
from them
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
we have reached out to these companies
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
time and time again with no results
 
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
we've asked them to at least disclose to
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
us who the people were that bought the
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
fraudulent tickets so that we could try
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
to reach out to them again directly and
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
try to make some sort of recourse even
 
01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
though it's not our responsibility to do
 
01:55:49.930 --> 01:55:49.940 align:start position:0%
so but it is our reputations on the line
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
so that is one of the specific examples
 
01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
I wanted to highlight to this committee
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
here the other two points I really
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure and this is a bit of
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
a kind of an education on a piece of our
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
business here is when we book a show
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
part of that contract is specifically
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
designed in that contract there were
 
01:56:11.209 --> 01:56:11.219 align:start position:0%
specific language in there that says we
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
are licensing the tickets from the
 
01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
musician or the artist or whoever these
 
01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:19.340 align:start position:0%
are the specific contract stated prices
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
the number of tickets that can be sold
 
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
at each individual price so when I see
 
01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
third-party sites going and doing this
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it's a violation of that
 
01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:30.659 align:start position:0%
contract of which they're not party to
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
but still it's a direct violation of
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
that contract the other thing I think is
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to know for this
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
this body and in general this is the
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
education we're trying to tell people is
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
when you buy a ticket it's a seat
 
01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
license it's not a piece of property so
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
much like I heard in our in my Senate
 
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
testimony somebody had countered with
 
01:56:52.189 --> 01:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
well if I buy a car I can turn around
 
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
and sell it on the used car market for
 
01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
wherever I want
 
01:56:57.290 --> 01:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
a car is your personal piece of property
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
when you buy a ticket to a show you're
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
essentially buying the right to go sit
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
for that per certain period of time and
 
01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
listen to that artist's intellectual
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
property a more accurate comparison
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be I paid for Netflix so I'm going
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
to go down the street to the movie
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
theater and show Netflix movies and
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
charge people for it that's a more
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
accurate representation of what you're
 
01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
doing when you buy a ticket and then
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
turn around and sell it on the third
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
party Market
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's always gonna there's always going
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
to be the guy outside of the the venue
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
holding you know with the trench coat
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
maybe not a trench coat maybe it's a
 
01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
windbreaker whatever selling tickets
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is a much more sophisticated
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
operation and like was said before it's
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
become a multi-billion dollar operation
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
um and it's affecting us it's I mean
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
when you when you want you asked uh
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
earlier how often is this happening we
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
are getting this at every single show
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
now somebody's showing up that spent two
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
three four hundred dollars for tickets
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
that were fifty sixty dollars
 
01:57:54.659 --> 01:57:56.030 align:start position:0%
that were fifty sixty dollars
so

01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
they are to the points that they were
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
saying before they're spending money on
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
Google ads we get the non-for-profit
 
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
Google megaphone thing that tries to
 
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
compete with it but we're a small
 
01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
non-for-profit in Concord New Hampshire
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
I can't compete on an advertising scale
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
with Vivid Seats in StubHub they're
 
01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.139 align:start position:0%
spending multi-million dollars to buy
 
01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
Google ads that outpace us so if you
 
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
were to look at if you were to Google
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
right now Marshall Tucker Band Capital
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
Center for the Arts I guarantee you
 
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
Vivid Seats etix StubHub are going to be
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
in the mix with us right there sometimes
 
01:58:32.089 --> 01:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
we show up number one sometimes we don't
 
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
but the problem is is the consumer pays
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
for it and then we pay for it and lost
 
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.910 align:start position:0%
for it and then we pay for it and lost
Revenue

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
so those are that's uh what everything
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
else was pretty well said by my
 
01:58:43.129 --> 01:58:43.139 align:start position:0%
colleagues so I don't want to keep
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
reiterating the same points but I'm
 
01:58:45.709 --> 01:58:45.719 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions I
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate them representative
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:58:52.810 --> 01:58:52.820 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question and
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
before every performance is there an
 
01:58:59.330 --> 01:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity for yourself or somebody
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
else that works at the Capitol to
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
explain or you know do a a justice so
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
not all yeah we have the language on our
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
website and every time I do a Curtain
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
Speech I literally say to the audience
 
01:59:17.810 --> 01:59:17.820 align:start position:0%
please buy your tickets from ccanh.com
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
because I can guarantee the price and I
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
can guarantee the ticket's real if you
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
buy it from anybody else I can't
 
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.050 --> 01:59:29.060 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
taking our questions and of course
 
01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
realize we're going pretty long here
 
01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:35.810 align:start position:0%
realize we're going pretty long here
um

01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
I just I'm curious from the your
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
business perspective if these other
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
third-party ticket sellers are a benefit
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
to your business do are you putting
 
01:59:48.189 --> 01:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
butts in seats that you might otherwise
 
01:59:51.649 --> 01:59:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh would not have if it weren't for this
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
extended advertising reach of these
 
01:59:55.970 --> 01:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
third-party uh ticket sellers no because
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
I they're not advertising on your
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
traditional media like social media or
 
02:00:01.250 --> 02:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
anything like that what they're doing is
 
02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
they're just paying Google ads to get
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
when you do a search ad so it's not
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
anything that's increasing our
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
attendance in fact I would say the
 
02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
opposite I think they're parasitic to
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
our right it goes back to the question
 
02:00:16.010 --> 02:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
that representative Gibbs in terms of
 
02:00:19.070 --> 02:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
the hotels yeah you know uh you know
 
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
when I stay at a hotel I I know which ho
 
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
what the I know I have to keep going
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
down the list till I find the actual
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
properties email address absolutely
 
02:00:31.129 --> 02:00:31.139 align:start position:0%
because uh their actual you know the web
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
page because because bookings is always
 
02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
a top yeah but this is always going to
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
be and the other ones are always going
 
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
to be a top and hotels.com whatever so
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
you gotta you gotta you gotta be patient
 
02:00:44.209 --> 02:00:44.219 align:start position:0%
and go down the list and uh it used to
 
02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
be nice they used to have a line Google
 
02:00:47.209 --> 02:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
used to have a line yeah it was above
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
and then they got rid of it because they
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
make money on it too I mean I can tell
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
you right now if you you can actually go
 
02:00:55.129 --> 02:00:55.139 align:start position:0%
on Ticketmaster and buy tickets to
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
events at the capital Center we're not a
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
Ticketmaster venue and they call it the
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
reselling tickets location but what they
 
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
do is that same thing they use Bots to
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
figure out on our ticketing platform
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
what seats are available they don't even
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
buy them and if somebody wants to buy a
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
ticket through them then that bot will
 
02:01:13.490 --> 02:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
go and buy the ticket through us
 
02:01:15.410 --> 02:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
and the thing I think the important
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
thing to take away from all this too is
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
that again we enter into a contract with
 
02:01:21.169 --> 02:01:21.179 align:start position:0%
an artist
 
02:01:23.689 --> 02:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
and any of those markups any of the lift
 
02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
that was said before the artist is not
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
participating in any of that and we have
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
specific lifts for VIP and all that sort
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
of stuff because people are paying to
 
02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
see intellectual property in person and
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
if they're not participating in any of
 
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
that additional Revenue then it's a loss
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
to them and a loss to us who put out the
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
guarantees and the we take all the risk
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
when we have an artist come into a space
 
02:01:49.129 --> 02:01:49.139 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a double whammy for us now
 
02:01:50.810 --> 02:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
look I don't think this I think this
 
02:01:52.850 --> 02:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
bill is on the 20 yard line as far as we
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
were where we need to go as an industry
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
um but it's a great first step in
 
02:01:59.930 --> 02:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
educating the the consumer that you're
 
02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
not buying from us
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
so we this bill will go to a
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and you've given me a great
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
idea for the solution to your problem so
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
we'll take it off then thank you I
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate all your time thank you very
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
much all right so we've closed the
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
public hearing finally on 201 uh I can
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
see uh uh nobody signed the blue sheet
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
and on online we had five in support
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
three of which were co-sponsors and two
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
people opposed I'm close to hearing and
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming this next one is going
 
02:02:33.609 --> 02:02:33.619 align:start position:0%
to be a quickie so I think we're gonna
 
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go we're going forward with
 
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.699 --> 02:02:47.830 align:start position:0%

federal law to bring parity to fhlbs for

02:04:21.169 --> 02:04:21.179 align:start position:0%
this bill ensures that insurance
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
companies are treated similar to
 
02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:26.219 align:start position:0%
depository institutions thus allowing
 
02:04:28.609 --> 02:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
them to borrow at the cheapest possible
 
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:31.260 align:start position:0%

I will defer questions to the industry

experts here in support of Senate Bill
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
66 but if you do have specific questions
 
02:04:47.570 --> 02:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
for Senator Gannon I can make sure he
 
02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
gets you an answer
 
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Gannon thanks you for your

02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
ironically I had a fairly well time for
 
02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
the two bills but then this bill got
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
lost in the in the Hinterlands of the
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
computer world and if it wasn't for
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
meeting you guys in the hallway we might
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
never have gotten it scheduled so I went
 
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
chased it down and that's why I snuck it
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
in here but obviously
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
um the sneaky end didn't work as well as
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
I would have liked
 
02:05:26.159 --> 02:05:32.030 align:start position:0%

we're government-sponsored Enterprises

and and cooperatively owned meaning
 
02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
we're owned by our members those banks
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
credit unions and insurance companies
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we only do business with our members

we're wholesale Banks we don't we don't
 
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
lend to individuals and consumers we

insurance companies
 
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
to access our liquidity members pledge
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
collateral by Statute by federal statute
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're only able to lend on a secured
 
02:07:01.609 --> 02:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
basis and that collateral is typically
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
in the form of mortgage loans and
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
the home loan Banks because we're
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
government-sponsored Enterprises are

terms and we pass that benefit on to our
 
02:07:23.089 --> 02:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
members by making low-cost loans to them
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
um that's government-sponsored
 
02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
Enterprise status also means we can
 
02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
access funds in the global Capital

banking crisis where two two
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
high-profile bank failures created some

instability in the banking industry and
 
02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
the Home Loan Bank stepped up by raising
 
02:07:46.370 --> 02:07:46.380 align:start position:0%

in this region
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
we set aside at least 10 percent of our

we have a program called jobs for New

England that makes subsidized loans
 
02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
available to our bank and credit union
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
members that they can in turn make loans
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
to small businesses in New England to
 
02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
create or preserve jobs in the region
 
02:08:27.709 --> 02:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
and in 2023 we'll launch a special
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
purpose credit program that will provide
 
02:08:32.689 --> 02:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
down payment assistance to people of

02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
so with all that as background about the

so with all that as background about the
bank

02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
bank
 
02:08:42.770 --> 02:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
the specifics in sb66 says Miss Hardy
 
02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
alluded to are designed to create parity
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
between federal laws applicable to your
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
your New Hampshire Banks and credit
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
unions and state insurance laws which
 
02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
apply to the New Hampshire insurance
 
02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:56.330 align:start position:0%
apply to the New Hampshire insurance
companies

02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
under Federal banking laws the home loan
 
02:09:01.729 --> 02:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
bank is afforded protections that enable
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
that that don't make us subject to a
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
state period or any claw back risk with
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
respect to our collateral if a bank or
 
02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
credit union were to fail
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
we do not have similar protections under
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Insurance code and and
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what SB 66 would be
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
designed to introduce them to the
 
02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:20.099 align:start position:0%
insurance code
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
although the subject matter of sb66 is
 
02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
an insurance company receivership there
 
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that as far as I'm aware
 
02:09:29.209 --> 02:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
there's no imminent risk to the
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
insurance industry in New Hampshire or
 
02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in New England
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
instead sb66 admittedly addresses an
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
extremely rare what-if scenario
 
02:09:39.890 --> 02:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
but as a heavily regulated financial
 
02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
institution the the home loan bank is
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
expected to plan for those exceedingly
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
rare what-if scenarios
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
and the certainty provide provided by SB
 
02:09:53.089 --> 02:09:53.099 align:start position:0%
66 to the home loan Banks does just that
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
by ensuring that we could continue to
 
02:09:58.010 --> 02:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
provide liquidity to our insurance
 
02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
company members in New Hampshire right
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
up to the point of receivership and and
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
not have to have concerns about the
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
availability of our collateral
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that similar legislation
 
02:10:13.490 --> 02:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
has become law already in 24 States
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're pursuing similar Legislation
 
02:10:18.109 --> 02:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
during this legislative session in both
 
02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont
 
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
um resource constraints alone we might
 
02:10:24.890 --> 02:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
have been in all six New England states
 
02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
this session and and we'll probably be
 
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
in those other three next year
 
02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
so in closing I thank the committee for
 
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
their consideration of the bill and
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
stand by for any questions you may have
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
um hopefully you have a copy of your
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
testimony because the clerk would I I
 
02:10:44.089 --> 02:10:44.099 align:start position:0%
think I handed it to them okay great
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
making its way around yep
 
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah just make sure I understand
 
02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between the
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve
 
02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
and and you guys are you part do you get
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
your money from the Federal Reserve also
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
or are you we're not the government uh
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
the federal home loan Banks um our our
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
government-sponsored Enterprises who are
 
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
who are member owned so we're privately
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
owned and and we're owned by our members
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
who are the banks credit unions and
 
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
insurance companies so we are privately
 
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
held institutions not the federal
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
government so are you owned by other
 
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
Banks or owned by we're owned by the
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
bank's credit unions and insurance
 
02:11:24.169 --> 02:11:24.179 align:start position:0%
companies in New England okay we
 
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
currently have 427 banks credit unions
 
02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
and insurance companies that are our
 
02:11:29.099 --> 02:11:30.530 align:start position:0%
and insurance companies that are our
shareholders

02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
shareholders
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay all right good question all right
 
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Terry thank you
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
so um if you've since you've been in
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
existence since 1932 and it sounds like
 
02:11:43.370 --> 02:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
the structure the members have been
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
in place since 1932 that is the banks
 
02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
the credit unions and the insurance
 
02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:49.010 align:start position:0%
the credit unions and the insurance
companies

02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
why now with respect to this particular
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
issue as opposed to 10 20 30 or 40 50
 
02:11:57.169 --> 02:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
good question and the I would say
 
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
although insurance companies have been
 
02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
eligible eligible to be members of the
 
02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
Home Loan Bank since 1932 only about in
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
the 90s early 2000s did we really see an
 
02:12:11.570 --> 02:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
uptick in insurance company membership
 
02:12:14.089 --> 02:12:14.099 align:start position:0%
and with that uptick in in membership
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
our regulator became focused on the
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
disparities between how we how we how
 
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
the law treats our business with our
 
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
insurance company members and how the
 
02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
law treats our business with banks and
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
credit unions and I think that those 24
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
states that have passed this legislation
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
in 2010 that might have been one or two
 
02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
this has really been an effort over the
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
last decade
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
um to pass this similar legislation and
 
02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
all of the the states uh in in the
 
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
United States and
 
02:12:48.050 --> 02:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
we're making some Headway another
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
question just to be clear the
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility has been in place since 1932
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
but it's been more recently than
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have uh a greater
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
involvement and that's why this issue
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
has emerged correct thank you got it
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay representation
 
02:13:09.649 --> 02:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
02:13:11.209 --> 02:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
testimony and taking questions my
 
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
pleasure uh in in the previous uh
 
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
presenter uh Miss Harvey she used the
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
term that I'm not familiar with I
 
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
thought maybe I'd ask you
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
um it's stays and voidable transfers uh
 
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be significant in what
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here if you could
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
just explain that correct so uh stay
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
think of it um another term you might
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
see used in in certain States laws it's
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
like an injunction so a stay would mean
 
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
if an insurance company in New Hampshire
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
entered a receivership they'd basically
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
be a pens down everyone Full Stop on
 
02:13:44.209 --> 02:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
exercising your rights as to that
 
02:13:45.890 --> 02:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
insurance company whether it's a
 
02:13:48.649 --> 02:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
policyholder a secured creditor like the
 
02:13:48.659 --> 02:13:50.089 align:start position:0%
policyholder a secured creditor like the
bank

02:13:50.089 --> 02:13:50.099 align:start position:0%
bank
 
02:13:52.250 --> 02:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
um or any other creditor
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a corollary in
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
federal bankruptcy law called the
 
02:13:57.649 --> 02:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
automatic stay so I think that's why
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
it's it's often referred to that the
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
avoidable preference I would put those
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
broadly in the category of clawback risk
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh the risk is that once a a company
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
enters receivership or bankruptcy it's
 
02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
the risk to you as a as a secured
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
creditor that somebody's going to come
 
02:14:16.250 --> 02:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
back try to claw back your collateral
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
you're interested in that in that
 
02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
collateral those are the two points that
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
are being addressed by SB 66 with
 
02:14:25.129 --> 02:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
respect to New Hampshire insurance
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
companies and for which the banks the
 
02:14:28.609 --> 02:14:28.619 align:start position:0%
federal home loan Banks already have
 
02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
ironically the only Bank we've insurance
 
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
company we've ever had was actually
 
02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much thanks
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.890 --> 02:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.450 --> 02:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Doug Bartlett I'm the
 
02:14:58.129 --> 02:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
director of financial regulations for
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:15:05.569 --> 02:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
just I'm here to say that we uh in
 
02:15:07.129 --> 02:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
we have 10 insurers that actually use
 
02:15:10.079 --> 02:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
we have 10 insurers that actually use
this

02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and and I didn't hear Keith
 
02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
say this maybe he did but they they buy
 
02:15:17.219 --> 02:15:18.649 align:start position:0%
say this maybe he did but they they buy
stock

02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
stock
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
in the home loan bank and that and and
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
so these 10 companies that buy stock are
 
02:15:30.649 --> 02:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
eligible to uh to borrow money
 
02:15:30.659 --> 02:15:31.729 align:start position:0%
eligible to uh to borrow money
um

02:15:31.729 --> 02:15:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:34.609 --> 02:15:34.619 align:start position:0%
we only have one company that has
 
02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
actually borrowed money that still owes
 
02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:37.609 align:start position:0%
actually borrowed money that still owes
some

02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh and and like he says it's a liquidity
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
thing we had a one of our companies that
 
02:15:46.490 --> 02:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
wrote Federal crop insurance
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
and you know by the time they get the
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
premium it's like a year and a half
 
02:15:53.089 --> 02:15:53.099 align:start position:0%
after they wrote the policy and they uh
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
they did use it uh to um for liquidity
 
02:15:59.390 --> 02:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
that company was bought by AIG and they
 
02:16:01.490 --> 02:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
don't use it anymore but uh so those
 
02:16:04.129 --> 02:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
those are the two instances I know that
 
02:16:04.139 --> 02:16:05.030 align:start position:0%
those are the two instances I know that
uh

02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire companies have actually
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
borrowed but it is some large lines of
 
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
credit there are three Liberty companies
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:21.530 --> 02:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
what I'd call capacity to borrow if they
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
levels the playing field for the
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
insurance companies yeah close to okay
 
02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
any questions then okay
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative so the department I I
 
02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
take it the department does not have any
 
02:16:43.009 --> 02:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill and you're fully
 
02:16:46.310 --> 02:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
in support of it yes you're fine yes
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay up to this point though there have
 
02:16:56.169 --> 02:16:56.179 align:start position:0%

03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%

something so we're all right okay
 
03:36:08.510 --> 03:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:36:11.809 --> 03:36:11.819 align:start position:0%
uh Sun pill 37 establishing commissioned
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
to study hospitality and tourism
 
03:36:17.330 --> 03:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:22.370 --> 03:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I do have a comment on this
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
one if I may okay thank you
 
03:36:31.729 --> 03:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
um uh there's a list of uh proposed
 
03:36:34.670 --> 03:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
um members of the commission yep and it
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it would be useful to
 
03:36:39.170 --> 03:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
add someone who is a worker in the
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't think very many of them are
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
unionized so I don't know that we could
 
03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
go about it that way although I'd be
 
03:36:49.250 --> 03:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
perfectly comfortable who who what
 
03:36:51.530 --> 03:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
Association do they have to get them
 
03:36:55.610 --> 03:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
appointed uh I don't know but I think it
 
03:36:57.530 --> 03:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
would be worth finding out and including
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
03:37:02.050 --> 03:37:02.060 align:start position:0%
um the amendment could start with just a
 
03:37:05.389 --> 03:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative or or simply a worker in
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
the hospitality industry and then the
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission could find out
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
um uh who to get a recommendation from
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
however if you would like I will inquire
 
03:37:20.889 --> 03:37:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:24.769 --> 03:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
uh okay you can inquire
 
03:37:27.050 --> 03:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
um we don't I mean I this is just a
 
03:37:29.210 --> 03:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
study commission other than that adding
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
a member I don't know any more than that
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
but I I'm sorry I couldn't hear you I'm
 
03:37:35.330 --> 03:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
just saying just it's only a study
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
commission so uh that would be the only
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
amendment you know otherwise in terms of
 
03:37:44.450 --> 03:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
having the subcommittee we're not we
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
have any strong opinions when
 
03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:47.870 align:start position:0%
have any strong opinions when
representative

03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:49.130 align:start position:0%
representative
Commission

03:37:49.130 --> 03:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
you're on the study yeah
 
03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the alcohol tourism Commission
 
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
right a long time ago right no I was
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
saying yeah you did talk about the study
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:04.490 --> 03:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
this is a commission this is not a study
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee you're on a special committee
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah that is studying the commissions or
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.809 --> 03:38:17.819 align:start position:0%
it is I that's why I asked him okay if
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
he would be willing to be on this and
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
you know be the first member and he said
 
03:38:21.479 --> 03:38:22.309 align:start position:0%
you know be the first member and he said
yes

03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
so it meets the criteria yeah so I'm
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay with an OTP on this
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's needed it's not a big
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a big Rule and I think it's I
 
03:38:32.690 --> 03:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
think it's good I think they can all get
 
03:38:34.490 --> 03:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
together with having
 
03:38:36.889 --> 03:38:36.899 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission
 
03:38:40.130 --> 03:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
right I'm curious why we need it if UNH
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
has a thing that apparently the Senate
 
03:38:46.250 --> 03:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:47.570 --> 03:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean UNH already has a
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:55.849 --> 03:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
yeah he's a professor there okay I want
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
to do it I mean but UNH has a program on
 
03:39:00.769 --> 03:39:00.779 align:start position:0%
this I don't get why we need a committee
 
03:39:02.690 --> 03:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
on how to educate people when UNH
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
supposedly is doing it and
 
03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
maybe just needs to market the program
 
03:39:05.939 --> 03:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
maybe just needs to market the program
better

03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
I mean I I'm generally supportive of
 
03:39:13.969 --> 03:39:13.979 align:start position:0%
study committee so if we want to do it
 
03:39:15.170 --> 03:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
that's fine I'm not saying there's a big
 
03:39:18.110 --> 03:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
cost if we pass it but I'm I'm I was I
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.410 --> 03:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:30.290 --> 03:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
I mean it's just you know all right Mr
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah can I speak on this please

on the Alcohol tourism Commission

and uh we got a lot done but we never
 
03:39:50.090 --> 03:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
had a final report
 
03:39:52.729 --> 03:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
um what it says no we never did was that
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%

for directional because there was a yeah
 
03:40:06.410 --> 03:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
that was Transportation had a rule
 
03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:08.520 align:start position:0%

03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
community colleges and universities take
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
a look at the curriculum that's all it
 
03:40:30.050 --> 03:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
says and make sure that they are
 
03:40:33.410 --> 03:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
doing programs which do focus on tourism
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
that's all it says
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.359 --> 03:40:42.490 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:40:42.490 --> 03:40:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.809 --> 03:40:44.819 align:start position:0%
somebody thought it was important to
 
03:40:46.570 --> 03:40:46.580 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on the tourism stuff in college
 
03:40:52.729 --> 03:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
because tourism is big bucks for the
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire yeah but that's a
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
cricket that's a college curriculum
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
issue there is one it might and there
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
was one in UNH I mean my son went to
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
Denver University of Denver and they had
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
it had a Hospitality program and
 
03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna make an itl motion
 
03:41:15.960 --> 03:41:17.330 align:start position:0%
so you're gonna make an itl motion
okay

03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:22.370 --> 03:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:32.690 --> 03:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor say aye
 
03:41:38.269 --> 03:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
me two three four five six
 
03:41:40.969 --> 03:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman so if it's going to be
 
03:41:44.330 --> 03:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
IPL then my in my proposal to inquire is
 
03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
pointless that is true and
 
03:41:49.190 --> 03:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
but we did write that you thought it was
 
03:41:52.370 --> 03:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
lacking that position yes but if we're
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
not going to deposit then I won't bother
 
03:41:58.190 --> 03:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
inquiring yeah that's a good point good
 
03:41:58.200 --> 03:41:59.750 align:start position:0%
inquiring yeah that's a good point good
idea

03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
idea
 
03:41:59.760 --> 03:42:00.950 align:start position:0%
idea
okay

03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
all right last but not least relative to
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
product labeling and information guide
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for cannabis products and
 
03:42:09.889 --> 03:42:09.899 align:start position:0%
prohibition of the sale of hemp products
 
03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
containing certain levels of THC uh so
 
03:42:15.889 --> 03:42:15.899 align:start position:0%
the only thing I see is we need we need
 
03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:19.070 align:start position:0%
an amendment
Chris

03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
Dean uh we're going to need an amendment
 
03:42:25.010 --> 03:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh to make it point three
 
03:42:25.020 --> 03:42:26.710 align:start position:0%
uh to make it point three
yeah

03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:42:29.570 --> 03:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
Speak now or forevermore hold your peace
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.729 --> 03:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
in terms of in terms of the Liquor
 
03:42:36.889 --> 03:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
Commission that um that you know their
 
03:42:38.929 --> 03:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
job is to enforce the law and obviously
 
03:42:40.969 --> 03:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
they're already in there
 
03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
 
03:42:42.840 --> 03:42:44.290 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
um

03:42:44.290 --> 03:42:44.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
who so right now the Liquor Commission
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't regulate like uh other stores
 
03:42:52.490 --> 03:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
that sell like CBD stores so if they're
 
03:42:53.929 --> 03:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
selling these things as well who will
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
regulate that because that seems like an
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
obvious loophole in this law
 
03:42:57.720 --> 03:43:00.010 align:start position:0%
obvious loophole in this law
um

03:43:00.010 --> 03:43:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
commission does go into
 
03:43:04.130 --> 03:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
most of the stores that sell
 
03:43:04.140 --> 03:43:05.150 align:start position:0%
most of the stores that sell
s

03:43:05.150 --> 03:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
s
 
03:43:07.729 --> 03:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
right okay if they sell tobacco or
 
03:43:11.150 --> 03:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
vaping equipment so if they only sold
 
03:43:14.150 --> 03:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
just CBD
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
they don't go in there I don't know if
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
those stores exist but they do it seems
 
03:43:19.370 --> 03:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
like an obvious loophole that would be a
 
03:43:25.130 --> 03:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
well good luck I do remember the first
 
03:43:31.610 --> 03:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
time I saw a CBD was I was at tandy's
 
03:43:34.250 --> 03:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
and the woman across there and she said
 
03:43:38.450 --> 03:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
it was a beauty beauticians salon and
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
she had a CBD sign in the window
 
03:43:41.880 --> 03:43:43.429 align:start position:0%
she had a CBD sign in the window
yeah

03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:43:45.769 --> 03:43:45.779 align:start position:0%
and they would sell CBD
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
so like are there is there one of those
 
03:43:49.370 --> 03:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
in the state or is there a hundred of
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
those I don't think I know but I I don't
 
03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
even know I don't even know if she's
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
still in business but I remember whether
 
03:43:57.710 --> 03:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're I mean terms of those type of
 
03:44:00.530 --> 03:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
people who are selling CBD
 
03:44:01.969 --> 03:44:01.979 align:start position:0%
um they're going to be more
 
03:44:05.450 --> 03:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's a health conscious type item so so
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't think they're
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
going to be into into Delta this Delta
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
thing is more more of a uh
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh what I would call an off-premise
 
03:44:14.880 --> 03:44:15.969 align:start position:0%
uh what I would call an off-premise
licensee

03:44:15.969 --> 03:44:15.979 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
03:44:18.170 --> 03:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you think that the
 
03:44:20.510 --> 03:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
people who are in CBD aren't probably
 
03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
selling these cartridges that we're
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that what you're
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying right right but yeah but if they
 
03:44:30.410 --> 03:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
were then that you know law enforcement
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
in that Community could
 
03:44:35.929 --> 03:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
charge them to or get them to shut it
 
03:44:35.939 --> 03:44:39.110 align:start position:0%
charge them to or get them to shut it
down

03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
so if somebody discovered it then it
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
happened I mean it's the old classic
 
03:44:46.370 --> 03:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
somebody drop a dime on them right right
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure you think if there's another
 
03:44:50.570 --> 03:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sure those atcs will drop dimes on
 
03:44:52.809 --> 03:44:52.819 align:start position:0%
people if they see
 
03:44:57.710 --> 03:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.720 --> 03:45:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:04.010 --> 03:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative walls thank you
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:15.290 --> 03:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:17.450 --> 03:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
is the does the Liquor Commission need
 
03:45:20.929 --> 03:45:20.939 align:start position:0%
to be trained as to specifically what
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
products are going to be
 
03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
null you know not prohibited
 
03:45:30.290 --> 03:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
and can and against current resources
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
I I I would say they'll have to get up
 
03:45:39.290 --> 03:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
to speed yeah
 
03:45:42.290 --> 03:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
so for the question further question
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
so when this gets passed uh
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
in The Liquor Commission agents go into
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
convenience stores of which there are
 
03:45:55.130 --> 03:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
many and find these products do they
 
03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
confiscate them
 
03:46:01.550 --> 03:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know or uh because if you're relying
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
upon the the
 
03:46:06.050 --> 03:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
convenience store people to do it I
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
doubt they will be like they would come
 
03:46:10.010 --> 03:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
in and tell the store to get it off the
 
03:46:10.020 --> 03:46:12.110 align:start position:0%
in and tell the store to get it off the
shelf

03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
shelf
 
03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
so it's not really
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
being destroyed or one of my favorite
 
03:46:18.410 --> 03:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
stories about my visits to the Liquor
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
Commission office every once in a while
 
03:46:22.990 --> 03:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
it was at one point in time
 
03:46:25.670 --> 03:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
video poker machine sitting in the back
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
room and I go oh what's that doing here
 
03:46:33.290 --> 03:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
he says well
 
03:46:36.290 --> 03:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're illegal and
 
03:46:38.510 --> 03:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
he they found it was in Manchester you
 
03:46:40.729 --> 03:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
know it was a you know situation but he
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
goes Nobody everybody looked at each
 
03:46:44.450 --> 03:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
other who whose job is it to get rid of
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
and so the commission took it and it sat
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
there I assume they finally destroyed it
 
03:46:54.410 --> 03:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
at some point but but
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
um and They confiscated everybody sold
 
03:46:58.809 --> 03:46:58.819 align:start position:0%
them on eBay
 
03:47:05.330 --> 03:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
I I I would assume and knowing the
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission and I'm sure Aiden's
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
listening in and uh he you can you can
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
text me Aiden is um
 
03:47:21.050 --> 03:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
that there uh
 
03:47:24.410 --> 03:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
part of their mission is to educate so
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
yes that it once we were to pass the
 
03:47:30.469 --> 03:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
statute that day would be
 
03:47:33.170 --> 03:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
aware of it and they would be that if
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
they go into these stores and see it but
 
03:47:38.330 --> 03:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
the you have to know that the what
 
03:47:40.490 --> 03:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
really drives a lot of the stuff is
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
someone dropping a dime another rich
 
03:47:45.769 --> 03:47:45.779 align:start position:0%
said that you you go into a store or I
 
03:47:49.849 --> 03:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
go into a store and I see this and say
 
03:47:52.610 --> 03:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
you know you get you can't sell this so
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
should there be additional
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
um verbiage on this that says that the
 
03:48:02.150 --> 03:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission will
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
see to it that the product is
 
03:48:07.250 --> 03:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
confiscated and or destroyed I would
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
have to I'd have to find out from them
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they can just sell it
 
03:48:16.070 --> 03:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know with as as our vice chair said
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
You know open up this
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
trench coat and say Hey you know that's
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
a good that we consider the illegal
 
03:48:25.790 --> 03:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
Market yes well yes it would become
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
they're not selling it behind the Jack
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
they would be hanging out but
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
um well I remember in the when this
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
whole spice thing went down and yeah
 
03:48:37.250 --> 03:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of them there was a
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
behind the Shelf under the counter
 
03:48:42.170 --> 03:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
type issue and
 
03:48:45.050 --> 03:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of so that you beg the
 
03:48:46.910 --> 03:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
question if they really solved it is are
 
03:48:48.530 --> 03:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
there still some
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensees uh potentially
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
so who knows but but this goes back to
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
Keith's issue is why why pass the law
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
against something if you really can't
 
03:49:07.849 --> 03:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
truly make enforce it and the argument
 
03:49:10.190 --> 03:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
the other side is you gotta you know you
 
03:49:11.450 --> 03:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
got to do something you got to get it on
 
03:49:13.250 --> 03:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
the books you get you do have some
 
03:49:16.130 --> 03:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
effort you know to make it illegal and
 
03:49:18.530 --> 03:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
make it clear it's illegal yes but if
 
03:49:21.050 --> 03:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
you if you that you know that yeah the
 
03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
the problem with any law
 
03:49:25.190 --> 03:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is only as good as you know
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's aware of some breaking the
 
03:49:28.969 --> 03:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
law and can enforce it
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
Danielle from The Liquor Commission was
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be here but she was out sick
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
today oh she's trying to get somebody to
 
03:49:39.290 --> 03:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
take her place to be
 
03:49:43.370 --> 03:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:45.530 --> 03:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that some of the Liquor
 
03:49:47.090 --> 03:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
Commission will be here yeah I would
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
like an answer as to what happens to the
 
03:49:49.920 --> 03:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
like an answer as to what happens to the
product

03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
that when what actually happens what
 
03:49:55.389 --> 03:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
happens to the product
 
03:49:58.130 --> 03:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
you know if this is enacted within what
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
is it 60 days right then yeah they'll
 
03:50:03.769 --> 03:50:03.779 align:start position:0%
just ship it to some other vendor
 
03:50:05.809 --> 03:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
somebody out of some other state that
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a law would you know that
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
so we have tried to have this
 
03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
conversation with the folks from The
 
03:50:22.130 --> 03:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission my understanding is
 
03:50:25.729 --> 03:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
that they would initially
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
make them aware that this is not legal
 
03:50:29.929 --> 03:50:29.939 align:start position:0%
to sell in New Hampshire perhaps suggest
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
that they ship it back to the
 
03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or something like that and
 
03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
that if they were continuing to sell the
 
03:50:37.610 --> 03:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
product then then there would be
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement with regard to other
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
businesses that might be selling these
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
process these products I don't think any
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
of us envisioned this bill as a
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive 100 percent solution these
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
products are available mail order so
 
03:50:55.010 --> 03:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
there's nothing New Hampshire can do to
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
stop somebody from ordering it from
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
Texas and having it delivered
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is make it very
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
clear that New Hampshire law does not
 
03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
authorize the sale of these products so
 
03:51:08.570 --> 03:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
it would allow enforcement my
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
understanding at the licensees we've
 
03:51:12.170 --> 03:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
already mentioned and what a few states
 
03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
have done recently the Connecticut
 
03:51:16.370 --> 03:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office did a
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
Statewide Crackdown I believe they sent
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
cease and desist letters to businesses
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
that were selling these products and
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
then any that were still doing so as of
 
03:51:26.450 --> 03:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
a certain date they actually rated them
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
and confiscated the products so that may
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
be an option for New Hampshire once it's
 
03:51:32.210 --> 03:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
clear there will be some training would
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
be updated for all the enforcement but
 
03:51:39.050 --> 03:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
he says at the end if it is an illegal
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
item they would need a court order
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
to destroy it the evidence
 
03:51:48.429 --> 03:51:48.439 align:start position:0%
so they they could come is that I assume
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
either that means they can confiscate it
 
03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
and then hold it and wait till they get
 
03:51:54.769 --> 03:51:54.779 align:start position:0%
the court order to
 
03:51:58.969 --> 03:51:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's a whole Brave New World
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman doing it this way but let's
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
see what happens his response okay uh
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
but at least
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill would help get it off the
 
03:52:16.250 --> 03:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
counter where teenagers are picking it
 
03:52:16.260 --> 03:52:17.750 align:start position:0%
counter where teenagers are picking it
up

03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I mean that's that's really the most
 
03:52:20.570 --> 03:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we're taking care
 
03:52:22.610 --> 03:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
of this this loophole that's in our
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
statute he says the answer is yes
 
03:52:27.650 --> 03:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
that that's what would happen so they
 
03:52:29.570 --> 03:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
would be able to confiscate it
 
03:52:31.490 --> 03:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
but then they would have to thank you
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
court order to destroy the evidence
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
03:52:38.210 --> 03:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
protocol and evidence anyway right so I
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
assume that's what happened to that
 
03:52:42.530 --> 03:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
video poker machine nothing new Oh
 
03:52:44.090 --> 03:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
either that somebody took it home and
 
03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.210 --> 03:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
okay so John is is there going to be an
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to this guy I hope yes so we
 
03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
have to have an amendment so we can have
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
a uh straw vote uh for ought to pass
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative petusic
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:08.279 --> 03:53:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:13.370 --> 03:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs seconds
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
that moves 0.03 to 0.3
 
03:53:43.309 --> 03:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes that would that need to be
 
03:53:45.120 --> 03:53:46.429 align:start position:0%
yes that would that need to be
correction

03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
correction
 
03:53:48.530 --> 03:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
so Aiden tells me that the machine was
 
03:53:48.540 --> 03:53:49.700 align:start position:0%
so Aiden tells me that the machine was
steamrolled

03:53:49.700 --> 03:53:49.710 align:start position:0%
steamrolled
 
03:53:49.710 --> 03:53:52.389 align:start position:0%
steamrolled
[Laughter]

03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:53:59.330 --> 03:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:54:06.290 --> 03:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody yes any discussion all
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
