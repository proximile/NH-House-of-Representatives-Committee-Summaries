to study hospitality and tourism

education in New Hampshire and I have a
 
00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
good morning Senator Ennis

good morning Mr chair good morning
 
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.070 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
uh

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
for the record Dan Ennis from Bradford
 
00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire District Seven and I'm
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
here before you to introduce Senate bill
 
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
37. this is a a nice little simple Bill
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
Bill let me give you a little background
 
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
on it as you may know I've been in the
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
hospitality business myself here in the
 
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
state I'm still have an interest out of
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
state in the industry uh and I'm a
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
professor at UNH marketing is my primary
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
discipline but I'm in the department of
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
hospitality management and over the last
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
number of years we've witnessed a
 
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
general decline in interest in this
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
industry beginning in the high schools
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
following all the way through to the
 
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
community colleges as well as the
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 align:start position:0%
that runs counter to our state's needs
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
as you know tourism travel and tourism
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
is a major part of our state's economy
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
as we're building the budget we look at
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals tax it's a big deal
 
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
industry so some discussions over the
 
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
last several years it occurred to me
 
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
that you know we're not meeting the
 
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.390 align:start position:0%
that you know we're not meeting the
demand

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
that the industry has for graduates
 
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
whether it's Community College or high
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
school or or the universities in fact
 
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
the estimates are from the New Hampshire
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants and Lodging Association that
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
the institutions are meeting about 10
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
percent of that demand
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this commission is to
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at things and try to really
 
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on but more
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
importantly what we might be able to do
 
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
about that whether it's a public-private
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
partnership with industry or it's a
 
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
change in the way we're doing funding or
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
maybe something even simpler than that
 
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
that will encourage young people to take
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
a look at this industry it's a terrific
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
industry it's it's really doing well
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's growing very quickly right now
 
00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 align:start position:0%
we'll hope that continues that's good
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
for the state and for workers so the
 
00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
commission includes the usual menu of
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
senators and representatives but also
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
the president of the New Hampshire
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants and Lodging Association and
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
owner operator of a restaurant owner
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
operator of a hotel and representatives
 
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire community college
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
system and the university system of New
 
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as a representative
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
from CTE appointed by the Department of
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
Education so I think it'll be a good
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
commission that will help us to
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand the issue and really dig into
 
00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
to it and ideally will give us some
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
direction on where to go from here I'm
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if there are
 
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.330 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if there are
any

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
um do you envision that this commission
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
will also study where to house these
 
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
these folks that's a really interesting
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
question and last week I actually went
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the New London Hospital to hear about
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
the project that's being done there
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
which should help the hospital with some
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
of their staffing issues I don't see why
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
that couldn't be considered and we know
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the Seacoast in particular that's a
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
major issue affordable housing is is in
 
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
short supply and while the industry has
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
raised the wages significantly in the
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
last number of years
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
um it's hard it's hard for anyone to
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
afford to live in the Seacoast at this
 
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
point so I'm sure that will be a
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
consideration yes
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
for the question because again in my
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
area there's no housing there's just no
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
housing I'm in the North Country though
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
the good news is we have five new Mega
 
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
hotels coming in and they could stay
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
there yeah if um they got jobs yeah and
 
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know you see with a lot of resort
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
hotels and that sort of thing they will
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
put housing in for their employees
 
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
um and Glacier Park is one of my
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
favorite places on Earth and I'm always
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
amazed at the number of people who
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
descend on that Park and loop there
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
um in seasonal housing so there are
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
solutions that can work and and again
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the public private
 
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
partnership sort of activity similar to
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in New London yes
 
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
the only questions yeah representative
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Senator Ennis for
 
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
coming to see us uh as the prime sponsor
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
on this bill and as it sets up the
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
number of folks who are going to be on
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
it says two members of the Senate
 
00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459 align:start position:0%
appointed by the president are you
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
willing to be one of those members of
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
course thank you yes
 
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.389 align:start position:0%
course thank you yes
representative

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
I ask because
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
um I represent Hollis in Brooklyn we
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Agriculture there our
 
00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
hospitality industries inextricably
 
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
linked with that element and I wondered
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
because agritourism is probably one of
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
the biggest things I'm trying to expand
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
as a culinarian of 40 years in the state
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
and wondered if you hadn't considered
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
that part of that might cover that
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
because people being interested in much
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
like they do in Europe and in Italy that
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
model we could identify here and do as
 
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019 align:start position:0%
well much like many of the institutions
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
and farms in my in my district I think
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's a fantastic question and believe
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
it or not
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I have 154 Acre Farm in Bradford and
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that we've been
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
thinking about we're not doing it right
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
now it's chickens goats and cows but
 
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:52.820 align:start position:0%
people like those things and I think
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
agriculture in this state is Hard
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
Scrabble you've got to be creative in
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
how you generate revenue and I think
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
this is one of the great ways to go as
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
well as Farm to Table and smoothing that
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
process and you'll see a bill on that so
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
somebody will later yes but thank you I
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
I think we definitely should take a look
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
at that particularly for the more rural
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
parts of our state which is entirely my
 
00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:17.899 align:start position:0%
district so yes thank you representative
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions why a
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
commission why can
 
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.050 align:start position:0%
commission why can
um

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
why do we need a commission can you know
 
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
you and others come together maybe
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
monthly to you know form a coalition
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
instead of a commission I say that
 
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.630 align:start position:0%
instead of a commission I say that
because

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
representative petusic is on a
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
commission to study commissions or to
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
get rid of commissions you know it's not
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
the way to we really don't want to be
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
voting on new commissions right now
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea yeah well that vote on
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
the idea uh but but honestly I think
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
that commissions are something that I
 
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
tried not to do but in this case I think
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
we need a good hard look at it and we
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
really need significant input from
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
industry in a formalized structure to
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
keep people on track to do it the
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
Coalition idea is a good one but you
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
know the Coalition doesn't have
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
deadlines it doesn't have a formal
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
process and I I think
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
it probably would have a little less
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
credibility as well and I'm hoping this
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
gives us something that we can really
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
work with to build a better situation
 
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just focusing in uh representative
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
batusic pointed out the Sunset date
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
which is November 1st yes
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
2023 yes and the report is due by then
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
yes do you think that date's realistic
 
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.389 align:start position:0%
yes do you think that date's realistic
yes

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
so in my experience it takes the
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
governor a little while
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
to sign the bill and then appoint
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
commission members they have to do a
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
search yeah
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
um and and that might not happen until
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
maybe uh September October
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
and this is November 1st that makes
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
November problematic
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
um you might have one or two meetings uh
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
before that deadline so
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm perfectly amenable to a later
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
date if the committee thinks that's
 
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable yes thank you for that that's
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
a very important point I appreciate it
 
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I was going to wait to say
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
anything but uh we our experiences when
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
you have all these different people need
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be appointed there's a time delay
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I've been away for a while I
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes forget these things so so
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
maybe you're kind of jumping the gun on
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
that uh expiration date I'm anxious I
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
guess uh usually something like this
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the report that comes out is uh
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
continuing the commission for another
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
two years exactly yeah we're not I don't
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
want to do we don't want to see that we
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
want to get it done and and get
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
something to happen right yes and that's
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
why deadlines are important but at the
 
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
same time you know getting people
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
together and I think you might have a
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
timing problem yes thank you okay rivers
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
and feel
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the uh work for the
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
commission under the commission shall
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
examine existing hospitality and tourism
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
programs and community colleges and
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
universities Statewide including
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
curriculum and enrollment Trends I'm
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that the intent here is for the
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
committee to examine hospitality and
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
tourism programs within community
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities Statewide
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
instead of giving the community the
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
commission uh broad-ranging fishing
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
expedition to go within universities and
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh colleges Statewide is that correct
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
that's correct as a follow-up would you
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
then be amenable to changing the words
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh the wording examine existing
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
hospitality and tourism programs within
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
community colleges and universities
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide to prevent the commission from
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
having the option of taking examine
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
examination of the UNH physics program
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
for example that would be just fine yes
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
my knowledge of physics is much less
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
than Hospitality might as well yes thank
 
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:09.670 align:start position:0%
than Hospitality might as well yes thank
you

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
covered this but uh is there any if I
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
recall Cornell has a a major in uh
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
basically hoteling Hospitality do we
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
have any such thing in this state
 
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.069 align:start position:0%
have any such thing in this state
currently

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
I will be discussing this with my
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
department chair when I get back yes the
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire has a
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
department of hotels and Hospitality
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
management it's the second oldest
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
program in the country second only to
 
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.610 align:start position:0%
program in the country second only to
Cornell

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
Cornell
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
so yes we do and it's a strong
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
well-respected program
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
um and the community colleges has have
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
some terrific programs in culinary and
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
other areas as well so yes we have it
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
here it needs to be stronger and better
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
and that's part of what this is about
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question that
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
that gives me some insight that in all
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
seriousness I'm taking back to UNH we
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
have to do a better job publicizing to
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
our Market is better than what we're
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
doing yes thank you and as I said
 
00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:13.459 align:start position:0%
nothing is easy
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
but it's always good okay we're all set
 
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right thank you
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it greatly
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Mr chairman and members
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
is Henry vayu and I'm here on behalf of
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:46.250 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
Association

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
um I think Senator Innis did a good job
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
of explaining
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh why the bill is before you
 
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
uh why the bill is before you
um

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
under the bill uh nhlra the lodging
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association would have a seat
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh as an association and then two
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
members uh which well a restaurant or
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
and a hotelier
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
um and so we support the bill
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
um representative burles to your point
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
about the housing I was talking with uh
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
one of the uh Hotel years up uh in the
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh North Country uh earlier this year
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
and was asking them how things are going
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
and how's you know Finding staff and he
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
said Henry he said I'm now in the
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
property management business because
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
he's having to buy up lodging to house
 
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh so uh he thought he was getting in
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
the you know the hotel business and now
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
he's having to to Branch out and find
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
places for uh staff that you know
 
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.650 align:start position:0%
places for uh staff that you know
otherwise

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
um he can't stop his place so because
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
they can't afford either they can't find
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
places to live or it's too expensive so
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
but we uh we support the bill I'd be
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:06.179 align:start position:0%

00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
the Granite State College in the way
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
Mountain Community College which they
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
have a culinary apprenticeship program
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
they have a hotel management program and
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
also for the the ski industry we have a
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
ski Management program which is
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
definitely extremely important for us uh
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
just going back to the question by
 
00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Burris about housing you
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
know at the omniberton woods there's a
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
different definitely an issue with that
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh you know we we have to have to house
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of international workers to come
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
here on the J-1 Visa program too and
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes we only have a spot to put
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
them you know we have to rent literally
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
hotels motels down in Twin Mountain to
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
be able to to host them but we also need
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
that Workforce because otherwise the
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
scariest chemical function is key leaf
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
cannot go up you know so it's definitely
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
a Critic a Critic issue we have up there
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
um employee retention the I think
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
and to see how how strong and severe
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
that is I interview so many people for
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
the last 17 years to be able to come to
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
work for us and some of those issues
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
that they have is you know housing
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
education uh sometimes Child Care
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
coverage you know for those workers that
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
want to come work at a hotel you know
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes diversity you know the
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
North country is not really one of the
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
most diverse areas in in the whole state
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
so that can be a little bit of an issue
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
um and something for the off the Record
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
too to share with you all uh that while
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
um that we're Mountain Regional High
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
School just recently got a regional
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
award uh they were Regional Champions on
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
Hospitality Management program so uh
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
they do pretty good they have a pretty
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
good program over there uh and I think
 
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
this study alone will give us will give
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
us the right amount of information to to
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
see where we can we can do better we can
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
we can improve and what should continue
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
so um yeah um I just want to give you my
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
perspective as a former Hospitality
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
worker but I know this this is something
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
that I definitely support and I hope you
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
oh take any questions if you have
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
anything guess we're all set oh we do
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the lack of diversity in
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains could you explain
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
what you mean by that it's just not you
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
know if you if you live in uh for
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
example I interview people that lived in
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh in Boston to come and work in a
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
management uh titles up in the north
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
country or New York you know because we
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
do hiring uh fairs down there to get
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
management here and when they come
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
upstairs like they don't see a lot of
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
things that they can do on the free time
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
you know so sometimes that's
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
discouraging for them you know uh you
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
the North country is is small
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
communities it's not like if you live in
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
Manchester or concrete for example you
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
know that you see a little bit more you
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
know restaurants for example or uh
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
different menus or you know or you know
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
activities that you can do so sometimes
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
that's a little uh you know puts a
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
little you know a negative thought on
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
your head like you know what this this
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
area is not really welcoming when it
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
actually is the opposite uh you know we
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
we thrive on tourism we love people
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
coming to the North Country to visit us
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
uh and it's you know as you know it's a
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
beautiful spot one of the most beautiful
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.529 align:start position:0%
 
okay

Gannon the prime sponsor this bill would
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
establish a committee to study
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
resident-owned Manufacturing Housing
 
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
disputes as well as possible oversight
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
of them last session the Senate heard
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
that residents in these communities have
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
no mechanism to resolve complaints
 
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
against their boards to develop a
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process this study
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
committee would be tasked with gathering
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
information from residents and other
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders resident-owned communities
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
rocs are multi-million dollar
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
Investments which are paid for by their
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
residents thus this study committee
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
would also examine if there were an
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate regulatory oversight
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Fred plett uh my I
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
usually hang out ways and means it's
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
nice to visit Commerce and consumer
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
affairs I am a resident of medville
 
00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
Cooperative in Goffstown it's a 301 home
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
park we've been a rock resident owned
 
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
communities for about 16 years I've been
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
treasurer for the last two years on the
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
board I'm not currently on the board
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
this is very important because there is
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
no mechanism for Resident owned
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
community members to complain if the
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
board's abusing the powers or or a
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
member of the board is abusing his or
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
her powers
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
or they're not following bylaws or
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
whatever and right now there isn't there
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
is a committee there is a committee it's
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's dominated by investor own
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
interests the owners of investor own and
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
even there that if it's investor on
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe there should be some non-owner
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
representation but it it does not serve
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
the resident-owned communities well at
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
all and priority in room knows it exists
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
so so there aren't that many complaints
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
because they don't know what exists
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's it I'll be happy to take
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
questions uh but I'm I'm personally have
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
been involved you know people are people
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
there are conflicts we've worked them
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
out so far but uh if it had gone much
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
further I'd have file the complaint
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
we have questions representative billow
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
um is there an attorney that works with
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
your board yes
 
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
very much so and and follow-ups would he
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
or she be
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
um there to assist you with your needs
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely it does all the time
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
but still having a board that represents
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
resident owned members is uh uh uh so
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
that they understand the environment is
 
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
very helpful for the attorney to appeal
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
representative petusic thank you Mr
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question questions I have two
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh first question would be uh
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
inasmuch as there are three members in
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
the Senate and three members of the
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
house and you're a co-sponsor would you
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
be willing to serve on this board
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you the second question
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
you're on record
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative also on line 25
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
on on the page it says order before
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
November 1 of 2023 I realize this is
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
probably unrealistic would you be
 
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
willing to go out to 2024 absolutely
 
00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:52.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
it representative spear
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
I read on the reports thank you very
 
00:33:58.919 --> 00:34:01.009 align:start position:0%
I read on the reports thank you very
much

00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:03.059 align:start position:0%
reports that the Senate put together for
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's real issues here I
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
mean no doubt about that
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
but I wonder why lawsuits and things
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
like that haven't been tried or have
 
00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:16.820 align:start position:0%
they been tried and they don't work or
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuits yeah lawsuits against the
 
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.409 align:start position:0%
lawsuits yeah lawsuits against the
boards

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I can't don't have any experience so
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
we've had some issues within medville uh
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh but I wouldn't characterize any of
 
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
his lawsuits we've had to take a member
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
to to expel evict and process like that
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
but there's never been no lawsuits
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
against the board to date
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
the the boards are elected they are
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
elected so why haven't you voted them
 
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.129 align:start position:0%
elected so why haven't you voted them
out

00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:50.810 align:start position:0%
out
um

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
that's a very long process uh let's say
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
um the the our bylaws say that the
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
members elect the board members and uh
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
if the board is unhappy with a
 
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
particular member say a president as
 
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.089 align:start position:0%
particular member say a president as
example

00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh they can write a letter asking that
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
person to resign but they can't kick the
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
member off that has to go to a special
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
member meeting which is a five thousand
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
dollar expense and has to be set up and
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
the odds of anything happening are dicey
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
because the member can be spreading
 
00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:25.670 align:start position:0%
because the member can be spreading
misinformation

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
so it's not an easy process but it's
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
still an election every year right we
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
have an election every year so
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
theoretically if everybody in that
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
Community agrees that the board members
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
are being irresponsible
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
why haven't they voted them out
 
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
why haven't they voted them out
um

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
that hasn't happened to date but it
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
could very well happen uh this this but
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
I guess it rather than wait once a year
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
if there's a if there's an issue that
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
the board can appeal you can appeal to
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
an independent board and get results
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's better
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
Okay the reason I go this question I
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
realize you have some questions but
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
um the Commerce Committee has oversight
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
over condos yes and homeowners
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
associations yes
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
um is Iraq any different than those it's
 
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
only a difference is they were owned by
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
the members I own one 301st of that Park
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh and so uh and uh I'm represented by
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
the board and the the board generally
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
functions well but there may be a member
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
who two or two who doesn't function well
 
00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:32.780 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it there right so but
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
over the years this committee has often
 
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.310 align:start position:0%
over the years this committee has often
seen

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh legislation related to homeowners
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
association should try to I guess
 
00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:43.609 align:start position:0%
association should try to I guess
arbitrate

00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
arbitrate
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
problems within a community yes and
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've always decided not to go forward
 
00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:51.260 align:start position:0%
with that because at the end of the day
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're a private Community you
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
have your ownership you have it's yours
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
and and and the feeling that the state
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
should have an arbitrator or a court a
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
judge or something they come in and
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
intervene with a community with a with a
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
with a homeowners association's you know
 
00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:10.790 align:start position:0%
with a homeowners association's you know
uh

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
disputes with each other uh has always
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
seemed inappropriate so why why would
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
this be any different than I mean yes we
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
can go forward with the commission but
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
if if the outcome that people are
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
looking for is the state's going to have
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
some kind of referee over what's going
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
on inside a community or trying to do
 
00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:30.650 align:start position:0%
on inside a community or trying to do
something

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
um this committee has never passed
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
anything like that then I ask you to
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
reconsider because it's a valuable tool
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh that it can happen much more often
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
than once a year and uh it can can take
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
a dispassionate
 
00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:47.470 align:start position:0%
a dispassionate
input

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
from from several sources that make up
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
its mind uh in an annual meeting there's
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
a lot going on on other than the
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
election of members so I ask you to
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
reconsider that uh and it got so strong
 
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
support from the Senate the other body
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a worthwhile tool
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
fair enough eating Beth did
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative brazili
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative Burroughs
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
um what's the process for changing your
 
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
um what's the process for changing your
bylaws

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
bylaws
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh both of the members
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh we we the the uh we we had proposed
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
several bylaw changes at our last annual
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the board vets them with the
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
attorney we decide whether or not to go
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
forward then we bring them to the
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
members to vote at the annual meeting
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
and we do that it did that
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
and rules as well for the question so if
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
you can if you have the members could
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
change the bylaws why can't you change
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
the process you know you mentioned the
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar fee can you change
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
the process to make it easier
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
um to do what you want to do rather than
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
have a commission
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh you're talking with 301 299 members
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
there's two who are owned by the
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
previous owner that's 299 members
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum is not easy first of
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
all second uh it is uh it's easy it's uh
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
to uh mislead people uh with uh with uh
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
false charges rumors flying around I've
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
had several flying around about me and I
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
just addressed them head on so this is
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
not true but this stuff happens and and
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
so it may not get a fair hearing at a
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
meeting like that especially with a lot
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
representative action hi
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
hi you know my concern these things the
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
rocks and I'm familiar with them from my
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
business are actually condos it's a you
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
have an undivided
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
130 whatever percent interest in this
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
common property
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
so because they're mobile homes they've
 
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
received some
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
and they're mostly where you mostly the
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
you got Department of Agriculture
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
financing to buy it off of the former
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
owner oh that's a common scenario but my
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
concern here is you're when you go down
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
this road you're going to be getting
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
involved with mediating homeowners
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
disputes in Condominiums and
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
cooperatives and
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
I just I get it that it's hard to sort
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
things out at town meeting or your
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
community meeting
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
we all have that in our towns I mean
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
I sometimes I think that's just the
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
nature of the Beast
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh but I have so I have reservations is
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
there a question here it's not my
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
question this is a would you am I
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
missing something yeah
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
we got our financing 15 years ago 16
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
years ago for a Citizens Bank and New
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan Fund and I
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
refinanced the New Hampshire Community
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund last year with a Bellwether
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
and saved a bunch of interest in the
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
process but uh the the so and I we are
 
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:04.940 align:start position:0%
not mobile homes
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
we're manufactured housing and there's a
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
big difference and so to uh it's to call
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
a owner of a manufactured house say is
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
owning a mobile or she is owning a
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
mobile home that's a step down my
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
apology no doubt it doesn't move yeah it
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
does not move
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be clear here that in
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
response to
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
um like my colleague's question
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
I believe I heard you say that it would
 
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
be difficult to get the membership
 
00:41:40.609 --> 00:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
together in order to vote to change the
 
00:41:40.619 --> 00:41:41.750 align:start position:0%
together in order to vote to change the
bylaws

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
bylaws
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
even though each all of them have a
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
vested interest in this and that uh they
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
would be subject to misinformation and
 
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.970 align:start position:0%
would be subject to misinformation and
disinformation

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
disinformation
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
if that if if what I heard is correct
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
then is it also correct that what I'm
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
hearing from you is that you prefer a
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
different process because of the
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
inconvenience and the likelihood of some
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
messiness and having the membership make
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
the decision and if in fact that is what
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying can you cite examples
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
where in fact that has happened that
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
there have been examples of
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
misinformation disinformation and not
 
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
being able to get enough people to come
 
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
to a meeting in order to make changes uh
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
how many examples can you get I have one
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
on top of my mind but it won't speak to
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
it because it's it's raw and it's recent
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
and it involves people so I just will
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
refrain from answering the question but
 
00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:40.820 align:start position:0%
it exists
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
follow okay you don't want me to
 
00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
this is only a one-way Street Mr
 
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:57.170 align:start position:0%
this is only a one-way Street Mr
chairman

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I won't ask you about that situation
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
either a question about the bill I
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
realize you're not the prime sponsor but
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
you are a sponsor yes on uh line 18. I
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could expand on the
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
statement it says that the commission
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
would solicit testimony from any person
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
or organization with relevant
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
information or expertise could you give
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
us an idea of what kind of testimony and
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
from which organizations from which
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
persons you would be soliciting boards
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
and members of Resident owned
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
communities including medville where I
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
live but several others and they may be
 
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
able to come up with examples they're
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
not willing to speak to in public right
 
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.089 align:start position:0%
not willing to speak to in public right
here

00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:45.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Priscilla you have a
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
question now thank you I'm I'm still
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out why
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
if it operates similar to a condo
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
association why can't you create your
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
own dispute resolution process and
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee outside of the board
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
so if there are these I mean I get it
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
right A lot of people living in a small
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
community there are disputes but if it's
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
if it's so egregious I would imagine
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
that the membership would want to create
 
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:20.420 align:start position:0%
their own board so they have
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
self-governing ability rather than I I
 
00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:25.700 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine what type of
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislation would be proposed out of the
 
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.710 align:start position:0%
legislation would be proposed out of the
committee

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
um let's say it may not be distant
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
enough from the problem
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
it may be involved very personalities
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
that that uh
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
would lead to further dispute and
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
sometimes you need something a step or
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
two or away
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
to review it with some dispassionate
 
00:44:48.359 --> 00:44:53.930 align:start position:0%
to review it with some dispassionate
eyes

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
representing calabrum
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
I think what you're talking about is
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
having mediation and hiring attorneys to
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
be able to have that kind of mediation
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
and that could be part of the bylaws yes
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
but a board to go to with that mediation
 
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%

Senate report a lot of the examples that
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%

00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome back to the
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and committee
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
members my name is Louise Rideout and I
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
do remember you from last year
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony today
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm from Bayview Crossing Cooperative
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
Allenstown New Hampshire
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I support Senate bill 64.
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is to develop a
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution program at no expense
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
and determine if there is appropriate
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
oversight of resident-owned communities
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
we have been working with many other
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities over the past
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
few years to address this issue and have
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
been opposed by the Community Loan Fund
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
every step of the way
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
why would anybody oppose this bill it
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
does no harm
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
we purchase app hack over three years
 
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.170 align:start position:0%
we purchase app hack over three years
ago

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
since then we have had three different
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
sets of board of directors we have
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
experienced board members not following
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
our bylaws and not applying the rules
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
consistently to every resident
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
Nara park is in financial ruin this is
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
not unique to our community
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
neighbor governing neighbor has been a
 
00:47:26.339 --> 00:47:27.410 align:start position:0%
neighbor governing neighbor has been a
disaster

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
why is oversight needed
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund is
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
a lender and because they are non-profit
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
they are not regulated by any federal
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
estate agencies like other lenders
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
lends money to Residents so they can
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
purchase the epox at high interest
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
the Community Loan Fund stands up the
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
park and then walks away leaving
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
residents with no experience running a
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar Corporation
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more transparency and
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
guidance for residents when considering
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
a plan to purchase a park
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
when we purchased our pack we had no
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
idea that the contract included a
 
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.130 align:start position:0%
idea that the contract included a
provision

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
in which we would have to make interest
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
only payments on a 4.9 million dollar
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
loan to the Community Loan Fund
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
we are also not permitted to sell our
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
pack for 10 years
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
if we do decide to sell our pack the
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
funds go to Community Loan Fund or
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
another non-profit so if we were to make
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
any type of um
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
profit on we can't make a profit because
 
00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:32.819 align:start position:0%
we are labeled not for profit and that
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
most of the members when voted
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
the 68 that voted for it and I wasn't in
 
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
I wasn't one of the 68 but we were not
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
told at that time we were not-for-profit
 
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
every single resident pays the mortgage
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
through the allotment even if they
 
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
didn't want to purchase the pack yet we
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
still don't truly own OPAC
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
we pay Community Loan funds seven
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars annually for technical
 
00:48:57.359 --> 00:48:59.329 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars annually for technical
assistance

00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
in testimony last week it was referred
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
to twenty thousand hours
 
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
the Community Loan Fund gave will we pay
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
for it about two years ago we became
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
aware that there were funds missing from
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
our Park
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of money the New
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community loans fund response
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
was to treat this as water under the
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
bridge and directed us to start with a
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
clean slate the following year
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
this guidance was not in the fiduciary
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
interest of our community
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
we fought for over two years for a
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
forensic audit and were finally
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
successful after the Attorney General's
 
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
office directed The Community Loan Fund
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
based on the audit that it's being done
 
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
right now the forensic got it it was
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
determined and actually
 
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:47.099 align:start position:0%
the Community Loan Fund person last week
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
publicly said that there was this
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
missing money significant amount of
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
missing money in response the Community
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund directed our board to have our
 
00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
community vote on whether or not to
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
report the missing funds to the
 
00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:00.950 align:start position:0%
report the missing funds to the
authorities

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
based on testimony provided by the New
 
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan Fund
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
we discovered that funds were diverted
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
from a bank account by a board member
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
please understand not all residents and
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities wanted to
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
purchase the packs might be in one of
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
them it does not take a majority of
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
residents to to vote to purchase a Pac
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
in our pack we have 287 units but only
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
68 people voted to purchase the puck
 
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
one would think that if New Hampshire
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund had a larger base of
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
support to purchase the puck you
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have these problems I probably
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be here today asking for this
 
00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:37.550 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be here today asking for this
bill

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
the Community Loan Fund has amassed a
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
Fortune over the years if the New
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan Fund truly
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
supports its residents it should assist
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
us in developing a dispute resolution
 
00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
resolution program for residents in
 
00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:53.099 align:start position:0%
rocks at no cost to the state we're not
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
ask we're not Beggars asking you guys to
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
fund things that we don't need
 
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
we just need some help right now
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
since the Community Loan Fund benefits
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
from residents purchasing their parks I
 
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that this committee
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
supports Senate bill 64. I believe that
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will give many co-ops
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
hope that serious issues will have an
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for resolution
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
if you if you were a homeowner in the
 
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
situation right now that apoc is in you
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
would definitely say is there any kind
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
of help that we can get we are not
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
Beggars we're not saying oh you have to
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
fund this you have to fund that we're
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
just asking for maybe an oversight maybe
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
people who aren't right in the sick of
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
it to look I was a federal employee for
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
18 years and I went to many mediations
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
with other employees
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
and usually the government would send
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
somebody in from the outside
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
and that person would listen to both
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
sides and then come up with some
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
suggestions and then and I being
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
participating in that was really helpful
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
and I could see how great it was and if
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
you have somebody already willing to
 
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
volunteer to help
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to be hand-picked by
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund it's it's a
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
beginning can you give us a chance
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
that's all we're asking for thank you
 
00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
he's taking my my uh my question so
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
would you mind explaining how it is that
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
you guys or that the community that a
 
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
minority could decide to sell the park
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
or buy the park rather
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
you said I think it would you say like
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
67 out of over 200 people that's all it
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
took so that's less than 50 that seems
 
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
odd to me can you explain how that
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
process works I I'm gonna be honest like
 
00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:43.339 align:start position:0%
I was I bought my home in 2018 October
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
2018. two weeks after I bought it I got
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
the packet that it was being sold and I
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
went to many many meetings about the
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
co-op and nothing was really explained
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
to us but at that time it was the
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
majority of the people who showed up at
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
the meeting not the majority of the
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
homeowners so that was the problem that
 
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
it was they were just looking for a
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
quorum at the meeting
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
so not everybody was informed and not
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
everybody attended the meetings Sarah
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
for the question you mean choir so what
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
you're saying is
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
um it's just whoever showed up to that
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
meeting it's not necessarily like
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
everybody has to vote it's just whoever
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
she's up to a specific meeting it's not
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
even like a necessarily an election day
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
it's you have to show up for it or yeah
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
it was just excuse me it was to show up
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
but we also had to have that member fee
 
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
paid to be able to vote and and the
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 210 if you look into that
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
that will show you how a lot of these
 
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.510 align:start position:0%
that will show you how a lot of these
issues

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
have been helped help the residents make
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
better decisions when the attackers up
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
for sale so Senate Bill 210 really kind
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
of laid the ground work for a lot of
 
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:53.990 align:start position:0%
of laid the ground work for a lot of
this

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you all right
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer is next uh thank
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I've got two questions
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
um have you looked at any sort of model
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
legislation that other states might have
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
on this issue has anybody explored that
 
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
I at this time I I haven't looked into
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
it I'm not really sure
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of family responsibilities
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
right now so I I do as much as I can do
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
but if you could suggest things I would
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
be happy to look into other states I
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're for any type of help we
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
can get so if it's something that you
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
can suggest
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
my number will be on here you can call
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have any
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
suggestions yet but I may come up but
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
the other thing that concerns me it
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like that one of your board
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
members embezzled money was there no
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover that uh that event I
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
would think that the the board should
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
have had some sort of insurance that
 
00:54:58.930 --> 00:54:58.940 align:start position:0%
would have covered that and I'm very
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
shocked that they that maybe there isn't
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
and and I'm also shocked if this guy
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't if you haven't sent the
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
authorities after him thank you
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
with not to my knowledge that there's
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
any insurance to cover any type of
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing embezzlement or
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
misappropriation of funds but for almost
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
two years now I've been asking at every
 
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:21.980 align:start position:0%
meeting what's going on what's going on
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
and if you could tell me the last part
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the question I'm sorry I'm getting
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
old I forgot the last part of that about
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
well have you actually notified the
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
authorities about this
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now is a forensic
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
audit is being done and it's under the
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
direction Community Loan Fund which kind
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
of can is we're in default right now too
 
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
and this is another thing we are in a
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
non-monetary default and everybody
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
really needs to understand what it means
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
we are paying our loans
 
00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:55.700 align:start position:0%
but Community Loan Fund has put us in a
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
non-monetary default for almost a year
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
and a half now with no end in sight we
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
get promise that we're going to come out
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
if we get these paperwork done correctly
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
or if the board is okay and you know
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
management company is being treated
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
fairly but what about us being treated
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
fairly so
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
we we're in the dock to be honest with
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
you we're in the dark are they going to
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
pursue and I asked Mr claspy of
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund over a year ago what
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
happens if there's any wrongdoing and he
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
said it could be prosecution restitution
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
jail time and then I asked him if any
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
other co-op had they dealt with anything
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
like that he said yes but he wouldn't
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
elaborate for me so that I put that
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
information out over a year ago to the
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
family Loan Fund and this is we're in
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
the dock this is forensic audit that we
 
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
are paying for we're paying for they
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
took money from our funds without us
 
00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
even voting for because we're in default
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
so they can seem to be able to
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
run everything so this is what we're up
 
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
against so what we I'm sorry I wish I
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
had more information I want the
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
information to believe me
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh representative
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
Burroughs and then representative
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I'm
 
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
going to go back to my question about
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
the bylaws and relate it to what
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan said you know
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
because you you mentioned this meeting
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
where the bylaw said it was a majority
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
of members present and would you believe
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like you're you haven't
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
gotten good advice legal advice in terms
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
of the bylaws
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of insurance so I'm
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if if um would you think that
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
rather than a committee that there needs
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
to be some kind of resource for
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
communities like yours to advise so that
 
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
you don't have to hire a 700 an hour
 
00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.490 align:start position:0%
you don't have to hire a 700 an hour
attorney

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
I think that this where we are right now
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
I think we need both
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think to say try to go and do it on
 
00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
your own it's kind of hot and look at
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
the pr look at the money we have been
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
paying seven thousand dollars a year to
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund for technical
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
support and our temp our first bylog
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
templates were from them
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
so if they haven't been changed and
 
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
so if they haven't been changed and
revised

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
revised
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's maybe it's time to do a lot of that
 
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
maybe it is time but like you said we
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
really can't afford an attorney
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
we already have a Pac attorney that
 
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
works for many many
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund aerosis rocks
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
but I think both would be right now is
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
what we need if we can get
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
away from one of them that'd be great
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
like I said when not Vegas asking for
 
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
do you know if you're uh organization is
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
incorporated as an Corporation or as an
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
LLC or as a partnership I was told that
 
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
we are we have you Crossing Cooperative
 
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Incorporated
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
so I was told we are Incorporated
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
as a as a follow-up
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
if if you were a corporation then how
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
does why is it and you may not know this
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the remedy doesn't follow then
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
under the corporations act and a breach
 
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:18.380 align:start position:0%
of fiduciary duty
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
I agree with you I would love to find
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
out that when I asked I sent an email to
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
somebody at Community Loan Fund
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
asking to explain more what's going on
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
and zero response so we do need more
 
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
knowledge absolutely correct we need to
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
know what we got into we need we need to
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
know how to run a corporation we have a
 
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
two million dollar corporate two million
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
dollars a year we take in we have 21
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of loans we
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely need more more direction
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.849 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
infection

00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
infection
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
hi so this is a hearing on a bill to
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
create a committee it and it sounds to
 
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
me which which then might or might not
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
so given that this committee was created
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
and what would the legislation be that
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
you would Envision coming out of it what
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
is it that you think
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
the state should be doing to interfere
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the operations of a private
 
01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:30.299 align:start position:0%
Corporation well this is what is when I
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
heard about this it was being a study
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
I didn't really
 
01:00:38.049 --> 01:00:38.059 align:start position:0%
for me personally I didn't want it to be
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
legislatures making new laws about
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
everything but more of a study that can
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
bring us where we need to be so we don't
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
need laws about everything that's going
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
on so this is what we're just asking for
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit of help right now
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
a steady help of like how we can get to
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
a better place but to to ask
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
legislators to enact things for us
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
if we don't have to get the a study
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
might resolve a lot of the things that
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
are going on like we might we might get
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
enough information
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
anyone getting enough information to
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
direct us in the right past we have to
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't to go
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that's what this bill
 
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.030 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that's what this bill
does

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
just so you're clear well I could be
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
wrong but it's it's would you believe
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
would you believe this is a bill to
 
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
create a committee to study the
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
operations on a broad basis of these
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
rocks right this is not going to be a
 
01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:38.579 align:start position:0%
study on how the money's handled between
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
your Treasurer and president and your
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
Co-op oh I understand okay so it's
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
anything that this does
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
is at least a year away probably two and
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
is far more General than anything you're
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
discussing I mean I think we all get it
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
that your park has a particular problem
 
01:02:00.849 --> 01:02:00.859 align:start position:0%
but this bill that we're discussing
 
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
unless you if you could explain to me so
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative just so you know we had
 
01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
legislation last year and which he
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
testified and we have addressed some of
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
those issues okay and so this this is
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
just a carryover from that that previous
 
01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:18.020 align:start position:0%
discussion all right so
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh thank you Mr
 
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.130 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh thank you Mr
chairman

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
um just follow up on the question about
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
reporting this problem to the
 
01:02:26.819 --> 01:02:28.549 align:start position:0%
reporting this problem to the
authorities

01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
um you said that the forensic audit had
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
been ordered by the Attorney General's
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
office have you actually spoken with
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
anyone in the Consumer Protection Bureau
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
in the Attorney General's office and if
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
you have what did they say
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
I've made many phone calls and everybody
 
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
wants you to go to the consumer affairs
 
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
and that is not helping us at all so
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
they said they handle fraud they handle
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
but you also have to understand as a as
 
01:03:04.609 --> 01:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
a member
 
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not privy to the forensic audit yet
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
and I and I sent an email asking when
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
the members when it's finished when are
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
we going to get the information you
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
can't just call people without the proof
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
we need the proof we need to be able to
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
bring something to them for them to do
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
anything because the rest of it I mean I
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
could call anybody and say Hey you know
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
this is going on we need the actual
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
proof and that is the question I asked
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund a week and a half
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%

response is are the members going to be
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
able to get a copy of this forensic
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
audit so we can go to the consumer
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
affairs we can go go to the other things
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to go to we don't have
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
proof yet
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%

um it did happen before I was here that
 
01:04:58.329 --> 01:04:58.339 align:start position:0%
uh the committee Loan Fund was created
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh a for the purpose of of allowing uh
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks that were
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
privately owned to then be owned by the
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
residents rather than having it sold to
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
another independent
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
um it turns out that most of these Parks
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
do not have leases and so they were very
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to that one owner and raising
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
and lower in terms of raising leases and
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
costs and benefits so in the wisdom of
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature that was 40 years ago
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't even think it was it was not
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
Commerce because Congress didn't do
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
condo bills back then so if uh in the
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
wisdom of the legislature they created
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
this entity that helps Finance for
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
communities for the people in a uh a
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
and good morning to Chairman hunt and
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
the members of the House Commerce
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
Committee my name is Tara Reardon I work
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Community Loan
 
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
Fund which is a non-profit Community
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
Development Finance Institute whose
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
mission is to serve citizens of the
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire who otherwise
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't access Capital by that I mean
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
people that other people won't lend
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
money to highly unlikely
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
I provided you with our annual report so
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
you can read about our work our program
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the success of our borrowers there's
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
some great stories in there the oldest
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
and largest program of the Community
 
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund as chairman hunt just said is
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
the rock NH program Rock stands for
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities and thanks to
 
01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:39.299 align:start position:0%
a forward-thinking legislature back in
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
the 1980s it created not only the
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase but also divined
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing as real estate
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
which isn't necessarily common across
 
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
the United States there's a uniform law
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
commission that's come up with that law
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
but hasn't been widely adopted
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to purchase was created
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
because when you own your own home on
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
leased land it is uh highly unlikely
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
that you control the future of your
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
housing the land can be sold you can be
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
given 18 months notice to move your home
 
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
you're at the whim of a of another
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
investor and uh in fact we've had Park
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
closures here in New Hampshire where
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
people have had to walk away from their
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
homes as chairman hunt said before these
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
homes don't move
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's a negotiated sale
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
where residents buy their communities
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
but oftentimes it's this opportunity to
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
purchase law and they have to pay the
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
exact same price an investor is going to
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
pay for that under the same terms close
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
in the same amount of time so the park
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
owner is uh comes out whole
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
we assist residents who are in that
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
situation by helping them form a co-op
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's a consumer Co-op under RSA 301a is
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
the entity that they form
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
and we've we help them Finance it along
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
with banks as you heard representative
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
let's say Citizens Bank is a uh is an
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a financer and will take the
 
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
hold the second mortgage in that case
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
and we also provide technical assistance
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
as you heard about 20 000 hours of
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
technical assistance and some of the
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
people that are here with me today are
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
the folks that go out to those
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
communities all week all weekend to help
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
out communities particularly new
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
communities learn the ropes bear view
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
that you've heard from this morning has
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
had over 7 200 hours of technical
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
assistance since 2019 when they were
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
formed sometimes that's because a new
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
board comes in they have had three
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
totally new boards in their short
 
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.749 align:start position:0%
totally new boards in their short
existence

01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
existence
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
so in addition to that we help them do
 
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects we've leveraged
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
about 64 million dollars worth of
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funding mostly USDA Rd
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
money as was alluded to before not not
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
likely used for purchases but is used to
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
improve the communities
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
so now there's 145 rocks in the state of
 
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's four more in
 
01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
process right now they contain about 9
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
000 households and that's nine thousand
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
households who aren't worried anymore
 
01:09:14.329 --> 01:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
about whether the land is going to be
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
sold out from under their home and
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to walk away from
 
01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:18.410 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to walk away from
it

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine with 9 000
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
households issues arise sometimes and
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
those are going to arise I want to make
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
it clear whether that's an
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
investor-owned park or a resident owned
 
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
Park you'll hear in a minute from some
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
testimony from an investor-owned
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
resident and in the Senate hearing
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony from a resident and
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
an investor on Park who
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
had her water shut off periodically
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
without any notice when she was getting
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
ready for work and and things like that
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
it's in the it's uh nicely captured in
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
the Senate report so the issues arise
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons uh either about
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
the bylaws and the rules whether those
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
are working for the community whether
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're being enforced fairly or whether
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
those rules are even reasonable and if
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
you look back through the the
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
um list of the published opinions that
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing board has heard
 
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
over the years A lot of times it's the
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable enforcement of a rule or the
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
reasonableness of a rule that's the
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
subject matter there those are things
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
that we deal with with communities all
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
the time and they do every Community has
 
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
an attorney if they're going to change
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
bylaws they propose a draft and run it
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
by their attorney to make sure it's
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
still within the law
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
and then there are people issues and the
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
people issues we can't control we're
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're not referees we're not babysitters
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
conflict resolution people we provide
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
technical assistance on the running of a
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
community and I'm not sure we can
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
legislate a solution to the people
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
issues that happen but but they are
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
widened wide-ranging
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
so we will work as we can with rules and
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
bylaws membership meetings making sure
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
that they're noticed so people know when
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
they are making sure agendas go out so
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
people can attend meetings uh there's a
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
lot of information given out at meetings
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
that people don't hear because they
 
01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
don't they don't attend the meetings and
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's like any small town hall meeting or
 
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
democracy the world is run by those that
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
show up and in the case of deciding to
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
become a rock membership meetings do
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
have quorums but once they've met the
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
Quorum it's those that are present that
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
actually vote
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
on how that Community is run and who's
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
elected to those boards which I think
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
has come up as an issue before
 
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
so the only
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
um the only place the investor had a
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
chance to uh turn not to their board
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
what was to the manufactured housing
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
board that existed under the office of
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
oplc until hb2 it existed there is a
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
bill alive right now SB 203 that
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administration
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
heard the other day that revised the
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board that's
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
currently run by the state made it a
 
01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:12.380 align:start position:0%
smaller number of members more efficient
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
and that was introduced prior to knowing
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
that the governor was going to
 
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
reorganize oplc but it exists and it
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
works now and it works for Resident
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
owned communities and investor-owned
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
communities and it is the perfect
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
template or model for exactly what we're
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
talking about here a dispute resolution
 
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
with people who know the business of
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
living in Iraq or owning a an
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
investor-owned community
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
and the bill contemplates adding
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
somebody from housing action New
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire somebody with expertise in
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
housing in order to round out that
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
five-person board but investor-owned
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
communities need to be part of this
 
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
conversation you've heard about Iraq and
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
and you've done some problem solving
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
already you have elections you can
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
change your bylaws people and investor
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
owned communities don't have any of
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
those possibilities they don't get to
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
change their leadership they don't get
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
to change their bylaws or their rules
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
they have no say in that so it's really
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
important that anything that's created
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
as a dispute resolution also include the
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
residents that live in investor owned
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
communities SB 203 as it stands right
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
now is a really great bill over in Edna
 
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and Senator Perkins
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
Qualcomm made some great
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
additions to that bill that makes it
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
better and if in fact you choose to
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
create a study committee I would hope
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we would consider the elements that
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
are in SB 203 and certainly where
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
opposed to the study committee right now
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't include the investor
 
01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:45.260 align:start position:0%
owned um
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
residence as well who really are in a
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
far worse position than the resident on
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
communities my colleague Aaron has a
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
letter from a woman in an investor-owned
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
Community I would be happy to answer
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
questions or be a resource for the
 
01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:02.870 align:start position:0%
questions or be a resource for the
committee

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you my name is
 
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I went online and I looked at
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
the um the board that we're talking
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
could you tell me the name of it board
 
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
of manufactured houses second one the
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
board of manufactured housing and I
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
looked at what their Charter was
 
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
and it didn't appear that it would have
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
anything to do with
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
stepping in between a community and the
 
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
rules that have been set up in other
 
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
words if if a community is not if a uh
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
board I guess of the community is not
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
following the rules they don't really
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with that they only
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
help when you establish the rules
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
but they don't help any Community
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
enforce the rules which is where it
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're having all of our
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
problems or most of our problems so I
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
don't can you explain why you think they
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
might be of any help so a ruling of the
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board can actually
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
be appealed and enforced
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure what the enforcement
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism is I've never lived through
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
that but SB 203 expanded the
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of that board to make sure
 
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
that meetings were transparent and if a
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
member was expelled that they could go
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
come before this board to make sure that
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
was a fair process that they got due
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
process in that so I think with the
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
existing format of SB 203 there's the
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
Aaron did you have anything you wanted
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you OfferUp
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
um so as Tara mentioned I also work with
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund I
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
am one of those Tas who spends
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours every year working
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
directly with a co-ops to help them
 
01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:02.060 align:start position:0%
understand their bylaws to help them
 
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
untangle how to manage a confusing rule
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that they're doing their
 
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
handling their finances correctly
 
01:16:12.179 --> 01:16:14.870 align:start position:0%
handling their finances correctly
so

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so yeah and I on a personal note
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's really satisfying work and we get
 
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
to know people and they do deal with
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
very complex issues and I'm not
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
surprised that sometimes that becomes
 
01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.209 align:start position:0%
surprised that sometimes that becomes
difficult

01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:26.219 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
but um most of them are doing an amazing
 
01:16:28.679 --> 01:16:29.870 align:start position:0%
but um most of them are doing an amazing
job

01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
so I am here today to read a letter from
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
a woman named Mariana davio davio who's
 
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
a resident of a privately owned Park and
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to read her letter
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
because she asked us we do have the
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
letter so you don't have to you don't
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
have to read it yeah okay we do have the
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
letter thank you thank you right
 
01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:52.010 align:start position:0%
letter thank you thank you right
okay

okay
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I guess make sure everybody
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
understands the keywords here is invest
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
your own means it's owned by somebody
 
01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.050 align:start position:0%
your own means it's owned by somebody
else

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
and communion these rocks are
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%

and

01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
from Moda we have I haven't heard from
 
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
Oda in a long time
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
good morning committee chair and
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%

uh you haven't heard from motor in a
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
long time motor has sort of been defunct
 
01:17:35.699 --> 01:17:36.830 align:start position:0%
long time motor has sort of been defunct
for

01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
several years prior to uh covid several
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
members uh left uh the organization and
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
the president of the organization passed
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
away and it sort of went defunct
 
01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:50.450 align:start position:0%
away and it sort of went defunct
uh

01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
I and several of my colleagues along
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%

01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
communal land fund uh resurrected the uh
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
the organization
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's in its
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh uh infancy as a renewed organization
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%

01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
first elected board although I was
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
appointed because I came to the
 
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
community a few months after it was
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
purchased and uh
 
01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.250 align:start position:0%
purchased and uh
uh

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
people behave badly
 
01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:35.179 align:start position:0%
that's no secret
 
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
and I think that a lot of what this is
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
about is is that we have three different
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
rsas that pretty much govern how we
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
operate as a Cooperative we have a the
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
consumer Cooperative rsas we have the uh
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
Corporation I mean the
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah corporate cooperation uh rsas
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
and we have uh manufactured housing rsas
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the problems come when
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
those are not followed the way they
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
should be more so than even rules uh and
 
01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:08.810 align:start position:0%
should be more so than even rules uh and
uh

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
and bylaws because those rules and
 
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
bylaws some what come from what is
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
dictated to how we should operate as a
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
consumer cooperative
 
01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.689 align:start position:0%
consumer cooperative
uh

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
our mission is to uh my name is Kim
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
Capon I'm elected president of Moda
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners and Tennis
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
Association a mission is to support
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners who have
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
grievances with their owners rather
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
whether resident or investor owned I
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
spoke in favor of Senate Bill 203
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
as that is the board where we could
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
refer obvious violations of the rsas
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
that govern our owners and Leadership
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
as well as we could help with some
 
01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:49.460 align:start position:0%
conflict resolution as it relates to
 
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
rules and bylaws of cooperatives
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
I am here to speak against Senate bill
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
Senate bills 203 would address the
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
interest of all manufactured homeowners
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
resident owned or investor owned roughly
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of all manufactured parks are
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
owned by investors and to suggest that
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
homeowners don't have issues of unfair
 
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
practices and investor products where
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
they have no recourse and even more
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
likely become subject to retaliation for
 
01:20:21.130 --> 01:20:21.140 align:start position:0%
complaining make little sense
 
01:20:23.689 --> 01:20:23.699 align:start position:0%
eliminating Senate Bill 203 to replace
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
it with possible solution arising from
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
study committee for Iraq oversight is to
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
leave the majority of homeowners
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners with no place to
 
01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.689 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners with no place to
go

01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
for Relief they can bring their issues
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
to Moda but without a government
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
oversight board to review RSA violations
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable homeowners are
 
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
forced to endure unfair and retaliatory
 
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
punishment from investor owners who
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't always have the best interest of
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
their tenants and homeowners now all
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
investor owners are equal in the fair
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
treatment of their tenants just as not
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
all rock leaders are looking out for the
 
01:20:55.729 --> 01:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
best interests of their resident owners
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
many of these residents can't afford
 
01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
attorneys to help them protect their
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
interest and have a conflict resolution
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
boot is having a conflict resolution
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
vote is important
 
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
affordable home ownership as well as
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
affordable rentals especially for lowest
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
income households is depleting rapidly
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
throughout our country something we have
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
all should be concerned about
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners struggle more
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
today than ever before is even their own
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
home as even they even as they own their
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
own home the lot fees are increasingly
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
becoming unaffordable as they struggle
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
to maintain their homes and keep up with
 
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
predatory investors knowing they have a
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
captive emphasis on captive homeowner
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
resident ownership of the communities
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
has proven to be a way of them to
 
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
maintain affordability and security but
 
01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:39.380 align:start position:0%
that comes with the challenges as well
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
governance as rock owners sometimes go
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
awry depending on the resident's full
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
understanding of their rights as
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
resident owners manufactured homeowners
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
in investor-owned Parks also face
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
challenges of some owners neglecting
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs as well as having
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
owner's rules and unreasonable lot fee
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
hikes that Force residents out
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
usually losing their biggest investment
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
and now facing homelessness or
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing both options everyone
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
would like to avoid
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
whatever this committee and eventually
 
01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:13.460 align:start position:0%
the legislature decides the residents uh
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
the residents are the most aware of
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
their issues and many of them the most
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
capable of suggesting Solutions some of
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
us have lived in rock communities for
 
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
many years some have lived to invest
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
their own communities for many years as
 
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
well as many have been part of Both
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
Worlds the reason I support Senate Bill
 
01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
203 is that the experience would be
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
valuable in understanding the issues in
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
law and the law and how best to craft
 
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
Solutions tailored to meet those
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
expectations of the law the manufactured
 
01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
housing board being eliminated in
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
creating an oversight entity to review
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
rocks only is to leave thousands of
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners with no place to
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
turn when their rights are violated
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
please consider these issues carefully
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
as you deliberate on a solution thank
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
you very much for listening I'd be
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%

delighted to answer any of your
questions

01:22:59.050 --> 01:22:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative McLaren
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman I I still don't
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
quite understand who you represent are
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
you a state run program or is it a
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
National Organization that you represent
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
Moda is is an organization that uh why
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't you explain what motor
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
what Boda stands for Moda stands for
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners and tenants
 
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.470 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners and tenants
Association

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's basically an organization that uh
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
was pretty much sanctioned by the uh the
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
government of of New Hampshire
 
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh they they in the past have had a
 
01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.790 align:start position:0%
uh they they in the past have had a
representative

01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh from their organization uh serving on
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing board uh and
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
they generally are appointed by the by
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
the governor and their involvement was
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
investor owned Parks actually both but
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
mainly their the complaints they would
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
get would be from investor on Parks but
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
they also dealt with homeowner with
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
all set just a quick quote so you you
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
are against this bill and it's in its
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
present form
 
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
well there is no bill well in it the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
study I should say the study itself
 
01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
is uh to uh study oversight of rocks
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
if Senate Bill if this
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
replaces Senate Bill 203 it replaces the
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board
 
01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.630 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board
then

01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
investor owned
 
01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
residents have no place to go
 
01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.790 align:start position:0%
residents have no place to go
uh

01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is no doubt that we believe I
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
believe that rocks and invests to own
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
residents need some sort of recourse
 
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
against uh Rogue boards on Resident
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
owned communities and uh uh investor uh
 
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
owned uh investors who are not taking
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
good care of of the infrastructure and
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
the things that are necessary for
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
someone to live in their home
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
for the record you did check that you
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
were in support of the bill
 
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.890 align:start position:0%
were in support of the bill
I

01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
01:25:22.689 --> 01:25:22.699 align:start position:0%
for the record I messed up
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
okay because we just noticed you're on
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
the board of directors of
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
of the uh yes I am yeah I've served on
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
that board for coming up on I'm I'm
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
termed out at the end of this year yes
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
all right and I I spent a lot of time in
 
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
support of rock leaders across the
 
01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
country I also have served in the past
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
on Rock USA which which serves to do the
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
same thing as a Community Loan Fund does
 
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
only does it nationally got it uh so I'm
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of of training and uh
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
supportive Rock leaders around the
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
country to uh make them better leaders
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that we don't face things like we're
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
facing today good representative Herbert
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
has a question if you're willing to take
 
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:09.410 align:start position:0%
has a question if you're willing to take
it

01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious if I understand correctly
 
01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:12.890 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious if I understand correctly
the

01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
the board the manufacturer housing board
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
is part of the office of licensure yes
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
it is and uh that's my understanding
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
what I don't understand is
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh 203 I'm getting mixed messages the
 
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
way I hear it sure Senate Bill 203
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
does Senate Bill 203
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
get rid of the manufacturer housing
 
01:26:34.679 --> 01:26:36.229 align:start position:0%
get rid of the manufacturer housing
board

01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
Senate l203 does not it it actually
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
tries to revamp it so that it is so that
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh more more geared to to be fair to
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities as well as
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
investing on communities it's basically
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
needs better representation from
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities just follow
 
01:26:59.930 --> 01:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
one question for the question may
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
inquire if if uh if 203 were part of
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh the law
 
01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:11.060 align:start position:0%
does that make the manufacturing board
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board the place to
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh get a resolution
 
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
yes so it would
 
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah Senate
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's staying in place and if
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 203 was was adopted
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this that this Senate
 
01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:33.709 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this that this Senate
bill

01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear just a quick
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that the what
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
you're nervous about is that 64 could
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
possibly if we actually set up a
 
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee and all the rest of that that
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
it could actually get rid of uh 203. it
 
01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
could do that but it also and and
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
getting rid of 203
 
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't uh leaves no place for
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
investor owned which I understand but
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
why do you think it will get
 
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
say it again why do
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
why do you that such a committee in
 
01:28:18.729 --> 01:28:18.739 align:start position:0%
their work would get rid of SB 203 I I'm
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
it was it just a chance
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
203 is is facing some uh some
 
01:28:29.689 --> 01:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
difficulties now uh if there's there's
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
movement afoot to to just to disband it
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh to eliminate it and uh
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
and so so you have two bills out there
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
that are sort of trying to address
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh the same issues uh one uh is is
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
facing issues of funding
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh and that's why there's there's a lot
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
of concern about it and then you have
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
this bill that's concerned about the
 
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
issues that resident owned communities
 
01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh are face face from time to time in
 
01:29:07.129 --> 01:29:07.139 align:start position:0%
terms of having some of their uh some of
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
their conflicts uh a place to go for
 
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that they have in
 
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
so so you so yeah
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
that there's two movements afoot and you
 
01:29:22.729 --> 01:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
sort of have to get together and decide
 
01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:24.620 align:start position:0%
how you best how to best to do this but
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that that 203 is
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
in danger of being uh the housing board
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
is in danger of being eliminated
 
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
because of funding uh for better and For
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
Worse that bill went to Edna
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
because it is regulated by the license
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
board and they're the regulator so
 
01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.149 align:start position:0%
board and they're the regulator so
um

01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that I understand
 
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs
 
01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.350 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
under Senate Bill 203 would it and
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
assuming it it goes through and uh the
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
manufacturer manufactured housing board
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
isn't otherwise eliminated
 
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.450 align:start position:0%
isn't otherwise eliminated
um

01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
could the manufactured housing board uh
 
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
resolve the problems uh that Senate Bill
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
64 is apparently intended to address
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's that is that is what our hope is
 
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.910 align:start position:0%
that's that is that is what our hope is
yes

01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
everybody else set
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay uh David Kirsch from
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
Brookside cooperative
 
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for your time
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of this
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David Kirsch I
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
represent Brookside Cooperative we are a
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
small residential community in Hill New
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we were established as a
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative roughly two years ago we
 
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
purchased our park in April of 2021.
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
we have had our issues
 
01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.750 align:start position:0%
we have had our issues
and

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
that's typical I guess of any new
 
01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.169 align:start position:0%
that's typical I guess of any new
business

01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
that is going into a venture such as
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
owning a park and let me stress this
 
01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
cooperatives are a business what we're
 
01:31:39.169 --> 01:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
looking at here is a bill that is going
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
to step into the operation of a business
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
whether it is a resident owned business
 
01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:48.980 align:start position:0%
or a
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
investor owned business we are a
 
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.209 align:start position:0%
investor owned business we are a
business

01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
people who are not members of that
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
business don't get a say in how it runs
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter whether it's a
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
Cooperative or an investor-owned
 
01:32:01.679 --> 01:32:03.770 align:start position:0%
Cooperative or an investor-owned
business

01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony about one
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
particular park today
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
they got real mess and I agree the AG
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
should be involved
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank the member over here
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
who reminded us exactly why we're here
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's not here we're not here to trash
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
a specific Loan Fund or listen to the
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
complaints that people have about them I
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
have a feeling that that's other there
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
are other places for that we don't need
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
to be wasting your time
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
we also heard somebody say that nobody's
 
01:32:42.129 --> 01:32:42.139 align:start position:0%
asking for any Financial or or anything
 
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
in this grant I am of the opinion that
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
your time is valuable
 
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
and this bill would be a waste of it
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's no need to
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
create a committee to look into just
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
rocks if you're going to do something
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
like that then as you've heard from
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
other people then we should be looking
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
at how investor owned communities have
 
01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
um because just like a Cooperative
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
they're a business who own a park
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
now there's this manufactured housing
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
authority or Association or something
 
01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
and you're going to hear from her soon
 
01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.010 align:start position:0%
and you're going to hear from her soon
too

01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
they represent investor own parks and
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
and then the manufacturers of of homes
 
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of profit to be made from
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
these Parks I mean if there wasn't
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
investment Equity firms would not be
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
buying up properties all over the
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
country from single-family homes to
 
01:33:43.129 --> 01:33:43.139 align:start position:0%
buildings with you know residential
 
01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:45.860 align:start position:0%
buildings to mobile parks or
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured home parks
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
um staying with the current vernacular
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:33:57.649 --> 01:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
what the difference is here between them
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
and and and co-ops is we're not looking
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
to make a profit out of here we're not
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
looking to squeeze every dime for the
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of expense we take care
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
of our Parks because there are homes we
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
live there my Park in the time that
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
we've been been a cooperative and own
 
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
the property we've taken care of
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure needs in water we're
 
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
currently working with an arbor Grant to
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
redo the entire Wastewater system we've
 
01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
taken down trees that had posed a danger
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
to homes and people and and people that
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
our investor owners prior to purchasing
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
in this park had absolutely no intent of
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
now do we have problems in our Park oh
 
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
yeah and we're small we're only 18 well
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
night currently 19 occupied residents is
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
out of 20 on site and um and in our time
 
01:34:59.890 --> 01:34:59.900 align:start position:0%
we've had to
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
expel to members from our park for
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
violations and when we do that we give
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
them an opportunity to come before the
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
board and and and and give us their side
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
of the story one of them did
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he did so without a plan
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
for action so he ended up being expelled
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
the other one chose not to instead they
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
chose to continue to violate rules in
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
flagrant disregard of the authority of
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
the board and as a result we are in the
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
process of an eviction trial
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
now there's laws about all of this
 
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of remedies that are
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
available when the people who are being
 
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
evicted called me personally I didn't
 
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
mention this I'm president by the way of
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative but when they called me
 
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
personally I said look I I can give you
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
some answers but really talk to your
 
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
lawyer you know and as far as
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned I don't remember who
 
01:35:58.139 --> 01:35:59.270 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned I don't remember who
now

01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
um about the um the the manufactured
 
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
housing board
 
01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:04.490 align:start position:0%
housing board
um

01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
the board of manufactured housing which
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
can handle resolution and can handle
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
disputes somebody mentioned that you
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
know people don't know it I think it was
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
that one woman from the other Park I
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
don't know it exists and yeah you're
 
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
right I didn't know it existed until
 
01:36:21.970 --> 01:36:21.980 align:start position:0%
these bills came up
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
so somebody needs to get that word out
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know but um to be hitting on the on
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
one entity in this case the Community
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund which honestly what has that
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
got to do with this bill
 
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're not here to to talk about disputes
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
of one individual park or and and their
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
feelings about a Loan Fund we're here to
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
talk about whether or not you're going
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
to establish a committee that's going to
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
take up to two years
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
of your time
 
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
there needs to be legislation
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
that specifically targets resident owned
 
01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.810 align:start position:0%
that specifically targets resident owned
communities

01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
when you go to the um
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
manufacture the board of manufactured
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
housing website and you look at all the
 
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
disputes that they handle and it's right
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
there for all to see
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
over 60 percent of them are from
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
investor owned communities
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
I think that if you're going to look for
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
a problem maybe that's where you should
 
01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:27.659 align:start position:0%
be looking
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
not here well you can do it here too I
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
mean whatever but the thing I'm getting
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
at is
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know what's good for the goose is
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
good for the gander if you're going to
 
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
create this committee it needs to
 
01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:41.649 align:start position:0%
create this committee it needs to
include

01:37:41.649 --> 01:37:41.659 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
investor owned communities as well but
 
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
honestly you have a board of met or
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
manual yeah Board of manufactured
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
housing already exists for dealing with
 
01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:51.530 align:start position:0%
housing already exists for dealing with
disputes

01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
disputes
 
01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
if the word needs to get out there that
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
it exists to more people let's do that
 
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know if we have an SB that's going
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
to expand the authority of that board
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
and give it more teeth let's do that
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we need to waste any
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
of your time
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
with a committee that's only going to
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
come back and ultimately say well we got
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions from committee
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
members representative billio yeah
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh are you did
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
10 the Senate hearing
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
or SP for SB 64. 54 64. this bill that
 
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I might have I've
 
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
been to so many of these things I can't
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
keep track anymore so
 
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
um there have been many senators and
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
representatives that you know are in
 
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I think it came
 
01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
out of committee
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
six to zero or I think was unanimous it
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
came out of committee unanimous to move
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
forward to the house just FYI would you
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
believe yeah would you believe what I
 
01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
believe yeah I believe it and I and and
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
would you believe that we're going to be
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony from people who are
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to go back to the argument about
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
their personal and and experience on
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
their own Park and how they want to
 
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
blame a specific
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
company as you will for this I I you
 
01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:22.129 align:start position:0%

know
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
tears are compelling
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
I almost feel like we need to box a
 
01:39:28.689 --> 01:39:28.699 align:start position:0%
Kleenex here for some people
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
but let's not let's not insult our uh
 
01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:33.020 align:start position:0%

half that you asked for 10 minutes do
 
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:02.100 align:start position:0%

Crossing since 2001. we own our home

01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
retirement fund I am currently retired
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
from the Postal Service after completing
 
01:40:35.209 --> 01:40:35.219 align:start position:0%
20 years of full-time

20 years of full-time
service

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
when we became a co-op in the year 2019
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
I had high expectations that we would be
 
01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
able to care for the day-to-day business
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
of owning the mobile home park
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured home park would support
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
from Moroccan and clf this is what we
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
were told when we were when they were
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
campaigning for our future I certainly
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
felt comfortable with the assurance that
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
they would guide us through that and
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
meant in better Adventure the night we
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
voted to become a co-op I immediately
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
stood up and weighed 30 in cash for the
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
application fee required to start the
 
01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.709 align:start position:0%
application fee required to start the
process

01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
Amy and what NH employee wrote out the
 
01:41:21.169 --> 01:41:21.179 align:start position:0%
receipt and told me that it was that
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
deducted from my membership fee we
 
01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
quickly nominated five directors my
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
husband chose to become the vice
 
01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.330 align:start position:0%
husband chose to become the vice
president

01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:41:31.689 --> 01:41:31.699 align:start position:0%
the board was later told that they had
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
interviewed several management companies
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
and chose the best suited before they
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
were done Michelle supery and Iraq NH
 
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
technical assistant told the board
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
members that they had to come up with a
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
management company that night
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
because they had one more to interview
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
where CFL would pull the loan she had
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
another woman with her that night and
 
01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
told them that we had to use their her
 
01:41:58.860 --> 01:41:59.930 align:start position:0%
told them that we had to use their her
company

01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:42:02.689 --> 01:42:02.699 align:start position:0%
her name was Joya Hughes from Compass
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
management and yes Joya was the young
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
lady I gave the thirty dollars in cash
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
the night we voted so she was
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
representing Rock
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
I was confused because
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
she's in rock one day and and now she's
 
01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
running a management company that we're
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
told we have to have and my husband
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
stressed it was mandated
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
it turned out
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
The Joy was seriously unexperienced with
 
01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:34.820 align:start position:0%
the job she double charged rent
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
charged me with a high bill of water
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
usage I told her that she made a mistake
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
I proved that she was supposed to build
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
a Jessica duby on 28th Turnpike in
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
Allenstown which is part of our property
 
01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
Allenstown which is part of our property
um

01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
her response was well I had to Bill it
 
01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.629 align:start position:0%
her response was well I had to Bill it
somewhere

01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
that was on the phone we had a resident
 
01:43:02.090 --> 01:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
start a petition to remove her from rock
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
and rock did uh
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
Rock supported that Mr supery was also
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
removed and was replaced by Kelly
 
01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.250 align:start position:0%
removed and was replaced by Kelly
ciccarelli

01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
ciccarelli
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
flax fire management now replaced
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
Compass to be Keeper of the records
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
process eviction
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
Etc now I'm going to point out some of
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
the issues that we had to face over the
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
last couple of years
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
and we have nowhere to go and this is
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
why we need this bill we had a paid
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance maintenance employee that
 
01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
also lived in the park he managed to be
 
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
nominated through the operations
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
director Rock NH and cflf knew this was
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest it did nothing to
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
fix it several months later he moved
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
into the president's seat when the past
 
01:43:57.649 --> 01:43:57.659 align:start position:0%
president moved out of the park he
 
01:43:59.709 --> 01:43:59.719 align:start position:0%
requested a raise
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
requested to remove the rent bill
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
because of his employment he gave his
 
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
two crew members a Christmas bonus paid
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
vacation without
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
foreign approval still no help from work
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
or clf after we begged them to have him
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
removed from the board receipts were
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
missing written without documentation of
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
what which was charged and my husband
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
found one receipt with his initials
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
forged and when he questioned it it was
 
01:44:31.609 --> 01:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
ignored two board members took my
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
husband out to the pits for a private
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
meeting he asked where the fourth member
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
was and they told him they didn't need
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
her Rick told them there was an
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and left
 
01:44:46.850 --> 01:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
my husband was the chair of the bylaws
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee and he wanted to ensure the
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph that disallowed a paid
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
employee to serve on the board at any
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
capacity due to conflict the president
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
submitted the revised policy to
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
attorney Shepherd for approval and he
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
stated it was fine this was not
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
acceptable to him so he hired another
 
01:45:07.199 --> 01:45:09.169 align:start position:0%
acceptable to him so he hired another
attorney

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
who we believe is still on our rolls
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
to try and put a stop to that closet
 
01:45:22.129 --> 01:45:22.139 align:start position:0%
says that he can't work and get paid and
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
be on the board
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
and from what I understand that attorney
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
would not
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
okay that either
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
um he said that the rules that
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
by law
 
01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.010 align:start position:0%
by law
is

01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
has never been voted on by the
 
01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:40.490 align:start position:0%
has never been voted on by the
membership

01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
membership
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
and it is still somewhere
 
01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:45.770 align:start position:0%
and it is still somewhere
um

01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
and we don't have that paragraph put
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
into the one we have now
 
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
that says you cannot be a paid employee
 
01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:59.109 align:start position:0%
that says you cannot be a paid employee
uh

01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
at this point the co-op is seriously
 
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
divided due to lack of agreements and
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
unstable treatment from some of the
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
board members Still Rock NH and clf
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
refused to step in to support us Kelly
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and Chris glasby were at the membership
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
meetings board meetings and heard our
 
01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:22.850 align:start position:0%
meetings board meetings and heard our
problems

01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
in person and on Zoom we had two board
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
positions vacant since December and
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
January and rock NH CFL recommended we
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
wait until May for elections
 
01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
this is not what we want we wanted to
 
01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
have them filled in January when we

septic
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
when I brought it to the attention of
 
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
the Community Loan Fund year after year
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
that we're not having meetings and we're
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
not having annual meetings and when they
 
01:51:12.770 --> 01:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
tried to get out of having another
 
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
meeting this year they had me beat up
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
got all my teeth knocked out
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
then they prepared an attorney letter to
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
me and violated me on three violations
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then they've been taking my rent
 
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
money thousands to pay for the attorney
 
01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:32.390 align:start position:0%
money thousands to pay for the attorney
Bill

01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
and now every couple days I get a new
 
01:51:38.930 --> 01:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
we need an oversight committee something
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
really powerful because we have in our
 
01:51:46.689 --> 01:51:46.699 align:start position:0%
park we have
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's no meeting so how can you make
 
01:51:51.609 --> 01:51:51.619 align:start position:0%
yourself a board of directors
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
how we need a powerful committee to to
 
01:51:58.729 --> 01:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
to to enforce I mean how do you how do
 
01:52:01.129 --> 01:52:01.139 align:start position:0%
you get those Crux out of the top
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
positions we can't do it from within
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
because they have the power of the
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
attorney they have Community Loan Fund
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
they have our Park management company
 
01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
they have all the rules in the court
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
system under landlords and the only the
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
only thing that we can sue them on is if
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
somehow the board of directors has
 
01:52:25.129 --> 01:52:25.139 align:start position:0%
ruined your peace and Tranquility of
 
01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:28.940 align:start position:0%
your lot other than that we have no
 
01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
legal remedy to us at all and if you
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
enter into that
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
realm of uh right to quiet enjoyment of
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
the park you're into uh three lawsuits
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
which includes six appeals up to the
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court where they only had the
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
two justices for the couple years which
 
01:52:49.490 --> 01:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
slowed the case down another three years
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
so uh but the case you know this book is
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
a guideline for management but Community
 
01:52:58.370 --> 01:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
Home Loans they don't actually know how
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
to run a mobile home park they're just
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
giving you information of how to run a
 
01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:03.179 align:start position:0%
meeting but they don't know about
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
property deeds and setting up lots and
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
water systems and sewer systems and and
 
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:09.780 align:start position:0%

I'm quick do you think we need a
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
committee that has no teeth or do you
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
think we need legislation with teeth we
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
need legislation with teeth these are
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
these are criminal offenses I mean you
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're silencing the vote
 
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
of 58 members in the in the community we
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%

01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
like that for four years and then and
 
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
then on the fourth year when they
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
finally ordered to have a meeting then
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%

01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%

01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
slogan like Live Free or Die in New
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it has no real meaning it it's
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
it we don't really own anything we're
 
01:54:23.810 --> 01:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
not stakeholders the park isn't worth
 
01:54:25.609 --> 01:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
any money if it was sold we couldn't get
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
any money I own my own home
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
in the park the way community won't find
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh tells it is we or only have a per uh
 
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
forever lease on the actual Foundation
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
under our mobile homes and everything
 
01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:43.139 align:start position:0%
else is Co-op property but the lawsuit
 
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
says if you're going to make us take
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
care of our Lots by mowing it in the
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
branches and the insurance then
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
this program doesn't work because you
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
can't make us take care of our lots and
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
buy lawn mowers and all that stuff and
 
01:54:59.930 --> 01:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
then not allow us to have full use of
 
01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:01.139 align:start position:0%
the lot
 
01:55:04.450 --> 01:55:04.460 align:start position:0%
if you know what I'm saying
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative there was who is a
 
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill is that correct
 
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman have you
 
01:55:14.689 --> 01:55:14.699 align:start position:0%
considered going to the attorney general
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
I have absolutely called the attorney
 
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
general they have no jurisdiction over
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
it although um although it falls under
 
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
the guidelines of RSA 301 and 301 has
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
like 10 sections where it goes to proxy
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
voting and voting and monthly meetings
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
and annual meetings and that's part of
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that Senator avard put in on
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
the SB 203 the original one had but is
 
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
the the testimony of the manager hack
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
should housing board they haven't
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
gaveled in since 2019.
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's only one member they have
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
handled no complaints and if you go
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
through manufactured housing because I
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
own a house in a private park too
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
because it's such a dangerous situation
 
01:55:59.570 --> 01:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
to own in this in this I have to have a
 
01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
second backup so I have a second back up
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
the exact same home in a private park
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
and over the six years that I've owned
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
that the rent's only gone up twenty
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
dollars and every time I show up to that
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
home it's better than the last time I
 
01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
left it because they do all the odd work
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
if that makes any sense so I have both
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
because it's such a hostile and because
 
01:56:23.450 --> 01:56:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm always having eviction notices you
 
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
have to have a backup so I pay for two
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
mobile homes I own two mobile homes
 
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
outright one in Roc Park which I live
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
full time but I also have the backup
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
and you will I'm asking to do the two
 
01:56:47.090 --> 01:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
minutes for me please
 
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'll give that after
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:56:57.239 --> 01:56:58.550 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
committee

01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
my name is Bonnie garies and I'm from
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
Bayview Crossing Cooperative in
 
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
Allenstown I hope that some of you may
 
01:57:07.609 --> 01:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
remember me when I was here on a similar
 
01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
issue last year
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
I am here today along with others to ask
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
you to please support SB 61 that will
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee to develop a
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution program for Resident
 
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
owned manufactured housing parks and
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
oversight of Resident owned
 
01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
housing Parks this bill is absolutely
 
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
needed and it is a must
 
01:57:32.689 --> 01:57:32.699 align:start position:0%
bear view as well as many other co-ops
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
and I do have to add I have about 80
 
01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:36.659 align:start position:0%
co-ops now that have been reaching out
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
to me with the similar problems that
 
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
we've been working for years to have our
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
board comply with our rules and bylaws
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
and not just with our rules on bylaws
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
but also trying to get them to comply
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
with our lender requirements
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
because of the board and the New
 
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan funds lack of
 
01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility we have been in
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
default with a Community Home Loan Fund
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
and Providence Banks since September
 
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
2021 with no end in sight
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
and our community and many other and
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
many others complaints are not addressed
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
by the boards leaving us without a voice
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
for example the boards have had private
 
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
meetings in which the public was unable
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
to attend they spend money on behalf of
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
the park without the required
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
authorization of Park members and not
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
provided financial information to the
 
01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
park members when asked
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
this is a really important issue
 
01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
we asked for financial information from
 
01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
the board for over two years ago
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
and recently received information now we
 
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
have discovered that we have a
 
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.020 align:start position:0%
significant amount of
 
01:58:45.050 --> 01:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
unreconciled funds misappropriated funds
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
and more
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
without the development of a dispute
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
resolution program for a resident owned
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
communities are packable and others will
 
01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities are
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
multi-malooned all the companies and due
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
to our financial mess we really need to
 
01:59:04.669 --> 01:59:04.679 align:start position:0%
determine if there was an oversight of
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities and it's not
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
just the communities that have to have
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
oversight it's the Community Home Loan
 
01:59:09.599 --> 01:59:10.970 align:start position:0%
oversight it's the Community Home Loan
Fund

01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
Fund
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is a step in the right
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
direction in protecting the rights and
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
interests of all the residents in all
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
I respectfully ask the committee to pass
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
to give all of our members of co-ops an
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
opportunity to seek some sort of relief
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
I hope my testimony will not put a
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
larger Target on my back by the New
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan Fund as they
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
have done enough damage to my character
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
because I've been vocal and I just want
 
01:59:40.850 --> 01:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
to let you know that I am looking into
 
01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:43.139 align:start position:0%

01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%

02:01:02.330 --> 02:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
hello Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:03.530 align:start position:0%
hello Mr chairman and members of the
committee

02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Cheryl air I
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
am the director of weights and measures
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
which is under the Department of
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food I am to I
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
am here to speak in support of Senate
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 67. the first proposed change
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
provides clarification of Authority for
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
us to charge for services provided by
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
the state's Metrology lab that are
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
already in rural
 
02:01:28.689 --> 02:01:28.699 align:start position:0%
the second proposed change refers to RSA
 
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
43811 and offers housekeeping changes to
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
provide Clarity to the statute
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
the last change is relative to RSA 438.5
 
02:01:40.729 --> 02:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
field standards and Equipment under the
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
current law all field standards used to
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
carry out the provisions of the weights
 
02:01:47.629 --> 02:01:47.639 align:start position:0%
and measures Act
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
as stated shall be verified at least
 
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
once a year thereafter by comparison
 
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
with this state standards this is
 
02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
challenging in several ways
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
the state Metrology lab is not equipped
 
02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:02.219 align:start position:0%
to calibrate certain field standards
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
this includes the 100 gallon gallon
 
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
volumetric prover used to test fuel and
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
to test fuel and bulk oil meters the 100
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
and 220 gallon volumetric provers used
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
to test liquid petroleum gas meters and
 
02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
linear measures used to inspect firewood
 
02:02:23.689 --> 02:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
these have been sent out to other state
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
accredited or nist recognized
 
02:02:27.649 --> 02:02:27.659 align:start position:0%
Laboratories which is a technical
 
02:02:29.689 --> 02:02:29.699 align:start position:0%
violation of the current law
 
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
with the development of new technology
 
02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
such as electric vehicle charging
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
stations or meters dispensing hydrogen
 
02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.669 align:start position:0%
stations or meters dispensing hydrogen
fuel

02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
fuel
 
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
the practice of sending out our testing
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
equipment would need to continue since
 
02:02:44.209 --> 02:02:44.219 align:start position:0%
we do not have the space or equipment
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
available to test these field standards
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
in our own Metrology lab
 
02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
when the original language was written
 
02:02:53.089 --> 02:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
we were using brass standards in the
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
field that were not as stable as the
 
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
stainless steel standards used today
 
02:02:59.570 --> 02:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
which have been documented through
 
02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
history of stability
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
the stainless steel weights used by your
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
investigators in the field have never
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
been adjusted after calibration since we
 
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
are also very diligent diligent about
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
they have always maintained stability
 
02:03:19.450 --> 02:03:19.460 align:start position:0%
within the tolerance parameters
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
calibration on a yearly basis has been
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
shown to be unnecessary unless a field
 
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
standard has been damaged linear
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
measures such as tape measures could go
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
10 years between calibrations
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed language allows us to
 
02:03:36.050 --> 02:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
require that all newly purchased State
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
field test equipment be verified upon
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
initial receipt then those field
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
standards would be verified at intervals
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
as recommended by the National

members
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
Cena thank you very much for your
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and I do have a copy of my
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
comment clerk very much appreciates that
 
02:04:21.890 --> 02:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
and I might want to reread it myself to
 
02:04:25.209 --> 02:04:25.219 align:start position:0%
think I can understand all of this
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
okay we will now close the public
 
02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
hearing uh excuse me recess the public
 
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:35.219 align:start position:0%
Hearing in 67 so that uh
 
02:04:37.609 --> 02:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
Senate Senator Gannon can have Grant
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
Bussey actually introduce it which
 
02:04:41.330 --> 02:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sent him away thinking
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
that we were running too late but
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
um that we're going to break recess for
 
02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
lunch and be back here at 1 15.
 
02:04:49.080 --> 03:21:25.730 align:start position:0%
lunch and be back here at 1 15.
foreign

03:21:25.730 --> 03:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:21:31.070 --> 03:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
Grant come on up
 
03:21:33.230 --> 03:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do a quickie here because we
 
03:21:33.240 --> 03:21:34.309 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do a quickie here because we
already

03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
opened 67 so we want to uh we recessed
 
03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
it and so
 
03:21:41.399 --> 03:21:46.849 align:start position:0%
it and so
um

03:21:46.849 --> 03:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:48.530 --> 03:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
yeah weights and measures so we already
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
got from the Department to testimony so
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay I I realized
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
you have what you need to know Senator
 
03:21:58.670 --> 03:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
Gannon is satisfied yeah well we'd like
 
03:22:01.550 --> 03:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
you to read his absolutely good
 
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman member of the
 
03:22:04.190 --> 03:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee I am still Grant
 
03:22:06.889 --> 03:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
bossy here to uh introduce Senate Bill
 
03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
67 on behalf of Senator again in the
 
03:22:11.210 --> 03:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh as you know from the
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
Department the Department of Agriculture
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
asked Senator Gannon to introduce the
 
03:22:16.790 --> 03:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
bill making some changes to the state's
 
03:22:18.769 --> 03:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
wages and measures statutes most of
 
03:22:20.690 --> 03:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
these included in the National weights
 
03:22:23.210 --> 03:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
and measures handbook the Senate Edna
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee adopted an amendment suggested
 
03:22:27.050 --> 03:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
by commissioner Jasper and the full
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
Senate approved Senate Bill 67 on the
 
03:22:31.969 --> 03:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
consent calendar uh thankfully the
 
03:22:33.170 --> 03:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
department has already asked the
 
03:22:36.050 --> 03:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
questions which I would defer anyway uh
 
03:22:37.190 --> 03:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
Senator again and thanks you for your
 
03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
support and consideration of Senate Bill
 
03:22:41.389 --> 03:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
67. thank you okay great
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
any questions see you then thank you
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right now we can officially
 
03:22:51.650 --> 03:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on 67.
 
03:22:51.660 --> 03:22:53.030 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on 67.
so

03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:02.349 --> 03:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.969 --> 03:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:23:09.530 --> 03:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay well actually yeah so
 
03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
what I want to do uh where's my oh I
 
03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:17.340 --> 03:23:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:26.330 --> 03:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
all right okay yeah let's go ahead and
 
03:23:33.070 --> 03:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have much of 21 right okay
 
03:23:37.370 --> 03:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
let's open up 21.
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh good afternoon
 
03:23:43.969 --> 03:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
I remain Grant bossy here to introduce
 
03:23:46.070 --> 03:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 21 on behalf of Senator
 
03:23:48.110 --> 03:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
Gannon the bell's Prime sponsor he does
 
03:23:49.969 --> 03:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh putting all his bills
 
03:23:51.849 --> 03:23:51.859 align:start position:0%
together so we could pinch it in one go
 
03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Gannon filed this bill at the
 
03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
request of the Liquor Commission uh this
 
03:23:58.130 --> 03:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
bill would give Brewers and microbrewers
 
03:23:59.450 --> 03:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
additional time to complete their
 
03:24:01.130 --> 03:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
paperwork and it would alleviate
 
03:24:02.750 --> 03:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
concerns they had about the existing
 
03:24:04.849 --> 03:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
deadline which is on the 10th of each
 
03:24:06.889 --> 03:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
month other deadlines such as the rooms
 
03:24:08.690 --> 03:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
and meals tax are on the 15th of each
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
month this bill would permit electronic
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
filing which is not currently allowed

03:31:19.130 --> 03:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
difference in a lot of companies lives
 
03:31:21.650 --> 03:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
ultimately there's not a huge fiscal
 
03:31:23.090 --> 03:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
note to this but it does a lot of
 
03:31:25.130 --> 03:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
cleanup on the books for us and kind of
 
03:31:26.929 --> 03:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
gets things
 
03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
um in order and treats different types
 
03:31:33.290 --> 03:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
of organizations more fairly compared to
 
03:31:34.450 --> 03:31:34.460 align:start position:0%
each other
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
Grant went through and did a good
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
summary I think of the details of it but
 
03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to have Tom go through and
 
03:31:43.849 --> 03:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
give you more details if you have any
 
03:31:48.050 --> 03:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.610 --> 03:31:51.620 align:start position:0%
uh yeah why did you do telemetism
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:00.769 --> 03:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
indicated here the uh my name is Tom
 
03:32:01.729 --> 03:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
Connolly I'm the director of
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
Corporations for the Secretary of State
 
03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
um the bill is was introduced on our
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
behalf um the let's say I think the
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
analysis is a pretty clean
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
straightforward indication of what each
 
03:32:13.729 --> 03:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
of the sections of the bill do
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
um specifically we're trying to do here
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
is accommodate
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
um increase of uniformity for for the
 
03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
various entity types
 
03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the first need to indicated in
 
03:32:23.450 --> 03:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill has to do with
 
03:32:26.330 --> 03:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
registered agents that most entities in
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
the state are required by a lot of have
 
03:32:29.690 --> 03:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
a registered agent in New Hampshire with
 
03:32:31.729 --> 03:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
a physical address as it turns out
 
03:32:33.889 --> 03:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
domestic non-profits are one entity type
 
03:32:35.330 --> 03:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
that don't have them but actually we
 
03:32:37.010 --> 03:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
have non-profits who come to us that
 
03:32:38.330 --> 03:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
have asked you for the ability to build
 
03:32:40.610 --> 03:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
a appointed agent primarily because they
 
03:32:42.050 --> 03:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
want to make it easy for people to find
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
them and secondly if they're small
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit and they don't have their own
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
offensive physical address that they can
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
provide an address it's not an address
 
03:32:51.050 --> 03:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
of one of their members here right now
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the domestic nonprofit they have to
 
03:32:54.889 --> 03:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
have a physical New Hampshire address so
 
03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
someone sets up a non-profit in your
 
03:32:58.490 --> 03:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
town and they're just getting started so
 
03:33:00.110 --> 03:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
somebody in that was on that board
 
03:33:01.370 --> 03:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
remember that's going to have to give
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
their street address their personal
 
03:33:05.510 --> 03:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
address as an address for for for a
 
03:33:07.010 --> 03:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
principal office this will allow them to
 
03:33:09.410 --> 03:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
to use a third party to do that um it
 
03:33:11.389 --> 03:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
would be entirely voluntary
 
03:33:12.889 --> 03:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
um as I said they're about now they're
 
03:33:14.990 --> 03:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
about 11 000 non-profits registered in
 
03:33:16.910 --> 03:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we think that on the
 
03:33:18.050 --> 03:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
first year that there would be several
 
03:33:19.010 --> 03:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
hundred that would probably take
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of this this provision it also
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
allows for example um foreign Banks
 
03:33:25.250 --> 03:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
Banks don't register with the secretary
 
03:33:26.690 --> 03:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
of state but save someone like Wells
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
Fargo who's a National Bank wants to
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
have an address in New Hampshire they
 
03:33:32.030 --> 03:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a branch they can use this
 
03:33:34.130 --> 03:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
filing type to be able to register and
 
03:33:37.610 --> 03:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
file and have an agent in the state
 
03:33:37.620 --> 03:33:38.570 align:start position:0%
file and have an agent in the state
um

03:33:38.570 --> 03:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
the uh second item in the bill relates
 
03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
to foreign corporations right uh several
 
03:33:45.530 --> 03:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
years ago we removed a requirement that
 
03:33:47.929 --> 03:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
foreign companies have to provide us a
 
03:33:49.250 --> 03:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
proof of that they're in good standing
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
in their home state that made the
 
03:33:52.729 --> 03:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
process a little faster we rely on the
 
03:33:54.290 --> 03:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
information they provide them and then
 
03:33:56.030 --> 03:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
Most states have this information
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
available online so we're able to look
 
03:34:00.050 --> 03:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
and verify it ourselves
 
03:34:02.330 --> 03:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
um however but we've asked and do in
 
03:34:03.950 --> 03:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
here is to provide a provision here with
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
the entity has to to tell us that they
 
03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
have actually checked and that they are
 
03:34:09.950 --> 03:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
a good standing before they apply to do
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so the key word that the foreign
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean International
 
03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
that's correct anybody who's not a New
 
03:34:21.530 --> 03:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Corporation will be considered
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
a called a foreign corporation so for
 
03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
example each of the Delaware
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
Corporations if you go to the Delaware
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
website you can't tell if a company is
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
in good standing or not unless you pay a
 
03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
30 fee but the company would have to
 
03:34:34.370 --> 03:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
attest to us when they're registering
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
with us that they have checked and
 
03:34:37.250 --> 03:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
verified that they're in good standing
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
in their home state before they register
 
03:34:43.010 --> 03:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.450 --> 03:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
um I the section three of the bill
 
03:34:46.729 --> 03:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
relates to benefit corporations New
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's had benefit corporations
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
um since 2016 I believe it was first
 
03:34:53.809 --> 03:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
authorized however New Hampshire law is
 
03:34:55.190 --> 03:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
a bit unique from other states as it
 
03:34:57.170 --> 03:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide them an opportunity to
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
indicate that they are a public benefit
 
03:35:00.889 --> 03:35:00.899 align:start position:0%
Corporation in their name using that
 
03:35:03.530 --> 03:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
ending PBC which is rather common in
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
other states and if a benefit
 
03:35:06.769 --> 03:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
Corporation from another state comes to
 
03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we require them to add an
 
03:35:10.610 --> 03:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
anchor corporate limited to their name
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't meet our requirements
 
03:35:13.849 --> 03:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
so this would simply allow benefit
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
corporations both foreign or domestic to
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
use ending PVC if the as part of their
 
03:35:21.950 --> 03:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
um section 4S do with limited
 
03:35:25.849 --> 03:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
Partnerships they're the one type of
 
03:35:27.530 --> 03:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
business that doesn't have the same sort
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
of process in place where if they want
 
03:35:31.130 --> 03:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
to change their registered agent rather
 
03:35:32.450 --> 03:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
than filing a statement of change
 
03:35:34.130 --> 03:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
they're required to actually file an
 
03:35:35.570 --> 03:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
amendment to their certificate of a
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
certificate limited partnership and that
 
03:35:39.410 --> 03:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
tends to be a burden that tends to be a
 
03:35:41.690 --> 03:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
an item because it costs more it's a
 
03:35:43.490 --> 03:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
little more complicated folks don't do
 
03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
it we want to make sure that they're
 
03:35:45.889 --> 03:35:45.899 align:start position:0%
keeping their registered agent
 
03:35:47.690 --> 03:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
information up to date so this would
 
03:35:49.490 --> 03:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
allow them to file those statements the
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
same way that other businesses do by
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
simply filing a change of agent rather
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
than having to actually amend their
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
certificate a limited partnership and a
 
03:35:58.250 --> 03:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
registered agent could also going back
 
03:36:00.410 --> 03:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
to that section one could be that their
 
03:36:03.170 --> 03:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
residency would be with a registered
 
03:36:05.389 --> 03:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
agent's residence or local that's
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
correct yeah they could use a resident
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
agent's address for for all of their
 
03:36:11.210 --> 03:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
contact information yes
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
and then those section five the last
 
03:36:15.050 --> 03:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
section analysis relates to fees charged
 
03:36:17.210 --> 03:36:17.220 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State
 
03:36:19.130 --> 03:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
um one thing we've not yet automated the
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is the
 
03:36:22.849 --> 03:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
ordering of certified copies if you want
 
03:36:24.170 --> 03:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
it for a closing you need to get a
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
certified copy of the Articles
 
03:36:27.889 --> 03:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
incorporation all your amendments that
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
request is still required to go to our
 
03:36:31.010 --> 03:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
office we go through and determine
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
whether we have all the documents
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
um available in our online in our system
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
and then go ahead and generate a
 
03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
certificate a um a set of documents for
 
03:36:43.729 --> 03:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
for a uh for a certified copy
 
03:36:45.229 --> 03:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
um by changing what we're going to do is
 
03:36:46.729 --> 03:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
rather than charging a dollar per page
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
as now most State most of the requests
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
people don't actually want the paper
 
03:36:52.370 --> 03:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
they just want us to email them a PDF
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
that provides the certificate and all
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
the all the documents are listed there
 
03:36:58.429 --> 03:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
but the cost is based on actually a
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
dollar per Pages based on the process of
 
03:37:01.190 --> 03:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
thinking you had to get up and
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
physically copy these these documents so
 
03:37:05.690 --> 03:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
to make that process simpler we'd like
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
to Simply charge a fee of a dollar per
 
03:37:09.889 --> 03:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
document instead of one dollar per page
 
03:37:11.809 --> 03:37:11.819 align:start position:0%
and that way people can see a list of
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
documents select those documents know
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what it's going to cost and be
 
03:37:17.870 --> 03:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
able to pay for it right up front so
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
that will simplify the process it lowers
 
03:37:22.010 --> 03:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
the fee it actually does lower the bit
 
03:37:24.590 --> 03:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
for entities that have a big long list
 
03:37:27.170 --> 03:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
of members yeah they'll have more well
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
folks have a lot of documents on file or
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of pages especially older
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
businesses uh that will definitely save
 
03:37:34.010 --> 03:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
them a few dollars when they when they
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:37:38.330 --> 03:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
and the other item that relates to these
 
03:37:40.670 --> 03:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
here it relates to registered agents um
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
or law firms that change their address
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
um we had a recent example we had a law
 
03:37:47.570 --> 03:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
firm up north that changed their office
 
03:37:49.550 --> 03:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
and they act as the agent for many of
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
the companies that their clients have
 
03:37:53.450 --> 03:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
right so they had seven they took their
 
03:37:55.250 --> 03:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
physical address and then they had to
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
file 70 agent changes or address agent
 
03:38:00.170 --> 03:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
address changes Each of which it cost of
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars so by moving their
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
office they occurred a thief about a
 
03:38:05.630 --> 03:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars just to Simply file an
 
03:38:07.550 --> 03:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
address change with us and we think that
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
for for those sorts of situations that
 
03:38:11.330 --> 03:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
with automation now we don't need to
 
03:38:13.070 --> 03:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
assess that sort of fee it's not the
 
03:38:14.510 --> 03:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
kind of transaction where we have to
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
physically process a single document for
 
03:38:19.010 --> 03:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
each item we now have a process on our
 
03:38:20.269 --> 03:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
website where
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
um Law Firm can go when they can find
 
03:38:23.570 --> 03:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
all the companies that they it's aged
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
for can simply select them and file a
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
single filing with us so we still charge
 
03:38:30.410 --> 03:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
them the same fifteen dollars per entity
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
so this would give us some ability to be
 
03:38:35.809 --> 03:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
able to set fees for those transactions
 
03:38:37.490 --> 03:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
that would be a little more uh again
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
more friendly to the business
 
03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
environment into the people who are
 
03:38:42.590 --> 03:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
acting the lawyers because mostly law
 
03:38:44.090 --> 03:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
offices are the ones are registered
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
agents in many cases Law Offices or um
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
private service companies that also
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
offer that service and accountants yes
 
03:38:53.570 --> 03:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's so nice of you guys to lower
 
03:38:55.969 --> 03:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
their costs Law Offices when they move
 
03:38:57.410 --> 03:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
their own
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
less expense for moving the office okay
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
 
03:39:10.610 --> 03:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:10.620 --> 03:39:26.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:39:26.330 --> 03:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.530 --> 03:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
um actually that's the same category
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
again anybody outside of New Hampshire
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
would be considered to be a foreign
 
03:39:32.210 --> 03:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
corporation even if it's International
 
03:39:36.170 --> 03:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.889 --> 03:39:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.570 --> 03:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
there was something that we need to look
 
03:39:49.849 --> 03:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
at as far as the fiscal note or is it a
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
wash because of the fee structure change
 
03:39:54.590 --> 03:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
and if you want to speak to that
 
03:39:57.170 --> 03:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure what version of the
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
bill that you have but um our analysis
 
03:40:02.510 --> 03:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
was approximately
 
03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
um thirty thousand dollars in Lost
 
03:40:05.929 --> 03:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
Revenue per year for the corporate
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
division but the corporate division does
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
bring in a lot of Revenue and Tom can
 
03:40:14.450 --> 03:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
tell you about what just happened that
 
03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
um for annual business filings and the
 
03:40:19.010 --> 03:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
good news on that
 
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
um the uh yes indicated that the cost
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
potentially we know most registered
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
agents these these large address changes
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't happen that frequently
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
um in this past year we had two of those
 
03:40:30.370 --> 03:40:30.380 align:start position:0%
two two
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
move address changes one that one law
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
firm and one a Service Company Each of
 
03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
which uh that resulted in filing fees of
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
about thirty thousand dollars but the
 
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
previous fiscal year we had none we had
 
03:40:43.130 --> 03:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
no no businesses that moved at the time
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
so the the amount of money we would lose
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
would would be it's hard to gauge
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
because it's not a frequent occurrence
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
as far as the cost of doing the making
 
03:40:53.090 --> 03:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
changes on our systems will accommodate
 
03:40:53.100 --> 03:40:53.929 align:start position:0%
changes on our systems will accommodate
this

03:40:53.929 --> 03:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:55.250 --> 03:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
um we can do that within the provisions
 
03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
of our current software vendor contract
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to ask for any
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
additional funds
 
03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.530 --> 03:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
about business filing since I know
 
03:41:10.969 --> 03:41:10.979 align:start position:0%
there's there's much concern in talking
 
03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
the media right now about the
 
03:41:15.170 --> 03:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
possibility of an economic downturn
 
03:41:17.389 --> 03:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
um usually do business filings is a good
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
indicator of what the business Community
 
03:41:21.170 --> 03:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
is thinking and how it's going to happen
 
03:41:21.180 --> 03:41:22.070 align:start position:0%
is thinking and how it's going to happen
if

03:41:22.070 --> 03:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um this past month in March we had a um
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
there was not a record but it was close
 
03:41:28.750 --> 03:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
to one of our highest months we had uh
 
03:41:32.690 --> 03:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
1675 new LLC formations in New Hampshire
 
03:41:35.150 --> 03:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
typically 1100 1200 a month it's been
 
03:41:36.410 --> 03:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
more or less our constant in the last
 
03:41:38.210 --> 03:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
two years here so we haven't seen any
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
drop in business filing business
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
activity right now
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
um last year we brought in and revenue
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
were told please it was um 4.5 million
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
and unrestricted revenue for
 
03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
um business filings and we certainly
 
03:41:55.250 --> 03:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.260 --> 03:41:57.229 align:start position:0%
 
great

03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:42:00.610 --> 03:42:00.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:02.809 --> 03:42:02.819 align:start position:0%
anyone else would like to speak on
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 197
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
see none
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing
 
03:42:14.990 --> 03:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
so now we're ready for
 
03:42:22.729 --> 03:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:22.739 --> 03:42:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:43.190 --> 03:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:46.130 align:start position:0%
 
jeez

03:42:46.130 --> 03:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
jeez
 
03:42:48.769 --> 03:42:48.779 align:start position:0%
John how are you I'm doing well how are
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
you I'm doing great I have to say when I
 
03:42:52.190 --> 03:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
was a member of the committee it wasn't
 
03:42:56.090 --> 03:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
so um so expansive it's well it's this
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
new configuration I still haven't gotten
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
used to it yeah it's not as intimate and
 
03:43:02.929 --> 03:43:02.939 align:start position:0%
cozy it's well I always kind of like
 
03:43:04.490 --> 03:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
being back there you know having the
 
03:43:12.190 --> 03:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're glowing plenty
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
said but the best part was during coven
 
03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
I had
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
and Fitzgerald come take a picture of me
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
sitting in it and I was sitting here but
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the chair
 
03:43:27.050 --> 03:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
when I had the zoom I had my that my is
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
my zoom background and you wouldn't be
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
amazed at how many people even Aiden
 
03:43:37.729 --> 03:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
said geez are you are you really there
 
03:43:42.410 --> 03:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
yeah then some people had cats walking
 
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
down I didn't even know you were really
 
03:43:49.190 --> 03:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
at home in your pajamas well we won't
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
talk about it
 
03:43:54.530 --> 03:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
sir and chairman we're wearing on a
 
03:43:57.530 --> 03:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
given day but uh no I would have to say
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
that I would I always because I never
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
know when you might I might have to get
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
up and and who doesn't I don't I don't
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
wanna I don't have that happen
 
03:44:08.570 --> 03:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
well it's just it's I'm very conscious
 
03:44:10.250 --> 03:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
now because we're all this is all
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
YouTube so good
 
03:44:14.990 --> 03:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll be there forever
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's very reassuring
 
03:44:19.190 --> 03:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay we're close enough uh we'll open up
 
03:44:20.929 --> 03:44:20.939 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and hear from our
 
03:44:23.450 --> 03:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
former member of the committee
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy good afternoon good
 
03:44:28.250 --> 03:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman it's a pleasure to
 
03:44:30.290 --> 03:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
be back with Commerce see a lot of
 
03:44:32.210 --> 03:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
familiar faces this is a very simple
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
bill it's really a housekeeping measure
 
03:44:37.370 --> 03:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
the beer distributors in New Hampshire
 
03:44:39.290 --> 03:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
benefit from a little quirk in the law
 
03:44:41.690 --> 03:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
that requires all bills to be paid
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
within 10 business days
 
03:44:47.570 --> 03:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't happen they report the
 
03:44:49.490 --> 03:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
licensee to The Liquor Commission which
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
maintains a list and then
 
03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
businesses on the list can't be sold
 
03:44:53.040 --> 03:44:55.070 align:start position:0%
businesses on the list can't be sold
alcohol

03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
03:44:55.080 --> 03:44:57.469 align:start position:0%
alcohol
um

03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:59.090 --> 03:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
the number hasn't been changed in about
 
03:45:03.050 --> 03:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
30 years and at the low current uh
 
03:45:05.690 --> 03:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
number of 100 that's actually kind of a
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
detriment to the Distributors because
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
they get fined if they fail to report
 
03:45:12.650 --> 03:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
those businesses to the list
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and if you read the minutes Liquor
 
03:45:15.530 --> 03:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
Commission it actually happens fairly
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
often so all this bill does is update
 
03:45:21.769 --> 03:45:21.779 align:start position:0%
that number to 250. so it's a little bit
 
03:45:25.090 --> 03:45:25.100 align:start position:0%
higher so they won't get fined as much
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
and Distributors aren't running around
 
03:45:29.929 --> 03:45:29.939 align:start position:0%
chasing checks for 101 dollars
 
03:45:31.610 --> 03:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
so it's a very simple bill but I'm happy
 
03:45:33.769 --> 03:45:33.779 align:start position:0%
to take questions
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
where's Scott
 
03:45:37.490 --> 03:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
he told me he supported the bill but
 
03:45:38.929 --> 03:45:38.939 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice if he was here to say that
 
03:45:42.050 --> 03:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.060 --> 03:45:44.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:45:44.450 --> 03:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
it is it is a very unusual circumstance
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
has this in its statute yes it is very
 
03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:56.929 align:start position:0%
has this in its statute yes it is very
unique

03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members yes
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't know
 
03:46:06.050 --> 03:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
what would be an example of when we
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
would need to do that can you kind of
 
03:46:08.690 --> 03:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
paint that picture because this is all
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
new to me I see so if you have a
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant say that
 
03:46:18.889 --> 03:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
buys a keg of any beer and it costs 150
 
03:46:18.899 --> 03:46:21.110 align:start position:0%
buys a keg of any beer and it costs 150
dollars

03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
the beer distributor will show up on the
 
03:46:24.650 --> 03:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
10th day and say you need to give me a
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
check for 150 and I mean they'll drive
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the restaurant and ask for the check
 
03:46:31.190 --> 03:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
and if they fail to do that or maybe the
 
03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
business owner isn't in maybe they're
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
saying Concord or somewhere they could
 
03:46:37.010 --> 03:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
be reported they would have to be
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
recorded to the list and they could not
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
order any additional alcohol until they
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
had paid that check for 150 dollars so
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
all this does is change the number from
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
100 to 250.
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
for the question we inquire
 
03:46:53.090 --> 03:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
and how often does that happen
 
03:46:55.130 --> 03:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman it's honestly I am a
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
liquor license C it's never happened to
 
03:46:59.170 --> 03:46:59.180 align:start position:0%
me and I've been doing it for 17 years
 
03:47:01.729 --> 03:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
but I read the minutes of the commission
 
03:47:05.929 --> 03:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
regularly and it does happen enough
 
03:47:05.939 --> 03:47:06.769 align:start position:0%
regularly and it does happen enough
um

03:47:06.769 --> 03:47:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
I have probably seen two to three dozen
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
times in the last few years where
 
03:47:14.090 --> 03:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
various Distributors have been charged a
 
03:47:22.250 --> 03:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.330 --> 03:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
and part of the the rationale behind it
 
03:47:28.610 --> 03:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
is because the beer distributors are
 
03:47:31.490 --> 03:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
collecting the 30 cents a gallon tax
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
so the state Nature has an interest to
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
make sure the tax got paid in a timely
 
03:47:39.170 --> 03:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
fashion so in this case the we're
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
holding the distributor responsible
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
and uh rather than
 
03:47:49.150 --> 03:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the line but sure
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative just a quick question
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
10 days just it just kind of surprises
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
me that that's the time period because
 
03:47:59.330 --> 03:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
most standard businesses you know even
 
03:48:00.889 --> 03:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
from a dentist or something give you 30
 
03:48:03.050 --> 03:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
days so just out of curiosity why 10
 
03:48:05.150 --> 03:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
days I think we'd have to go back in
 
03:48:06.830 --> 03:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
time to the legislature that was in
 
03:48:08.809 --> 03:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
place in the 1970s or 80s when this bill
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
was law was originally passed but it has
 
03:48:12.769 --> 03:48:12.779 align:start position:0%
always been 10 days
 
03:48:14.330 --> 03:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
all we're seeking to do here is change
 
03:48:16.670 --> 03:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
the number from 100 to 250 to updated
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
the commission wants its money
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
paid in a timely fashion
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
03:48:25.729 --> 03:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:48:25.739 --> 03:48:26.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm curious why not
 
03:48:32.929 --> 03:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
um uh take the specifics of the
 
03:48:35.809 --> 03:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
reportable amount and the time limit out
 
03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
of the statute and instead say that the
 
03:48:42.590 --> 03:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
reportable amount and the time limit
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
shall be established by regulation by
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission and in that way if
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
it were necessary to change it again in
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
the future it could be changed without
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
having to change the statute
 
03:48:59.450 --> 03:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
the question I tend to myself I tend to
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
favor things being done through
 
03:49:02.450 --> 03:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
legislature I think that's why we're
 
03:49:04.610 --> 03:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
here I'm not a big fan of rulemaking as
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
a way to set policy having said that I
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
think also the Distributors they like
 
03:49:12.349 --> 03:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
the current law because they benefit
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
because the law forces licensees to pay
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and
 
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
I think they would be resistant to
 
03:49:22.370 --> 03:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
granting that sort of latitude to the
 
03:49:22.380 --> 03:49:23.870 align:start position:0%
granting that sort of latitude to the
commission

03:49:23.870 --> 03:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:28.490 --> 03:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
good answer
 
03:49:28.500 --> 03:49:30.229 align:start position:0%
good answer
okay

03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative
 
03:49:35.210 --> 03:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
in real world terms what does the 250
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
dollars represent to a business in terms
 
03:49:40.130 --> 03:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
I guess in purchasing power that is
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
approximately the cost of one keg of
 
03:49:42.120 --> 03:49:44.150 align:start position:0%
approximately the cost of one keg of
Guinness

03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
Guinness
 
03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
um it's the cost of less than two kegs
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
of Bud Light
 
03:49:51.889 --> 03:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
um it's probably in the neighborhood of
 
03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
six cases eight cases of beer most beers
 
03:49:58.969 --> 03:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
it's not a whole lot of product in other
 
03:49:58.979 --> 03:50:03.830 align:start position:0%
it's not a whole lot of product in other
words

03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
very housekeeping it's pretty minimal
 
03:50:06.960 --> 03:50:09.170 align:start position:0%
very housekeeping it's pretty minimal
yes

03:50:09.170 --> 03:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:50:11.090 --> 03:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:13.610 --> 03:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
look great thank you thanks chairman
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
see anybody else would like to testify
 
03:50:18.650 --> 03:50:18.660 align:start position:0%

03:50:58.370 --> 03:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
yeah take everything take it all
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.650 --> 04:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Senator Murphy what a
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you again thank you Mr
 
04:15:25.969 --> 04:15:25.979 align:start position:0%
chairman it's great to be in front of
 
04:15:27.889 --> 04:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
you again whereas the last bill was
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
extremely simple and straightforward
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is much more complicated
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry for that I can
 
04:15:35.809 --> 04:15:35.819 align:start position:0%
say that was a good time to drink some
 
04:15:38.210 --> 04:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
coffee if you have any uh I've got to
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
explain something called The Jones Act
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
of 1920.
 
04:15:44.450 --> 04:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act was passed in the
 
04:15:46.689 --> 04:15:46.699 align:start position:0%
aftermath of World War One
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
The Merchant Marine fleet was used to
 
04:15:53.530 --> 04:15:53.540 align:start position:0%
transport goods and soldiers
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
to Europe
 
04:15:58.130 --> 04:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
for use in fighting and
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
 
04:16:00.840 --> 04:16:02.389 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
um

04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:03.950 --> 04:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
to his actress passed the Jones act
 
04:16:07.010 --> 04:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
basically says in a nutshell that any
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
ship that is engaging in Commerce from
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
one U.S port to another U.S port
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
must be built in American shipyards must
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
be crewed by American sailors
 
04:16:23.090 --> 04:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
and must be owned by American ship uh
 
04:16:24.650 --> 04:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
shipping interest
 
04:16:24.660 --> 04:16:26.269 align:start position:0%
shipping interest
so

04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
that might have made some sense in 1920
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
at the time we had thousands and
 
04:16:32.870 --> 04:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of ships
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
we had hundreds and hundreds of
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
shipyards across the country
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
today while Japan has over a thousand
 
04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
shipyards and China has over 2 000
 
04:16:42.420 --> 04:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
shipyards and China has over 2 000
shipyards

04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
shipyards
 
04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
we have only seven major shipyards in
 
04:16:48.410 --> 04:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
the United States only one of which
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
builds commercial cargo ships
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
it cost three times more to build a ship
 
04:16:56.150 --> 04:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
here than it does overseas it costs 2.7
 
04:16:59.330 --> 04:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
more times more to operate a U.S flag
 
04:16:59.340 --> 04:17:01.429 align:start position:0%
more times more to operate a U.S flag
vessel

04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
vessel
 
04:17:04.490 --> 04:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
there are as of now
 
04:17:08.090 --> 04:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
less than 200 qualified ships to engage
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
in port to port Commerce the United
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
States the average age is over 30 years
 
04:17:12.600 --> 04:17:13.370 align:start position:0%
States the average age is over 30 years
old

04:17:13.370 --> 04:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
old
 
04:17:15.530 --> 04:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
which is basically at their life
 
04:17:15.540 --> 04:17:16.670 align:start position:0%
which is basically at their life
expectancy

04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
expectancy
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
so when you have
 
04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
a high demand for a service and you have
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
a limited Supply what happens to price
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
it goes up
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
those goods that would be transferred
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
from point to point using water which is
 
04:17:39.530 --> 04:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
actually fairly environmentally friendly
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
has to get pushed onto
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
trains and trucks which are not as
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly so there's two
 
04:17:47.929 --> 04:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
costs to look at here there's the
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
financial cost which we all pay there's
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
so the bill is very simple we're not in
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
a position to
 
04:18:02.150 --> 04:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
Grant waivers as a legislature to the
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
Jones act but we are in a position to
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
come up with a number
 
04:18:09.410 --> 04:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I filed this bill last November
 
04:18:12.229 --> 04:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
December because at the time we were
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
facing extremely high heating oil cost
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
now since then we've had a fairly mild
 
04:18:18.830 --> 04:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
winter and that was lucky it worked out
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
for us
 
04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:18:26.210 --> 04:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to come to a
 
04:18:29.450 --> 04:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
a number for what it costs
 
04:18:31.010 --> 04:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
our citizens
 
04:18:34.250 --> 04:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
for heating oil and energy prices I'd
 
04:18:35.450 --> 04:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
ask the department of energy to
 
04:18:37.010 --> 04:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
calculate that number given existing
 
04:18:37.020 --> 04:18:38.990 align:start position:0%
calculate that number given existing
information

04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:18:40.849 --> 04:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
um for the record the president can
 
04:18:43.010 --> 04:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
grant waivers and has granted waivers to
 
04:18:44.330 --> 04:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
certain States and certain Pro in
 
04:18:46.849 --> 04:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
certain situations Alaska had a waiver
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
at one point when they had difficulty
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
getting gasoline for example in the wake
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
of a hurricane Puerto Rico had a waiver
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
granted so there was there is a
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
possibility to have waivers the idea is
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
that we get this number that gives us
 
04:18:59.279 --> 04:19:00.410 align:start position:0%
that we get this number that gives us
additional

04:19:00.410 --> 04:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
information to push for a waiver for
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
ourselves if that were to happen again
 
04:19:05.880 --> 04:19:07.010 align:start position:0%
ourselves if that were to happen again
so

04:19:07.010 --> 04:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
if I explain the Jones act in enough
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
detail I can certainly I handed out some
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
additional information but I'm happy to
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.899 --> 04:19:50.450 align:start position:0%
 
s

04:19:50.450 --> 04:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.460 --> 04:20:12.170 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:20:12.170 --> 04:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:12.180 --> 04:20:26.330 align:start position:0%
 
state

04:20:26.330 --> 04:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
for the rest of this thing
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
in November the heating oil prices the
 
04:20:33.410 --> 04:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
heating oil difference in price between
 
04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and non-vote
 
04:20:37.020 --> 04:20:38.030 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and non-vote
state

04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:20:40.490 --> 04:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire was 30 seconds the
 
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
difference New Hampshire was five
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and eighty cents a gallon
 
04:20:47.929 --> 04:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
Minnesota was 30 cents less according to
 
04:20:49.849 --> 04:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
the Department of origin
 
04:20:52.250 --> 04:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
a month later they realized that the
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
winter wasn't going to be that bad
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the price brought a dollar a gallon
 
04:20:59.450 --> 04:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
all across everybody and that includes
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
every state in New England
 
04:21:04.729 --> 04:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
Indiana Virginia Delaware Oakland States
 
04:21:06.650 --> 04:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
they're all about a Dollar by December
 
04:21:06.660 --> 04:21:07.849 align:start position:0%
they're all about a Dollar by December
22nd

04:21:07.849 --> 04:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
22nd
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
as of today who gives you phase blessed
 
04:21:13.849 --> 04:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
than Minnesota pays for heating one
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's according to the Department of
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
energy that's a non-vote state versus a
 
04:21:22.370 --> 04:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.490 --> 04:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
so in your in the bill it talks about
 
04:21:29.450 --> 04:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
our high energy prices for heating oil
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
when in fact it is any higher than a
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
state that has no vote
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
and right now it's actually a little bit
 
04:21:37.680 --> 04:21:39.849 align:start position:0%
and right now it's actually a little bit
less

04:21:39.849 --> 04:21:39.859 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
I just want to understand what it is
 
04:21:46.490 --> 04:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
we're looking for here and what the
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
point of all this is when some of the
 
04:21:50.150 --> 04:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
numbers aren't backing up what you're
 
04:21:50.160 --> 04:21:51.849 align:start position:0%
numbers aren't backing up what you're
saying

04:21:51.849 --> 04:21:51.859 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
well I want to congratulate your
 
04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative for uh asking me the
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
longest question I've ever heard in my
 
04:21:59.330 --> 04:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
nine years as a member of this
 
04:21:59.340 --> 04:22:00.590 align:start position:0%
nine years as a member of this
legislature

04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:22:00.600 --> 04:22:04.030 align:start position:0%
legislature
hahaha

04:22:04.030 --> 04:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:04.040 --> 04:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:07.969 --> 04:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
would you believe I understand the gist
 
04:22:10.729 --> 04:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
of your question my hypothesis without
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
pulling out a map is that Minnesota
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
probably has dramatically closer access
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
to oil fields in Canada North Dakota Etc
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
and probably has better pipeline access
 
04:22:22.490 --> 04:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
than we do here in New Hampshire
 
04:22:22.500 --> 04:22:23.330 align:start position:0%
than we do here in New Hampshire
um

04:22:23.330 --> 04:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
oil flows across the country in a number
 
04:22:29.929 --> 04:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
of ways train pipeline shipping Etc and
 
04:22:32.530 --> 04:22:32.540 align:start position:0%
while they may not have boats uh
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
directly in Minnesota they certainly
 
04:22:36.650 --> 04:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
have closer access to the pipe to the
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
oil fields and to Pipelines
 
04:22:42.170 --> 04:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
follow on to that please if you don't
 
04:22:42.180 --> 04:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
follow on to that please if you don't
mind

04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:22:46.610 --> 04:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
I do understand that absolutely
 
04:22:48.290 --> 04:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at is the
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
difference and I do understand our
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline problems what I'm trying to
 
04:22:55.130 --> 04:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
understand is the difference with
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
what the impact is
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the Jones act specifically in this
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
one area which you call out in the bill
 
04:23:07.969 --> 04:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
when in fact it doesn't seem to be
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
the difference that you're calling out
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill is to arrive at
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
the number
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
how can we say there is no impact to the
 
04:23:17.330 --> 04:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
Jones Act without asking the question
 
04:23:24.590 --> 04:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.600 --> 04:23:25.969 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:23:25.969 --> 04:23:25.979 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
as I understand that the Jones Act is a
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
federal act given that how does this
 
04:23:38.090 --> 04:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
study accomplish anything aside from
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
more paper since no matter what the
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
findings would be this legislature would
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
have no authority over the Jones Act
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you that's certainly a very valid
 
04:23:51.290 --> 04:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
question I am not one for make work
 
04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
especially in our busy
 
04:23:55.790 --> 04:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
state agencies
 
04:23:55.800 --> 04:23:58.010 align:start position:0%
state agencies
however

04:23:58.010 --> 04:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
it must drive up the cost of of heating
 
04:24:04.969 --> 04:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
oil and energy prices in some way
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's simply seeking to quantify the cost
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
04:24:14.450 --> 04:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
20 cents a kilowatt hour
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
or five cents a kilowatt hour one cent a
 
04:24:20.290 --> 04:24:20.300 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour it simply seeks to
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
quantify the number
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
there may not be an I mean it's going to
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:31.250 --> 04:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
the idea is that if we have that number
 
04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
and then we're in a position to uh Lobby
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
Washington for our Jones act waiver if
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
we were to have a difficult winter which
 
04:24:42.769 --> 04:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
we luckily managed to avoid but just
 
04:24:46.010 --> 04:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
like you I saw my heating oil prices
 
04:24:49.490 --> 04:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
Spike and my my electric prices
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
Spike that man happened across the state
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
I'm still paying what 22 cents a
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour from eversource right now
 
04:24:58.130 --> 04:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
04:24:58.140 --> 04:24:59.570 align:start position:0%
I believe
so

04:24:59.570 --> 04:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:59.580 --> 04:25:02.090 align:start position:0%
so
anyway

04:25:02.090 --> 04:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
I have net metering so you know just
 
04:25:07.330 --> 04:25:07.340 align:start position:0%
just been bigger checks
 
04:25:09.769 --> 04:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
representative Hammond thank you Mr
 
04:25:12.050 --> 04:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Senator first testifying
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
and taking our questions
 
04:25:13.800 --> 04:25:14.410 align:start position:0%
and taking our questions
um

04:25:14.410 --> 04:25:14.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
understanding that the global oil Market
 
04:25:19.790 --> 04:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
is a large fungible market so that
 
04:25:22.550 --> 04:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
prices uh here impact prices everywhere
 
04:25:25.729 --> 04:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
and vice versa could you explain how the
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
Jones act affects how fuel oil arrives
 
04:25:32.229 --> 04:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
on our Shores
 
04:25:34.570 --> 04:25:34.580 align:start position:0%
it comes from
 
04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
do you understand can you explain to us
 
04:25:40.130 --> 04:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
the uh the route that it takes that it
 
04:25:42.110 --> 04:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise might not if the Jones act
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't in effect thank you for the
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:25:49.729 --> 04:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
let's say oil is produced in Saudi
 
04:25:53.090 --> 04:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
Arabia and then it is transported here
 
04:25:56.689 --> 04:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
to New Jersey where the uh there's many
 
04:25:58.910 --> 04:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
many refineries and it's produced and
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
it's refined in the heating oil at that
 
04:26:00.359 --> 04:26:01.490 align:start position:0%
it's refined in the heating oil at that
location

04:26:01.490 --> 04:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
location
 
04:26:03.889 --> 04:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
it can then not be shipped directly from
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
New Jersey
 
04:26:08.929 --> 04:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
to uh to Boston for uploading and
 
04:26:11.570 --> 04:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
transportation here it's got to go to a
 
04:26:14.410 --> 04:26:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.570 --> 04:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
and that extra time
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
adds cost and that cost is as always
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
passed on to the end consumer American
 
04:26:26.929 --> 04:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
Oil can't be shipped out of uh let's say
 
04:26:26.939 --> 04:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
Oil can't be shipped out of uh let's say
Louisiana

04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
Louisiana
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
and transported to New Jersey for for uh
 
04:26:35.689 --> 04:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
Refinery it must go somewhere else
 
04:26:37.550 --> 04:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
can I answer your question sufficiently
 
04:26:39.969 --> 04:26:39.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah other people have to
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
so represent Burroughs
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
yes Senator thanks for taking my
 
04:26:46.920 --> 04:26:48.110 align:start position:0%
yes Senator thanks for taking my
question

04:26:48.110 --> 04:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
um my question is that you know it's a
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
federal Jones Act is a federal
 
04:26:54.189 --> 04:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
um law
 
04:26:57.769 --> 04:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
and would it be more effective to have a
 
04:26:59.870 --> 04:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
study that combines the New England
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
states rather than having each state do
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
it individually wouldn't it perhaps have
 
04:27:05.809 --> 04:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
more impact on the federal government
 
04:27:08.090 --> 04:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
and looking at this issue
 
04:27:09.410 --> 04:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and that may
 
04:27:10.689 --> 04:27:10.699 align:start position:0%
well be the case
 
04:27:12.769 --> 04:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
the law is targeted towards New
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because that's where we live
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
this is the legislature for New
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's why the the
 
04:27:20.410 --> 04:27:20.420 align:start position:0%
um the bill is written as it is
 
04:27:22.490 --> 04:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
also I think that the department of
 
04:27:25.250 --> 04:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
energy is going to be
 
04:27:27.170 --> 04:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
um it's going to have at its fingertips
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
information specific to New Hampshire
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
and in a way that's easier than say
 
04:27:30.960 --> 04:27:32.210 align:start position:0%
and in a way that's easier than say
information

04:27:32.210 --> 04:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
for the region
 
04:27:35.389 --> 04:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
04:27:37.130 --> 04:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you mentioned that
 
04:27:43.969 --> 04:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
um oil that is shipped from foreign that
 
04:27:43.979 --> 04:27:44.750 align:start position:0%
um oil that is shipped from foreign that
is

04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:27:44.760 --> 04:27:46.370 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:27:46.370 --> 04:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:48.769 --> 04:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
uh comes from oil wells in foreign
 
04:27:48.779 --> 04:27:49.849 align:start position:0%
uh comes from oil wells in foreign
countries

04:27:49.849 --> 04:27:49.859 align:start position:0%
countries
 
04:27:51.889 --> 04:27:51.899 align:start position:0%
um and then a ship for instance to New
 
04:27:53.870 --> 04:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
Jersey and and refined in the oil
 
04:27:55.849 --> 04:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
refineries there
 
04:27:57.769 --> 04:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
um would then have to go to a foreign
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
country before being shipped uh to New
 
04:28:00.960 --> 04:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
country before being shipped uh to New
Hampshire

04:28:01.260 --> 04:28:01.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:28:01.270 --> 04:28:02.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
[Music]

04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:28:04.729 --> 04:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
um but my question is is that in fact
 
04:28:09.469 --> 04:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
true and I ask it because I heard
 
04:28:09.479 --> 04:28:10.330 align:start position:0%
true and I ask it because I heard
um

04:28:10.330 --> 04:28:10.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:12.410 --> 04:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
a speaker
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
um from
 
04:28:15.969 --> 04:28:15.979 align:start position:0%
um a company
 
04:28:19.070 --> 04:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
that does shipping
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
um in and out of uh Portsmouth
 
04:28:26.929 --> 04:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
who uh said that while uh large there
 
04:28:30.170 --> 04:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
are a few to know large tanker vessels
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh that are Jones act qualified that
 
04:28:38.030 --> 04:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
there are in fact many uh barges uh that
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
ship oil from one U.S port to another
 
04:28:45.050 --> 04:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
that our Jones act qualified and then in
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
fact a great deal of oil does come into
 
04:28:52.670 --> 04:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
New England ports in that way via U.S
 
04:28:56.210 --> 04:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:59.649 --> 04:28:59.659 align:start position:0%
there are currently under 200
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
ocean going Jones act compliance ships
 
04:29:07.370 --> 04:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
nine out of 10 U.S built Jones act
 
04:29:09.290 --> 04:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
compliance ships
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
our barges or tugboats
 
04:29:16.610 --> 04:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
when I said that the oil would need to
 
04:29:16.620 --> 04:29:17.630 align:start position:0%
when I said that the oil would need to
go

04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:29:19.130 --> 04:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
to a different
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
nationalities Port after leaving the
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
United States Port of course that was
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that it was not a Joanne Jones
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
act compliant ships the problem is
 
04:29:28.429 --> 04:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
there's just not that many of those
 
04:29:29.830 --> 04:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
ships left
 
04:29:32.570 --> 04:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
there were some and yes some of them do
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
offload import and Portsmouth if there
 
04:29:36.410 --> 04:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
were more there'd be more competition
 
04:29:42.410 --> 04:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.420 --> 04:29:44.750 align:start position:0%
 
River

04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
River
 
04:29:46.969 --> 04:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
okay you know that well
 
04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
who was the question representative
 
04:29:49.080 --> 04:29:54.170 align:start position:0%
who was the question representative
Herbert

04:29:54.170 --> 04:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
um this is an interesting conversation
 
04:29:57.649 --> 04:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
because I didn't I didn't even know what
 
04:30:01.849 --> 04:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act was but uh I do know that
 
04:30:01.859 --> 04:30:04.670 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act was but uh I do know that
geopolitically

04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
geopolitically
 
04:30:08.210 --> 04:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
the cost of energy went up everywhere
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
yes uh primarily I think because of the
 
04:30:11.279 --> 04:30:12.830 align:start position:0%
yes uh primarily I think because of the
Ukrainian

04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
Ukrainian
 
04:30:12.840 --> 04:30:14.450 align:start position:0%
Ukrainian
issue

04:30:14.450 --> 04:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:30:16.429 --> 04:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
but if if
 
04:30:16.439 --> 04:30:18.290 align:start position:0%
but if if
um

04:30:18.290 --> 04:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
could we ask or use this information say
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
for example to requests from the doe or
 
04:30:26.889 --> 04:30:26.899 align:start position:0%
or maybe even the Biden Administration
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
that there would be a waiver allowed
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
so that we could build more ships or or
 
04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
take our boats and we already export a
 
04:30:38.450 --> 04:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
lot of oil
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
and and LNG and everything I don't know
 
04:30:44.330 --> 04:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
what those ships are but um
 
04:30:46.130 --> 04:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
because they're going to foreign ports
 
04:30:48.769 --> 04:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
so that's okay right under the under the
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
Jones law that doesn't matter that
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter that would be okay but
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
think think about the intelligence of
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
this we're offloading U.S oil putting it
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
on ships saying you can't deliver this
 
04:31:00.170 --> 04:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
to a U.S Port we've got to go to a
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
different country's Port meanwhile those
 
04:31:03.649 --> 04:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
ships are coming out of Europe and
 
04:31:05.090 --> 04:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
unloading because those are the only
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
ones that can do it really other than
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
the few handful of ships that are Jones
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
act compliant right it just drives up
 
04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
the cost of transport transporting the
 
04:31:13.140 --> 04:31:15.769 align:start position:0%
the cost of transport transporting the
oil

04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.779 --> 04:31:16.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:31:16.370 --> 04:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
so to answer your first part of the
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
question uh the idea is yes I mean the
 
04:31:22.490 --> 04:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
governor did request A Jones act
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
exemption back the beginning of uh the
 
04:31:27.290 --> 04:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
winter it was not granted
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but this would be additional
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
additional uh arrow in his quiver who
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
did he ask he asked the body
 
04:31:34.189 --> 04:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
Administration that's they're the only
 
04:31:35.809 --> 04:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
ones who can do it
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
well I thought I thought we'd
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
we can request the waiver but they're
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
the only ones that can consider it and
 
04:31:44.090 --> 04:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
Grant it
 
04:31:44.100 --> 04:31:44.990 align:start position:0%
Grant it
okay

04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:31:49.490 --> 04:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.500 --> 04:31:51.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:31:51.950 --> 04:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
this may be a would you believe
 
04:31:58.610 --> 04:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
um but this isn't a partisan issue uh
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
this putting the Jones act under
 
04:32:02.689 --> 04:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
scrutiny I'm just going to read a quote
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
here from uh Chris Pappas who's our one
 
04:32:07.490 --> 04:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
of our congressman and he said I have
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
thought about this and I would support a
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
waiver for the Jones act to make sure
 
04:32:11.929 --> 04:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
our energy needs are met this winter
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why if we've got the
 
04:32:16.250 --> 04:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
resources here in our own country we
 
04:32:18.050 --> 04:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using that to fuel our
 
04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
homes and businesses this winter so
 
04:32:21.410 --> 04:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's something I know the new New
 
04:32:23.090 --> 04:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
England Governors have called for I
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
support that as well so our federal
 
04:32:26.689 --> 04:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
delegation might have a little more
 
04:32:28.250 --> 04:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
power to
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
change the current status quo and the
 
04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
number that you're requesting would you
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
believe might give him another arrow in
 
04:32:36.290 --> 04:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
his quiver as well thank you for the
 
04:32:39.290 --> 04:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
question sir I do believe that
 
04:32:39.300 --> 04:32:40.910 align:start position:0%
question sir I do believe that
representative

04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
very short
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the cost for an
 
04:32:49.610 --> 04:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
oil spill for a ship that does not have
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
the standards of a U.S manufactured ship
 
04:32:55.969 --> 04:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
would far outweigh the savings that
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:06.109 --> 04:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that a foreign
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
crude and built vessel would be
 
04:33:10.609 --> 04:33:10.619 align:start position:0%
immensely more likely to have an oil
 
04:33:14.689 --> 04:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up further question Engler
 
04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
that is not the case
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:33:25.010 --> 04:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
without seeing a study that says that or
 
04:33:27.230 --> 04:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of information backing it up
 
04:33:27.240 --> 04:33:28.730 align:start position:0%
some sort of information backing it up
no

04:33:28.730 --> 04:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
04:33:34.250 --> 04:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for taking my question I'm
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
just curious what uh it's going to be
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
the department of energy that's in
 
04:33:39.769 --> 04:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
charge of figuring this out do you know
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
like So when you say committee is it
 
04:33:43.810 --> 04:33:43.820 align:start position:0%
going to have senators and
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
representatives on it or is it just
 
04:33:47.449 --> 04:33:47.459 align:start position:0%
they're going to be tasked with figuring
 
04:33:49.810 --> 04:33:49.820 align:start position:0%
it out and do you know if they have the
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate skill set within their
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
Department to figure that out in a
 
04:33:56.810 --> 04:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
believable way thank you for the
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
question there's no committee or
 
04:34:00.529 --> 04:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
commission that's intended by the
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislation or contemplated by
 
04:34:01.920 --> 04:34:03.709 align:start position:0%
legislation or contemplated by
legislation

04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:34:05.330 --> 04:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
um it is the Department of energy you
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
should all submit a report to the
 
04:34:09.051 --> 04:34:09.061 align:start position:0%
legislature so there are many qualified
 
04:34:11.090 --> 04:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
and talented economists that work for
 
04:34:12.890 --> 04:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
the state and they would be tasked with
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
coming up with that number which would
 
04:34:17.929 --> 04:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
be reported to us the assumption is they
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't actually do it they would be
 
04:34:20.929 --> 04:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
contracting out for someone else to do
 
04:34:20.939 --> 04:34:22.189 align:start position:0%
contracting out for someone else to do
it

04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can tuck that into the
 
04:34:27.719 --> 04:34:30.369 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can tuck that into the
budget

04:34:30.369 --> 04:34:30.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
well I just wonder if I can
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:41.570 --> 04:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
it was that was my question I was going
 
04:34:47.449 --> 04:34:47.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
I just beat you to it
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions CNN thank you
 
04:34:54.769 --> 04:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
very much thank you sir
 
04:34:58.250 --> 04:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay we have uh Griffin Roberts from the
 
04:35:02.631 --> 04:35:02.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
and he takes uh no position he found a
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman uh Griffin
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
Roberge strategy program manager at the
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy
 
04:35:41.330 --> 04:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
earlier today or I should say yesterday
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
uh submitted our written testimony
 
04:35:47.150 --> 04:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
online via the house uh testimony portal
 
04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh providing paper copies around should
 
04:35:51.769 --> 04:35:51.779 align:start position:0%
be making their way around the committee
 
04:35:51.779 --> 04:35:53.090 align:start position:0%
be making their way around the committee
table

04:35:53.090 --> 04:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
table
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
um again uh from the Department of
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
energy we the department is neutral on
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's amended by the Senate
 
04:36:02.570 --> 04:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
our letter of testimony provides quite a
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
bit of background from a very high level
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
as to the dependency of the region on
 
04:36:11.449 --> 04:36:11.459 align:start position:0%
natural gas as a source for producing
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
the uh producing the energy that to meet
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
our daily demands
 
04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
um as is outlined in our layer of
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
testimony in general most of New
 
04:36:22.730 --> 04:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
England's natural gas arrives via
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
pipelines New Hampshire's natural gas
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
utilities unitel and Liberty typically
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
have firm contracts to receive natural
 
04:36:33.410 --> 04:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
gas supply from those pipelines and
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
natural gas electricity generators have
 
04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
to buy gas from the unused portion of
 
04:36:40.970 --> 04:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
these get of these pipelines
 
04:36:44.090 --> 04:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
um which can become quite Limited in the
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
winter months as I'm sure we're all
 
04:36:45.840 --> 04:36:46.869 align:start position:0%
winter months as I'm sure we're all
aware

04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
aware
 
04:36:49.490 --> 04:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
straining that available pipeline
 
04:36:51.890 --> 04:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
capacity can lead to price spikes during
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
gas system constraints and can lead to
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
peaking power stations such as Merrimack
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
station down the road and bow a coal
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
plant and other oil generators to come
 
04:37:03.890 --> 04:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
online during those peaking periods to
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
meet that increasing demand
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
obviously as I mentioned the region is
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
heavily dependent on natural gas for its
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
energy demand a solution to this might
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
be creating additional pipeline capacity
 
04:37:19.131 --> 04:37:19.141 align:start position:0%
into the region to meet that growing
 
04:37:21.890 --> 04:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
demand but as I as I think we're all
 
04:37:24.769 --> 04:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
aware here citing those pipelines can be
 
04:37:27.410 --> 04:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
significantly challenging not only in
 
04:37:29.529 --> 04:37:29.539 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but in other states where
 
04:37:32.209 --> 04:37:32.219 align:start position:0%
States establish policies that make it
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
difficult to cite additional pipeline
 
04:37:37.369 --> 04:37:37.379 align:start position:0%
infrastructure another way to get
 
04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
natural gas into the region is through
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
shipping tankers that carry liquefied
 
04:37:43.570 --> 04:37:43.580 align:start position:0%
natural gas or LNG
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
these LNG tankers will typically come
 
04:37:48.109 --> 04:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
into Boston to help backfill the region
 
04:37:51.410 --> 04:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
with extra natural gas to meet growing
 
04:37:51.420 --> 04:37:52.269 align:start position:0%
with extra natural gas to meet growing
demand

04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
demand
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
however as has been mentioned the
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant Marine Act of 1920 also known
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
as the Jones act impedes the ability of
 
04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
the region to to get to get that
 
04:38:03.289 --> 04:38:03.299 align:start position:0%
domestically produced liquefied natural
 
04:38:05.689 --> 04:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
gas by tanker this is what brings us to
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
the bill here today
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
um as has been mentioned the Jones act
 
04:38:11.449 --> 04:38:11.459 align:start position:0%
really is a protectionist federal
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
statute that requires LNG tankers that
 
04:38:18.189 --> 04:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
travel between U.S ports to be built
 
04:38:20.810 --> 04:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
owned and operated or I should say
 
04:38:23.209 --> 04:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
flagged by Americans and American
 
04:38:25.369 --> 04:38:25.379 align:start position:0%
companies this means that New England
 
04:38:28.010 --> 04:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
cannot receive any domestically produced
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
LNG from places such as Texas or
 
04:38:34.730 --> 04:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania by ship in essence the
 
04:38:37.730 --> 04:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
Jones act precludes all U.S produced LNG
 
04:38:39.410 --> 04:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
from being delivered to New England
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
unless it's carried on an American ship
 
04:38:44.449 --> 04:38:44.459 align:start position:0%
that again is built owned and operated
 
04:38:46.570 --> 04:38:46.580 align:start position:0%
by Americans and American companies
 
04:38:49.970 --> 04:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
while the U.S is the largest exporter of
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
LNG there are no Jones at compliant LNG
 
04:38:54.551 --> 04:38:54.561 align:start position:0%
tankers that are available
 
04:38:58.250 --> 04:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
no LNG tankers have been built in the
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
U.S since roughly the late 1970s into
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
the 1980s
 
04:39:03.000 --> 04:39:03.590 align:start position:0%
the 1980s
um

04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:05.449 --> 04:39:05.459 align:start position:0%
based on the cursory review I think
 
04:39:08.209 --> 04:39:08.219 align:start position:0%
there's around roughly 12 LNG tankers
 
04:39:10.010 --> 04:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
that were constructed in U.S ports
 
04:39:13.609 --> 04:39:13.619 align:start position:0%
between 77 and 80 that could potentially
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
be reflagged and recrued to become Jones
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
at compliant however all of those ships
 
04:39:20.449 --> 04:39:20.459 align:start position:0%
are currently flagged for other
 
04:39:20.459 --> 04:39:21.551 align:start position:0%
are currently flagged for other
countries

04:39:21.551 --> 04:39:21.561 align:start position:0%
countries
 
04:39:24.051 --> 04:39:24.061 align:start position:0%
additionally most LNG tankers as has
 
04:39:26.810 --> 04:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
been mentioned are produced in foreign
 
04:39:29.150 --> 04:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
countries at cheaper cost they're not
 
04:39:31.250 --> 04:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
produced here because the costs are
 
04:39:31.260 --> 04:39:32.510 align:start position:0%
produced here because the costs are
higher

04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:39:32.520 --> 04:39:33.170 align:start position:0%
higher
um

04:39:33.170 --> 04:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
this tends to leave New England
 
04:39:37.788 --> 04:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
dependent on foreign liquefied natural
 
04:39:40.250 --> 04:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
gas Imports primarily I'm not sure if
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee is familiar
 
04:39:43.130 --> 04:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
with it but there's a little island off
 
04:39:45.410 --> 04:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
the coast of I believe Venezuela called
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago
 
04:39:50.208 --> 04:39:50.218 align:start position:0%
you might not believe it but they're a
 
04:39:51.410 --> 04:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
very small island but they're one of the
 
04:39:54.130 --> 04:39:54.140 align:start position:0%
largest LNG producers in the world and
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
they typically ship most of their stuff
 
04:39:58.810 --> 04:39:58.820 align:start position:0%
here to the U.S
 
04:40:01.610 --> 04:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
major geopolitical events as has been
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned like Russia's invasion of the
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
Ukraine have seen LNG tankers being sent
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
typically to Europe to meet their
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
growing energy demand because Russia has
 
04:40:14.630 --> 04:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
suspended its energy exports over to
 
04:40:16.368 --> 04:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
um over to Europe during this at this
 
04:40:19.010 --> 04:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
time again these geopolitical events
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
have caused significant turmoil
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
um in global energy markets and again as
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned um in July of last
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
year New England's Governors including
 
04:40:29.448 --> 04:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu sent a letter to the U.S
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy asking the Biden
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
Administration to explore suspending the
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
Jones act for the winter for this past
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
winter these Governors met with with a
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
U.S department of energy secretary
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
Jennifer granholm in September of last
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
year and while the administration
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
indicated its continuing approach to
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
enhance its partnership with the region
 
04:40:53.090 --> 04:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
no waiver from the Jones act was issued
 
04:40:53.100 --> 04:40:53.690 align:start position:0%
no waiver from the Jones act was issued
um

04:40:53.690 --> 04:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:55.368 --> 04:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
like to turn back a little bit to the
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill I know I've gone off course here
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
but the bill requires the department of
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
energy to produce a report to the
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
legislature on the estimated impact of
 
04:41:05.208 --> 04:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
the Jones act on New Hampshire's heating
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
fuel and energy market and the bill
 
04:41:09.170 --> 04:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
requires the report to be completed by
 
04:41:12.890 --> 04:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
June 1 of 2024. while the department is
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill we would like to see
 
04:41:16.010 --> 04:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
three amendments to the bill should it
 
04:41:17.570 --> 04:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the first as is seen in the back of
 
04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
the last page of my letter of testimony
 
04:41:22.920 --> 04:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
the last page of my letter of testimony
um

04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
the current bill reads that the
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
department shall report on the estimated
 
04:41:31.128 --> 04:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
impact of the Jones act estimated impact
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
in our opinion is quite broad are we
 
04:41:35.330 --> 04:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
looking at a social impact an economic
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
impact a political impact based on at
 
04:41:39.948 --> 04:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
least all the discussion here today I
 
04:41:41.628 --> 04:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
believe that the the approach is to get
 
04:41:43.850 --> 04:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
an economic analysis so we'd suggest
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
putting the word economic in there to
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
make that abundantly clear we'd also
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the report date being
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
extended from June 1 of 2024 to January
 
04:41:56.570 --> 04:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
1 of 2025 to give us the means to
 
04:41:58.850 --> 04:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
produce an adequate report and then
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
finally as I know has been mentioned in
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
the previous uh testimony the department
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
would appreciate a 250 000 appropriation
 
04:42:09.410 --> 04:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
in this bill in order to complete that
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
report the reason being is that we would
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
need that appropriation to retain the
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
services of an outside consultant to
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
complete this report the department does
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
not have currently in-house resources
 
04:42:22.730 --> 04:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
who are overly knowledgeable about the
 
04:42:25.250 --> 04:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
Jones act and it's specific economic
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
impacts to the state retaining an
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
outside consultant with this
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation would allow us to have the
 
04:42:33.288 --> 04:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
means to conduct an in-depth detailed
 
04:42:35.030 --> 04:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
economic analysis that is New Hampshire
 
04:42:37.610 --> 04:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
Centric Beyond just a simple literary
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
review of existing studies resources and
 
04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
that type of thing that are currently
 
04:42:43.788 --> 04:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
available which again may not be
 
04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
specific to New Hampshire and with that
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
I think obviously in my five minutes on
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
the pink card I'm done I'll take any
 
04:42:50.280 --> 04:42:53.690 align:start position:0%
the pink card I'm done I'll take any
questions

04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.700 --> 04:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:42:58.368 --> 04:42:58.378 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
04:43:00.770 --> 04:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:43:02.208 --> 04:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:43:04.730 --> 04:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to get my head around
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
what sounds to me like a very
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
complicated uh problem but if my my
 
04:43:13.128 --> 04:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
understanding is under the Jones Act
 
04:43:15.890 --> 04:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh an LNG tanker can go from New Orleans
 
04:43:15.900 --> 04:43:17.330 align:start position:0%
uh an LNG tanker can go from New Orleans
to

04:43:17.330 --> 04:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:21.530 --> 04:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
but what happens then is it got to come
 
04:43:25.730 --> 04:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
back empty sure
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
just so thank you for the question so
 
04:43:31.368 --> 04:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is really an intra ra
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
national federal statute is that it
 
04:43:37.128 --> 04:43:37.138 align:start position:0%
requires Goods such as LNG
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
um that are being shipped between U.S
 
04:43:41.930 --> 04:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
ports need to be constructed on need to
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
be ships that are owned operated and
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
built by Americans and American
 
04:43:45.180 --> 04:43:46.670 align:start position:0%
built by Americans and American
companies

04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:43:46.680 --> 04:43:47.628 align:start position:0%
companies
um

04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
this pre as I mentioned it precludes any
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
type of domestically produced LNG uh
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
that's produced here in America say from
 
04:43:56.570 --> 04:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
like Texas or Pennsylvania from being
 
04:43:58.368 --> 04:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
shipped from those areas all the way up
 
04:44:00.770 --> 04:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
here to Boston and into the region so as
 
04:44:03.050 --> 04:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the region at those times of
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
high constraint are dependent on foreign
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
exports made from to your point say
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
Spain to Boston to provide that LNG or
 
04:44:14.090 --> 04:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
in reality Trinidad and Tobago there are
 
04:44:16.368 --> 04:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
instances where and it's certainly the
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
case where a lot of the domestically
 
04:44:20.448 --> 04:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
produced LNG say in Texas or
 
04:44:22.010 --> 04:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania are currently being put on
 
04:44:24.890 --> 04:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
a ship sent to Europe and that can be
 
04:44:26.570 --> 04:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
done through contracts at those private
 
04:44:28.030 --> 04:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
companies make and everything like that
 
04:44:30.830 --> 04:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to accessing
 
04:44:32.810 --> 04:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
domestically produced LNG and
 
04:44:35.150 --> 04:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
transporting it by tanker that's where
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
you trigger the Jones act that's where
 
04:44:38.330 --> 04:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
those ships fall under the protection of
 
04:44:38.340 --> 04:44:40.070 align:start position:0%
those ships fall under the protection of
statue

04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
statue
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully that makes sense
 
04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
it helps representative Ammon
 
04:44:47.090 --> 04:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
our questions I have two related
 
04:44:49.560 --> 04:44:50.390 align:start position:0%
our questions I have two related
questions

04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:44:50.400 --> 04:44:51.110 align:start position:0%
questions
um

04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the LNG that we use
 
04:44:57.050 --> 04:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
in our Market is shipped versus piped
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
that's first question sure that that's a
 
04:45:01.310 --> 04:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
very good question I don't have that I
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't have that um that data available
 
04:45:05.628 --> 04:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
now but
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't answer your immediate question
 
04:45:09.770 --> 04:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
but overall the region its dependency on
 
04:45:12.288 --> 04:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
natural gas the region as a whole
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
typically depends about 50 of its
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
overall energy portfolio is staked in
 
04:45:18.890 --> 04:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
natural gas so again when a region is
 
04:45:23.030 --> 04:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
highly dependent on one type of fuel for
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
its energy and then demand grows and
 
04:45:27.410 --> 04:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
Supply doesn't meet that demand you're
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to see those price spikes that
 
04:45:31.010 --> 04:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
increase demand and we want to get more
 
04:45:33.890 --> 04:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
natural gas into the region I can
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
certainly look into that a little bit
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up with the committee but there's
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
a real specific answers today and
 
04:45:40.128 --> 04:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
follow-up for the question and this is
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
just from my own curiosity
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
natural gas in the winter time
 
04:45:47.448 --> 04:45:47.458 align:start position:0%
we rely on it to generate electricity
 
04:45:49.970 --> 04:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
and people also rely on it to heat their
 
04:45:49.980 --> 04:45:50.868 align:start position:0%
and people also rely on it to heat their
homes

04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
and isn't there a rule if my memory
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
serves as a rule that says the natural
 
04:45:59.208 --> 04:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
gas has to be prioritized for heating of
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
homes over electric generation that's
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
correct and then when that happens all
 
04:46:05.330 --> 04:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
their sources have to have to come
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
online to the coal and the oil that you
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier has to fill in that's
 
04:46:12.170 --> 04:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
correct so typical as you mentioned um
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh what is it a natural gas pipeline
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
capacity is prioritized for Natural Gas
 
04:46:20.030 --> 04:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
Utilities like Liberty like unitel who
 
04:46:21.530 --> 04:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
provide that natural gas for home
 
04:46:21.540 --> 04:46:23.090 align:start position:0%
provide that natural gas for home
heating

04:46:23.090 --> 04:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
heating
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
um any excess capacity that's available
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
on those pipelines is bought up by
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Electric producers who or I should say
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
electricity generators who use the
 
04:46:33.288 --> 04:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
natural gas to produce electricity for
 
04:46:35.650 --> 04:46:35.660 align:start position:0%
the region when there's not enough
 
04:46:38.150 --> 04:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
and there's limited again there's
 
04:46:40.128 --> 04:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
strained pipeline capacity that's where
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
you get to that point where you have you
 
04:46:43.490 --> 04:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
start having those price spikes that
 
04:46:46.490 --> 04:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
limited Supply and that's we have
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
power plants come online they're
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
typically that typically only operate
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
during these peaking periods such as
 
04:46:54.288 --> 04:46:54.298 align:start position:0%
Merrimack station or oil facilities
 
04:46:55.850 --> 04:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
around the region that come online to
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
help meet that growing demand
 
04:47:00.410 --> 04:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:47:02.208 --> 04:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
and so if I'm understanding this quickly
 
04:47:04.788 --> 04:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
if there's a constraint in the shipped
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
during those Peak periods it forces us
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
to use more oil and coal to fill in the
 
04:47:16.368 --> 04:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:18.170 --> 04:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
04:47:21.288 --> 04:47:21.298 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you heard me mention
 
04:47:21.298 --> 04:47:22.670 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you heard me mention
earlier

04:47:22.670 --> 04:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:47:26.110 --> 04:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
um uh someone from the New Hampshire
 
04:47:29.330 --> 04:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
barge and Tugboat industry
 
04:47:33.890 --> 04:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
um uh having discussed how oil is
 
04:47:36.590 --> 04:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
shipped by barges from one U.S port to
 
04:47:38.990 --> 04:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
another uh in a way that complies with
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is this done or could this
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
be done also for liquefied natural gas
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
that is could liquefied it is liquefied
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas or could liquefied natural
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
gas also be shipped by barges or does
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
that have to be shipped by larger
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
tankers sure and thank you for the
 
04:47:56.638 --> 04:47:57.530 align:start position:0%
tankers sure and thank you for the
question

04:47:57.530 --> 04:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:47:59.448 --> 04:47:59.458 align:start position:0%
um I believe if any type of liquefied
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
natural gas is to be shipped again
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
International within within the space of
 
04:48:07.010 --> 04:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
U.S port to U.S Port it must be Jones
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
act compliant now could there potential
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm certainly not an engineer but
 
04:48:13.128 --> 04:48:13.138 align:start position:0%
could there potentially be an LNG tanker
 
04:48:17.090 --> 04:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's retrofitted and and to be Jones
 
04:48:19.368 --> 04:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
act compliant potential but I imagine
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
that might be cost prohibitive to do so
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
further question thank you uh sorry that
 
04:48:26.990 --> 04:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't my question sure
 
04:48:29.448 --> 04:48:29.458 align:start position:0%
um okay apparently there are barges
 
04:48:32.810 --> 04:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
operating now that are
 
04:48:36.288 --> 04:48:36.298 align:start position:0%
Jones act compliant that ship oil from
 
04:48:38.930 --> 04:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
one U.S port to another
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
are there also barges that
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
are Jones act compliant that ship
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
liquefied natural gas from one U.S port
 
04:48:52.490 --> 04:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
to another or if there aren't could
 
04:48:54.830 --> 04:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
there be is that does that make sense
 
04:48:57.230 --> 04:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah sure that makes sense so uh are
 
04:48:57.240 --> 04:48:58.010 align:start position:0%
yeah sure that makes sense so uh are
there

04:48:58.010 --> 04:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:49:00.530 --> 04:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
potentially but again we're not
 
04:49:02.810 --> 04:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
typically seeing that could there be I
 
04:49:04.368 --> 04:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
could I could say yes but again they
 
04:49:07.850 --> 04:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:10.970 --> 04:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh sorry can I follow up one more time
 
04:49:13.010 --> 04:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
last time I promise
 
04:49:16.430 --> 04:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:18.830 --> 04:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay just for clarification they're
 
04:49:18.840 --> 04:49:21.470 align:start position:0%
okay just for clarification they're
currently

04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
are no such barges or at least hardly
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
any such bar just for liquefied natural
 
04:49:26.520 --> 04:49:28.128 align:start position:0%
any such bar just for liquefied natural
gas

04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
gas
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
um but if there were to be some they
 
04:49:32.810 --> 04:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
would have to be Jones act compliant
 
04:49:35.690 --> 04:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
um but that could be done it just hasn't
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
been done yet correct
 
04:49:39.650 --> 04:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
so I will let you go but I guess I I
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
have a question that it affects some of
 
04:49:47.868 --> 04:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
us that live in Cheshire County
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
um in which city of Keene actually has
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
this gas trucked in and uh the story I
 
04:49:56.570 --> 04:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
heard and then you can tell me where
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
this is true or not the gas is coming
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
from the Midwest by Pipeline and makes
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
it all the way to New York uh just on
 
04:50:06.350 --> 04:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
the other side of the Hudson River and
 
04:50:08.930 --> 04:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
then it's loaded up by truck and driven
 
04:50:11.930 --> 04:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
across this insane route route 9 through
 
04:50:15.170 --> 04:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
Vermont and delivered to us in Cheshire
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
county so is that true that that's how
 
04:50:21.410 --> 04:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
we get our gas uh well thank you for the
 
04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
question I can't comment specifically on
 
04:50:25.730 --> 04:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
that but I would say it doesn't broadly
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
on on the broad end I would say it's not
 
04:50:30.288 --> 04:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
surprising just because New England as a
 
04:50:32.930 --> 04:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
region is at the tail end of the
 
04:50:35.690 --> 04:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
national energy Supply you know we're
 
04:50:37.610 --> 04:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
not a Texas we're not
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
um we're not Texas we're not
 
04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania where we have abundant
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
access to natural gas reserves sitting
 
04:50:43.550 --> 04:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
below our feet
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of it needs to be
 
04:50:46.490 --> 04:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
trucked up here or sent up here and
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
again when they're isn't that sufficient
 
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
pipeline capacity to get it up here
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's going to be other means to do so
 
04:50:54.410 --> 04:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
such as truck train if there's you know
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
a ship to do so making sure it's Jones
 
04:50:58.368 --> 04:50:58.378 align:start position:0%
act compliant if it's shipped between
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
U.S ports so I would say anecdotally
 
04:51:04.010 --> 04:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
maybe I but again I just I can't confirm
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
the the details well the reason I say
 
04:51:07.788 --> 04:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
that is because even if we were to to
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get more chips in yet
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
near us how much will really benefit uh
 
04:51:16.010 --> 04:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire
 
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
in particular because we don't have such
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
a big Port yeah sure to get that access
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
I always thought Providence was was a
 
04:51:25.850 --> 04:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
big Port I think I one time used to see
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
this natural gas tankers pull in there
 
04:51:29.868 --> 04:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
but I don't even I hear they don't even
 
04:51:32.090 --> 04:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
do that anymore sure and I mean one the
 
04:51:34.250 --> 04:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
reason they typically land in in Boston
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
is because there's a massive electric
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
generator there called Mystic station
 
04:51:40.850 --> 04:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
and it is based and it runs on natural
 
04:51:43.250 --> 04:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
gas so looking for natural gas comes in
 
04:51:46.128 --> 04:51:46.138 align:start position:0%
goes into the the facility produces
 
04:51:48.890 --> 04:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
electricity to meet the growing demand
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
um again during those again we're just
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
talking about those Peak periods in the
 
04:51:54.770 --> 04:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
winter where energy demand is at its
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
highest that's where you start getting
 
04:51:58.610 --> 04:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
that constraint and available pipeline
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
currency and yeah that crunch leads to
 
04:52:02.690 --> 04:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
price spikes because there's growing
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
demand not not
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
supplies not meeting that demandation
 
04:52:10.330 --> 04:52:10.340 align:start position:0%
got it thank you
 
04:52:13.368 --> 04:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
pillow thank you uh thank you for taking
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
my question thank you the um are
 
04:52:15.840 --> 04:52:17.330 align:start position:0%
my question thank you the um are
Renewables

04:52:17.330 --> 04:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
Renewables
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
um could Renewables be a part of this
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
conversation or not because in New
 
04:52:24.430 --> 04:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we seem to kind of ignore
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
Renewables as an alternative source of
 
04:52:28.730 --> 04:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
sure and and thank you for the question
 
04:52:30.890 --> 04:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
so certainly Renewables are a growing
 
04:52:32.570 --> 04:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
part I would say
 
04:52:36.590 --> 04:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
um of the Region's uh fuel mix
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
um natural you know everything's got to
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
equal 100 on the pie chart and so if one
 
04:52:42.170 --> 04:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
goes away something else is going to
 
04:52:43.490 --> 04:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
take its place
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
um certainly and these are discussions
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
we often have frequently in the house st
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
e committee but you know
 
04:52:50.030 --> 04:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of federal money coming
 
04:52:51.770 --> 04:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
down the pike as well
 
04:52:53.208 --> 04:52:53.218 align:start position:0%
um to advance renewable energy either
 
04:52:54.770 --> 04:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
through the inflation reduction act or
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
the uh infrastructure investment in jobs
 
04:52:57.420 --> 04:52:58.730 align:start position:0%
the uh infrastructure investment in jobs
act

04:52:58.730 --> 04:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
act
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I would say yes
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
simply thanks
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:53:09.288 --> 04:53:09.298 align:start position:0%
This concerns excuse me the proposed
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to the first one changing the
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
estimated impact to the estimated
 
04:53:15.890 --> 04:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
economic impact and that's certainly an
 
04:53:17.628 --> 04:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
improvement over the word impact which
 
04:53:19.550 --> 04:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I know what that means but
 
04:53:23.270 --> 04:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
equally so economic impact is fairly
 
04:53:26.030 --> 04:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
broad can you apply on what economic
 
04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
impact means and what it would involve
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
studying economic impact sure and thank
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
you for the question so um I would agree
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
with you though as as is noted in our in
 
04:53:36.830 --> 04:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
our testimony the phrase estimated
 
04:53:39.410 --> 04:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
impact is quite broad having it narrowed
 
04:53:41.810 --> 04:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
down to the economic impacts from the
 
04:53:44.930 --> 04:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
Jones act on New Hampshire's uh heating
 
04:53:46.910 --> 04:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
fuel and energy markets would would
 
04:53:49.368 --> 04:53:49.378 align:start position:0%
offer the department more specificity
 
04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
than it was currently in the bill
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I can't opine on specifically
 
04:53:57.410 --> 04:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm certainly not an economist right
 
04:54:00.530 --> 04:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
or by any measure but I imagine the
 
04:54:01.970 --> 04:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to go forward with
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
an appropriation we retain an outside
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
consultant that study would look at you
 
04:54:09.530 --> 04:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
know you know maybe episodes in the past
 
04:54:12.890 --> 04:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
of of uh past periods where energy
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
demand spiked and prices went along with
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
it if say more LNG came in by tanker
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
would there be a requisite uh price drop
 
04:54:23.570 --> 04:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
or anything like that that's maybe one
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
aspect that might be looked at in the
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
report it might also look at
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
um you know the costs of of not doing
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
anything regarding this or regarding
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
um more liquefied natural gas coming in
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
by tanker that type of thing
 
04:54:39.410 --> 04:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to you think that it
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
would also look at if for example issues
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
related to the economic or excuse me the
 
04:54:46.970 --> 04:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
employment and labor aspects of the oil
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
and gas industry in New Hampshire or
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
factors related to the economic impact
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the Jones act and its potential
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
effects on National Security both in New
 
04:54:56.330 --> 04:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and New England are those
 
04:54:57.890 --> 04:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
factors that are within the Department's
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
capacity to research okay and thank you
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
again I would submit that we would love
 
04:55:05.448 --> 04:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
to have an outside consultant into that
 
04:55:07.970 --> 04:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
um but again you know uh based on at
 
04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
least testimony we've heard you know I
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
think the Genesis of the the focus of
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
the bills to look at economic impact
 
04:55:14.810 --> 04:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
obviously the legislature can determine
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
what they want State departments to look
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
at in various reports if there's further
 
04:55:20.810 --> 04:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
information that you that this committee
 
04:55:23.090 --> 04:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
wanted the report to look at certainly
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
spell that out
 
04:55:25.970 --> 04:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
um in the in the bill and we'd
 
04:55:28.610 --> 04:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate specificity on that
 
04:55:31.250 --> 04:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
more detail the better yes
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you uh
 
04:55:37.090 --> 04:55:37.100 align:start position:0%
chair Recon representative Yuri polzo
 
04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.820 --> 04:55:45.340 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:55:45.340 --> 04:55:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:53.170 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:55:53.170 --> 04:55:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:57.490 --> 04:55:57.500 align:start position:0%
I was very excited when Senator Murphy
 
04:56:01.550 --> 04:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill as you heard in this
 
04:56:04.850 --> 04:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
testimony all our constituents paying
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
higher prices for energy and it's uh
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
important to investigate this I see it's
 
04:56:17.770 --> 04:56:17.780 align:start position:0%
John's act as it is
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
very insulting to our middle time
 
04:56:24.650 --> 04:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
industry because our other Industries
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
are competing in some way like in Auto
 
04:56:33.170 --> 04:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
Auto industry Ford and Tesla produced in
 
04:56:36.368 --> 04:56:36.378 align:start position:0%
the US successfully compete with
 
04:56:39.850 --> 04:56:39.860 align:start position:0%
vehicles for example produced in Mexico
 
04:56:42.890 --> 04:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
in Aerospace
 
04:56:45.970 --> 04:56:45.980 align:start position:0%
and competes with European
 
04:56:49.850 --> 04:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
producers of Civilian aircrafts and so
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
on so I'm totally optimistic
 
04:56:56.510 --> 04:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
optimistic that our Maritime industry
 
04:57:00.410 --> 04:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
can and should be able to compete with
 
04:57:03.170 --> 04:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
14 vessels
 
04:57:05.288 --> 04:57:05.298 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
I agree with a line of questioning that
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
the representatives peer was doing about
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
non-bought States yeah yes there could
 
04:57:18.170 --> 04:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
be other ways to lower energy in New
 
04:57:21.470 --> 04:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example building pipelines
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
or energy corridors from Canada but if
 
04:57:28.128 --> 04:57:28.138 align:start position:0%
you was here long enough you know that
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's politically almost impossible to
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
build a pipelines through New Hampshire
 
04:57:37.550 --> 04:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
or analogical door so here so uh
 
04:57:43.390 --> 04:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
shipping to Boston area of energy is
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
crucial for us and for
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
all the citizens we need to
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
get to the data to estimate this
 
04:57:58.368 --> 04:57:58.378 align:start position:0%
economic impact so our governor and our
 
04:58:00.650 --> 04:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
U.S debt representative Chris papas
 
04:58:04.128 --> 04:58:04.138 align:start position:0%
would have solid data to fight for our
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
constituents and to lower energy prices
 
04:58:10.610 --> 04:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
here please support this Bill thank you
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
04:58:15.288 --> 04:58:15.298 align:start position:0%
see no questions
 
04:58:18.110 --> 04:58:18.120 align:start position:0%

United States law regarding the cargo

I'm sorry thank you
 
04:59:11.208 --> 04:59:11.218 align:start position:0%

04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
40 000 vessels not the couple hundred
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
that I heard earlier they play a vital
 
04:59:32.448 --> 04:59:32.458 align:start position:0%
role in the nation supply chain whereas
 
04:59:35.208 --> 04:59:35.218 align:start position:0%
SB 102 portrays the Jones act as small

Hampshire in 2022 the port of Portsmouth
 
05:00:06.050 --> 05:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
saw 96 vessel deliveries of home heating
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
oil and other important fuel products
 
05:00:09.890 --> 05:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
amounting to about two vessels per week

totaling millions of barrels of fuel for
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents however owing
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
largely to New Hampshire's proximity to
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
Canada around two-thirds of New
 
05:00:20.030 --> 05:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's fuel deliveries are sourced
 
05:00:21.770 --> 05:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
in St John's New Brunswick and carried

New England shipyards to support the

concerns over the cost of home heating
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%

05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
indeed the bill references waivers to

costs
 
05:00:49.610 --> 05:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
while it does that the cost of shipping
 
05:00:51.288 --> 05:00:51.298 align:start position:0%
has virtually no impact on the cost of
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
fuel the consumers fuel prices on the

transportation savings pocketed by those
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
energy Traders we've seen this wherever
 
05:01:02.690 --> 05:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
Jones act waivers are issued
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
in short when the Jones Act is waived as
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
oil Traders not consumers and certainly
 
05:01:09.410 --> 05:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
not American Mariners who benefit
 
05:01:11.448 --> 05:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
Jones act has broad support across the
 
05:01:13.010 --> 05:01:13.020 align:start position:0%

in 2020 a bipartisan group of national

lawmakers described the Jones act as an
 
05:01:46.550 --> 05:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
important asset to our military noting
 
05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
that U.S crude vessels around the world
 
05:01:50.208 --> 05:01:50.218 align:start position:0%

05:01:59.810 --> 05:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
would hurt our ability to project power
 
05:02:01.490 --> 05:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
during a time of War National Emergency
 
05:02:02.930 --> 05:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
and this is no less true for New
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Port of Portsmouth is one of
 
05:02:06.650 --> 05:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
the Navy's most important operational
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
areas in the country in the Jones act
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
ensures the Navy can Charter American
 
05:02:11.690 --> 05:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
vessels with American Mariners both
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
regulated by the U.S Coast Guard to
 
05:02:15.890 --> 05:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
assist with its operations the
 
05:02:17.208 --> 05:02:17.218 align:start position:0%
importance of the Jones act and National
 
05:02:18.650 --> 05:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
Security is further highlighted by
 
05:02:20.090 --> 05:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
recent stories regarding the possible
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
use of Chinese manufactured Harbor
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
cranes by the Chinese Communist party to
 
05:02:25.910 --> 05:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
gather information about American ports
 
05:02:27.708 --> 05:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
some of our most critical pieces of
 
05:02:29.810 --> 05:02:29.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure weakening the Jones act
 
05:02:31.368 --> 05:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
would go beyond that along foreign
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
Nationals to move products including
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
Dangerous Ones such as petroleum
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
products and fertilizer throughout our
 
05:02:37.550 --> 05:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
nation's extensive Coastal and inland
 
05:02:39.770 --> 05:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
waterways this is just one reason the
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
Jones act has such strong support from
 
05:02:43.010 --> 05:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
our military
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
aw member and partner companies are
 
05:02:46.250 --> 05:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
proud to serve the people of New
 
05:02:47.570 --> 05:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a front line industry to
 
05:02:49.368 --> 05:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
its energy supply chain and reaching
 
05:02:50.810 --> 05:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
studies on the economic impact of the
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
Jones act has affirmed its importance to
 
05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
for instance in 2013 the government
 
05:02:57.288 --> 05:02:57.298 align:start position:0%
accountability office found that the
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
Jones act helped ensure reliable regular
 
05:03:01.010 --> 05:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
service to the United States and Puerto
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
Rico and concluded this service was
 
05:03:05.570 --> 05:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
important to the economy there in 2020 a
 
05:03:07.550 --> 05:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
Boston hawaii-based economists released
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
a study find the Jones acted no
 
05:03:10.250 --> 05:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the cost of living
 
05:03:13.368 --> 05:03:13.378 align:start position:0%
in Hawaii most recently in 2022 and I
 
05:03:15.650 --> 05:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
think you have a handout showing this as
 
05:03:17.570 --> 05:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
gas prices were peaking a study found
 
05:03:19.128 --> 05:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
that the Jones act contributed less than
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
one cent to the overall cost of gasoline
 
05:03:23.570 --> 05:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
per gallon
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
the Jones act has stood up to all
 
05:03:26.810 --> 05:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
rational assessment and we believe that
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
a study that assesses its impact
 
05:03:29.930 --> 05:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
specifically in New Hampshire would
 
05:03:31.610 --> 05:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
arrive at the same general conclusions
 
05:03:33.170 --> 05:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
we've seen in these previous studies
 
05:03:35.330 --> 05:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
it'll cost the state tens of thousands
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
of dollars an Untold amount of time and
 
05:03:38.810 --> 05:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
ignore real drivers for increased
 
05:03:40.970 --> 05:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
heating fuel costs and it also gives
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
some extreme interest groups the
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to exploit the mere
 
05:03:45.050 --> 05:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
existence of such a study to create the
 
05:03:46.490 --> 05:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
perception of mounting opposition to the
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
Jones act for these reasons we urge the
 
05:03:50.570 --> 05:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
committee to vote against this bill our
 
05:03:52.128 --> 05:03:52.138 align:start position:0%
members remain committed to working with
 
05:03:53.628 --> 05:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
the government of New Hampshire the
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire to work on your
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
energy issues and I want to I want to
 
05:03:59.150 --> 05:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
offer that on behalf of our members
 
05:04:01.850 --> 05:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
today but it takes it takes everybody it
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
takes the carriers it takes the oil
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
companies it takes takes you all uh I
 
05:04:06.650 --> 05:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your time and
 
05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm happy to answer any
 
05:04:07.980 --> 05:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
consideration I'm happy to answer any
questions

05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.760 --> 05:04:18.368 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:04:18.368 --> 05:04:18.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.490 --> 05:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:27.288 --> 05:04:27.298 align:start position:0%
I can't ask a real question because I
 
05:04:28.970 --> 05:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
never got an answer to my first question
 
05:04:33.410 --> 05:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
as to why Anon Jones Act
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
oil uh heating oil uh facility doesn't
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
charge anymore than a jones-act ship of
 
05:04:44.330 --> 05:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
heating oil to New Hampshire
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
I didn't get an answer for why there's
 
05:04:49.730 --> 05:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
no difference between those two so I
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
gave up
 
05:04:55.250 --> 05:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
you want to try to answer that question
 
05:04:56.930 --> 05:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
I mean one thing I'll add is that
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
foreign carriers uh obviously they're
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
not regulated by the Coast Guard
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
um they pay their Sailors uh just enough
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
to avoid being accused of slavery
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh and obviously the construction
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
standards aren't there
 
05:05:10.208 --> 05:05:10.218 align:start position:0%
um you know the Chinese government
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
subsidizes shipbuilding to the tune of
 
05:05:14.990 --> 05:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know hundreds of billions of dollars
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
um so without subsidizing our
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
shipbuilding industry of course we're
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
not going to build ships any cheaper I
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we have several member
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
companies and there's several companies
 
05:05:24.890 --> 05:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
that aren't members of organization that
 
05:05:26.330 --> 05:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
would love to get involved in the liquid
 
05:05:29.270 --> 05:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
natural gas business however uh they're
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
not going to do that without a contract
 
05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
that ensures that they'll be able to
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
pay off for that investment ships are
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
expensive granted the the technology to
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
liquefy natural gas and to handle things
 
05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
under pressure is expensive no matter
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
where you build it the real problem in
 
05:05:47.810 --> 05:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
New England is that these products are
 
05:05:49.010 --> 05:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
generally purchased on the spot Market
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
when you're completely subject to Global
 
05:05:53.330 --> 05:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
supply and demand as it has already been
 
05:05:53.340 --> 05:05:54.890 align:start position:0%
supply and demand as it has already been
referenced

05:05:54.890 --> 05:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
05:05:54.900 --> 05:05:55.490 align:start position:0%
referenced
um

05:05:55.490 --> 05:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:57.650 --> 05:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
purchasing on a contract would stabilize
 
05:05:59.690 --> 05:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
prices it would give the shipping
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
companies the security they need to
 
05:06:03.890 --> 05:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
engage in these things as I mentioned we
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
have member companies
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
such as Crowley which already serves
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
this area we have a non-member company
 
05:06:13.128 --> 05:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
named Brian our transportation that
 
05:06:15.530 --> 05:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
serves this area considerably shell and
 
05:06:17.390 --> 05:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
Harvey Golf are also interested in this
 
05:06:18.770 --> 05:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:06:18.780 --> 05:06:19.670 align:start position:0%
as well
um

05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:21.230 --> 05:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
I know that didn't fully answer your
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
question but it's something our industry
 
05:06:25.850 --> 05:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
is very interested in and would love to
 
05:06:28.368 --> 05:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
have a further conversation with uh
 
05:06:30.050 --> 05:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
policymakers about it
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the question we inquire
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
I do have a question I figured one out I
 
05:06:35.810 --> 05:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
found another note
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
I saw that at the end of last year uh
 
05:06:41.330 --> 05:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
Matson shipping
 
05:06:41.340 --> 05:06:42.770 align:start position:0%
Matson shipping
uh

05:06:42.770 --> 05:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
I guess signed a contract with
 
05:06:46.730 --> 05:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia Shipyard the three of the
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
largest container tank ships
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
ever built in the United States worth
 
05:06:53.448 --> 05:06:53.458 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars and they should
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
have them finished in about two years or
 
05:06:56.810 --> 05:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
three years
 
05:07:00.050 --> 05:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
but my question is this
 
05:07:02.448 --> 05:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
they don't want to ship oil they don't
 
05:07:04.970 --> 05:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
want to ship uh natural gas to New
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
England they want to ship it going east
 
05:07:09.288 --> 05:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
going west rather they want to ship to
 
05:07:09.298 --> 05:07:10.550 align:start position:0%
going west rather they want to ship to
China

05:07:10.550 --> 05:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
China
 
05:07:10.560 --> 05:07:13.070 align:start position:0%
China
and

05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
out in that direction I guess they want
 
05:07:17.390 --> 05:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
to ship it overseas in other words so my
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
it seems like everywhere I've looked
 
05:07:25.550 --> 05:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
selling Natural Gas
 
05:07:27.530 --> 05:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
to New England doesn't seem to be a
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
priority to almost any shipping outfit
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
that they can get more money per
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
BTU if you will from almost anybody else
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
is that an observation that's valid
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's the Dynamics of a
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
global market if somebody is willing to
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
pay more that's where the material is
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
going to go uh one thing I can tell you
 
05:07:50.330 --> 05:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
is some of our member companies that
 
05:07:52.550 --> 05:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
serve New Hampshire have noted that a
 
05:07:53.570 --> 05:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
lot of the vessels they bring here
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
aren't fully loaded which suggests that
 
05:07:57.650 --> 05:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
the needs being met
 
05:07:57.660 --> 05:07:58.910 align:start position:0%
the needs being met
um

05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:01.250 --> 05:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the the Matson
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
ships you're referencing you know we
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
deal exclusively with tugboats towboats
 
05:08:07.250 --> 05:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
barges we do have a relationship with
 
05:08:08.690 --> 05:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
some of the folks at Matson so I'm happy
 
05:08:10.368 --> 05:08:10.378 align:start position:0%
to follow up with that on you it might
 
05:08:11.570 --> 05:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
also be that they're serving Hawaii
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
because Matson does a tremendous amount
 
05:08:18.288 --> 05:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:18.298 --> 05:08:19.850 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:08:19.850 --> 05:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:19.860 --> 05:08:21.530 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

05:08:21.530 --> 05:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:22.850 --> 05:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking our
 
05:08:24.890 --> 05:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
question New Hampshire is a really nice
 
05:08:26.330 --> 05:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
State it'd be a shame if something
 
05:08:29.090 --> 05:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
happened to it so I appreciate if uh you
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
know you're testifying before us today
 
05:08:31.860 --> 05:08:33.050 align:start position:0%
know you're testifying before us today
um

05:08:33.050 --> 05:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:35.930 --> 05:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
in the Department's letter it talks
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
about uh l d tankers and it says there
 
05:08:40.730 --> 05:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
are currently 12
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
LNG tankers
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
that were constructed that would meet
 
05:08:46.550 --> 05:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
the Jones act but they're being
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
re-flagged in other countries
 
05:08:53.050 --> 05:08:53.060 align:start position:0%
is it true that there aren't any LNG
 
05:08:56.448 --> 05:08:56.458 align:start position:0%
compliant tankers and what would it take
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
to get one or two of these vessels
 
05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
reflagged in the U.S so it would be
 
05:09:01.970 --> 05:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
compliant sure
 
05:09:04.010 --> 05:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak specifically to tankers
 
05:09:06.170 --> 05:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
because that's not who we represent we
 
05:09:08.690 --> 05:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
represent tugboats and barges I do know
 
05:09:10.190 --> 05:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
that we have members very interested in
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
converting barges into carrying LNG but
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
again the cost of that needs means they
 
05:09:15.890 --> 05:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
need a long-term contract to help
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
justify their investment uh re-flagging
 
05:09:20.090 --> 05:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
a vessel is possible although it is
 
05:09:21.650 --> 05:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
difficult I believe it requires an act
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
of Congress but it has happened before
 
05:09:27.530 --> 05:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
you know and that would be more it's a
 
05:09:30.770 --> 05:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
lot more likely that's a ship that was
 
05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
built in America was a Jones act vessel
 
05:09:35.090 --> 05:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
left the service and came back it's
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot harder politically to
 
05:09:38.570 --> 05:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
Reef to to flag a vessel United States
 
05:09:40.970 --> 05:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
that wasn't built in the United States
 
05:09:40.980 --> 05:09:43.550 align:start position:0%
that wasn't built in the United States
um

05:09:43.550 --> 05:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
05:09:46.920 --> 05:09:48.590 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
um

05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:51.410 --> 05:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
you said that it would be possible uh to
 
05:09:51.420 --> 05:09:52.730 align:start position:0%
you said that it would be possible uh to
convert

05:09:52.730 --> 05:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
convert
 
05:09:55.250 --> 05:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
um some of the barges uh that are
 
05:09:58.128 --> 05:09:58.138 align:start position:0%
currently operating uh in and out of U.S
 
05:10:01.368 --> 05:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
ports to ship liquefied natural gas did
 
05:10:03.530 --> 05:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
I understand you correctly that the
 
05:10:05.690 --> 05:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
issues are not really technological but
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
rather matters of costs yes ma'am
 
05:10:13.490 --> 05:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you so
 
05:10:18.410 --> 05:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
are you the barges that I see in
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh that push all the coal up
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
