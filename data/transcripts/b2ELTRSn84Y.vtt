00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.490 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:05:46.919><c> it</c><00:05:47.160><c> would</c><00:05:47.340><c> seem</c>

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 align:start position:0%
so it would seem
 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.310 align:start position:0%
so it would seem
a<00:05:49.500><c> simple</c><00:05:49.680><c> solution</c><00:05:50.160><c> might</c><00:05:50.580><c> be</c><00:05:50.759><c> for</c><00:05:51.320><c> the</c>

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
a simple solution might be for the

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 align:start position:0%
Simply decide who is going to attend one
 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.129 align:start position:0%
Simply decide who is going to attend one
and<00:05:58.620><c> and</c><00:05:58.860><c> who</c><00:05:59.100><c> is</c><00:05:59.220><c> going</c><00:05:59.400><c> to</c><00:05:59.580><c> attend</c><00:05:59.940><c> the</c><00:06:00.120><c> other</c>

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
and and who is going to attend the other
 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.950 align:start position:0%
and and who is going to attend the other
um it's<00:06:01.979><c> not</c><00:06:02.220><c> a</c><00:06:02.460><c> requirement</c><00:06:02.820><c> that</c><00:06:03.240><c> the</c><00:06:03.780><c> full</c>

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
um it's not a requirement that the full
 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.870 align:start position:0%
um it's not a requirement that the full
Senate<00:06:04.440><c> attend</c>

um
 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.969 align:start position:0%
um
so<00:06:07.139><c> it</c><00:06:07.380><c> would</c><00:06:07.560><c> seem</c><00:06:07.979><c> to</c><00:06:08.400><c> in</c><00:06:08.759><c> order</c><00:06:08.940><c> to</c>

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to in order to
 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.610 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to in order to
go<00:06:10.979><c> through</c><00:06:11.160><c> all</c><00:06:11.400><c> of</c><00:06:11.580><c> the</c><00:06:11.759><c> time</c><00:06:11.940><c> and</c><00:06:12.180><c> expense</c>

this
um I<00:18:42.000><c> think</c><00:18:42.120><c> it's</c><00:18:42.480><c> wrong</c><00:18:42.900><c> to</c><00:18:43.260><c> retain</c><00:18:43.620><c> it</c><00:18:43.860><c> at</c>

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.130 align:start position:0%
um I think it's wrong to retain it at
this<00:18:44.400><c> moment</c>

um
I<00:18:47.640><c> think</c><00:18:47.700><c> that</c><00:18:47.940><c> representation</c><00:18:48.480><c> matters</c><00:18:49.020><c> and</c>

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think that representation matters and
 

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.350 align:start position:0%
I think that representation matters and
I've<00:18:49.679><c> seen</c><00:18:49.919><c> the</c><00:18:50.220><c> difference</c><00:18:50.400><c> it</c><00:18:50.700><c> makes</c><00:18:50.880><c> in</c>

represents that
 

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.570 align:start position:0%
represents that
um<00:19:10.380><c> so</c><00:19:10.500><c> while</c><00:19:10.620><c> I</c><00:19:10.799><c> do</c><00:19:10.919><c> think</c><00:19:11.100><c> it's</c><00:19:11.220><c> important</c>
