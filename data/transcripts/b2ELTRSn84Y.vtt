00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
that being the case I wondered if rep
 
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
Kosovo would like to speak to his motion
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh briefly thank you Mr chair
 
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.550 align:start position:0%
uh briefly thank you Mr chair
um

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
cacr-10 was
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
um as it's
 
00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 align:start position:0%
changing the Constitution in order to
 
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 align:start position:0%
convenience some senators
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
and this committee really felt like the
 
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
bar was not reached to change the
 
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
constitution for the for that purpose
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
um we also felt like the
 
00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
um unintended consequences weren't
 
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
really thought through on what it meant
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
for the house and for the governor and
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
and and and that so
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
um we felt it was the right thing to do
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
is to uh to kill it
 
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you repressible
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 align:start position:0%
I will just add the two dates in
 
00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 align:start position:0%
question uh that are in the calendar at
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
present it really is a two days every
 
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
on the odd numbered years
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
for orientation and for inauguration
 
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.029 align:start position:0%
for orientation and for inauguration
um

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
the Constitution doesn't require
 
00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.430 align:start position:0%
the Constitution doesn't require
attendance

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 align:start position:0%
so it would seem
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
a simple solution might be for the
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
Senate to
 
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 align:start position:0%
Simply decide who is going to attend one
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
and and who is going to attend the other
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
um it's not a requirement that the full
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
Senate attend
 
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.529 align:start position:0%
Senate attend
um

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to in order to
 
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
go through all of the time and expense
 
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
of changing the Constitution
 
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
which representative wall is quick to
 
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
point out correctly we should never
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
change the Constitution
 
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
um except for things that are serious
 
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 align:start position:0%
and and of a extreme nature
 
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 align:start position:0%
and and need to be done
 
00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 align:start position:0%
um this is this would represent a a an
 
00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
um this is this would represent a a an
amendment

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and a cost to the taxpayers of New
 
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.029 align:start position:0%
um and a cost to the taxpayers of New
Hampshire

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
in order to just simply
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
help with
 
00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.129 align:start position:0%
help with
with

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
the expense perhaps of of senators and
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
the inconvenience of the Senators to to
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
attend two days
 
00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.770 align:start position:0%
attend two days
um

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
so I uh for that reason I I concur with
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
the um the Ito motion and if there is no
 
00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:07.370 align:start position:0%
the um the Ito motion and if there is no
further

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 align:start position:0%

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
um Can anyone answer the question
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative wall who serves on both
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative historical
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
committee and was Prior chair of
 
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.810 align:start position:0%
committee and was Prior chair of
legislators

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
um and the question was whether other
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
bills have come through like this before
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
yes last year we had a bill come through
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
for uh directing The Joint historic
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee to consider accepting the
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
Wentworth cheswell bill and the only
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
reason we couldn't act on that is at
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
that time we had no likeness for that
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
portrait so we couldn't do it but in my
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
time in many years I don't remember
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
another bill coming by for a portrait
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
specifically there could have been but I
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
don't recall
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
um I will only add that yes it is true
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
that we had the um the request for a
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
likeness to be painted by um of
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
Wentworth cheswell last year the house
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
did act this committee did act
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
um positively the Senate chose to
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
change or amend the bill to a plaque
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
rather than a portrait for the reasons
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
that Senator that rep wall stated that
 
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
it was likeness was a problem
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
I don't recall to to go further I don't
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
recall at that time
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
us taking a look at the actual statutes
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
on the joint legislative historical
 
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:48.889 align:start position:0%
on the joint legislative historical
committee

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.150 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
if we had
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
if I had I think I would have been in
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
the same position that I'm in now so
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
so the the point of requesting a retain
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
now I think would have been the same it
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
had enough it has nothing to do with the
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
original title of the of the bill here
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
it has more to do with the overall
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
policy of is it is it correct that these
 
00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:21.139 align:start position:0%
requests come to the legislative
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
Administration committee or is it
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
something if the plain reading of the
 
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:29.540 align:start position:0%
statute on the historical committee
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
appears like that request should go to
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
them directly
 
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
them directly
um

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the reason for the
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
retain I think in order to determine
 
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.329 align:start position:0%
retain I think in order to determine
um

00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:43.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
what in the future what what that
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
process should be
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
you'll notice and I handed out a copy of
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
that statute you'll notice that under
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
17 Dash I colon 2 committee
 
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.069 align:start position:0%
17 Dash I colon 2 committee
responsibilities

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:14:01.079 --> 00:14:01.970 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
um

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
under Roman V
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
it says to administer and enforce the
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
collections policy established by the
 
00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
collections policy established by the
committee

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what that is and I've asked
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
the chair and and no one seems to be
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
able to to um
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
provide that it also says that that
 
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
under still continuing under Roman 5
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation as needed to
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
um and then under Romans 7 it says to
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
provide guidelines to all branches of
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
state government relative to the
 
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
acquisition of historical cultural and
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
artistic objects
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that is
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what that guidance is
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
and and lastly under Roman nine it says
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for the placement of
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
portraits so that kind of takes away the
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
piece that was in the existing
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
legislation that says that this would be
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
put in the state house
 
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.569 align:start position:0%
put in the state house
um

00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
I think that's where this needs to go
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
so so while I understand the their
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
request for
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
a portrait of um of the late Rogers
 
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.750 align:start position:0%
a portrait of um of the late Rogers
Johnson

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have further
 
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.769 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have further
information

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:23.779 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
before we proceed and I would think that
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's the perfect time for a uh for a
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
retained Motion in order to discuss this
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
over the summer with the joint
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
legislative historical committee which
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
as I pointed out rep
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
resentative wall serves on so um
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
I think it would be great representative
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I agree with a
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
lot of what you have said
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
um in chapter law we already have
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
Title 1 chapter 4 section 9 defines
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
where we may Place portraits and other
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
memorabilia right but it doesn't
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
put that initial step into place
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and at one time we had the
 
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Heritage collections
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
committee which oversaw all the
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
artifacts for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
the historic ones and um that committee
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
was Blended finally with the joint
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
history oh yeah with the joint historic
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
the wording from
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
the Heritage collection committee wasn't
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily Blended in adequately or at
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
all with the joint historic committee so
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
we need clarification on just exactly
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
what we will do and how thank you thank
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
you and I also wanted to point out that
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
the committee has received
 
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
some some research from our researcher
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
and in fact there's one page of it here
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
in front of you from an excerpt from the
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
Colorado's criteria and procedures for
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
the gift of loan of objects of Art and
 
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
memorials placed in the permanent or
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
temporary basis in the Colorado State
 
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.610 align:start position:0%
temporary basis in the Colorado State
Capitol

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
Capitol
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
I think this is what funnily enough we
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
were we were able to get the Colorado
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
version of what I think they're
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
referring to in our New Hampshire
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
statute under Roman five here I think
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
this is what we should be having
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it would be
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial if we don't have it for us to
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
be able to access uh what some of the
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
other states have done this is obviously
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
a a situation or a problem
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
that has arisen in a number of our state
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
houses across the country
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with space
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
at some point we need to get this policy
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
correct and and I think
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
the the very fine research that we were
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
able to put together so far would be
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
helpful for the for the people serving
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the joint legislative historical
 
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:14.660 align:start position:0%
Committee in order to
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
administer and enforce the collections
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
policy established by the committee if
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
they haven't already
 
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:25.700 align:start position:0%
so um representative netting Wong
 
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:32.690 align:start position:0%
so um representative netting Wong
[Music]

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
us portraits but I think for the bill
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's in front of us right now because
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
we can always file more legislation
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
later it's really important that we pass
 
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.810 align:start position:0%
later it's really important that we pass
this

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it's wrong to retain it at
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
this moment
 
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.090 align:start position:0%
this moment
um

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think that representation matters and
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
I've seen the difference it makes in
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
kids and adults when they see people
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
that look like them on the walls of
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
places or even just media
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's really important for
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
the kids that come in here and for the
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
rest of us to see the diversity that's
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
been in the house because I don't think
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
the state house as it is right now um
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
represents that
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
um so while I do think it's important
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
that maybe we I mean that we do figure
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
out some regulations I think the bill
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
right now as is should go forth
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative well thank you I
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
do know one thing for sure and that is
 
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
that a portrait is not accepted or put
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
onto the walls unless the individual has
 
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
had significant
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and Irene really significant
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
contributions that they have made to the
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
state and to our government and we did
 
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.310 align:start position:0%
 
contributions

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
of this individual was an assistant
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
minority leader at one point but he also
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
did an awful lot for his community and
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
his County
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
as well as for his race and there has
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
been discussion outside the legislature
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually that
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps as people step back he had an
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunate death just this past year as
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
people step back and get a little more
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
perspective as a little bit of time goes
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
by because initially we all know you
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't make big decisions right away
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
when we lose someone as much as we want
 
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
to that it may perhaps be appropriate to
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
have such a distinguished portrait
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
placed in a local he was from Stratham
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
and perhaps to have his portrait which
 
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:46.580 align:start position:0%
hasn't been painted yet
 
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
mounted in stratum in a location where a
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
lot of people would see it recognize it
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
remember him for what he did and honor
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
him more locally I'm not saying he
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't deserve to be here but I'm just
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
saying that if you look at the plaques
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
underneath the portraits we have now
 
00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:11.660 align:start position:0%
um these individuals had longer term
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
bigger contributions to the state if I
 
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
may put it that way so I think we need
 
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
to I think we need to step back a little
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
bit before we move forward with this
 
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I would also point
 
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.990 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I would also point
out

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
on the chance
 
00:21:32.529 --> 00:21:32.539 align:start position:0%
that this collections policy does exist
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
and and will turn up later
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I would hate to move ahead
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the portrait
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
and find out that it violated any of the
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
collections policy that um
 
00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419 align:start position:0%
that already exists we don't we don't
 
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
really know that
 
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
really know that
um

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:55.460 align:start position:0%
and I also
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
understand yeah
 
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059 align:start position:0%
I I know I knew and liked Rogers Johnson
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that we are dishonoring
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um we're not saying no we're saying
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
um let's let's utilize this legislation
 
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're on the right
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
side of any collections policy that's
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
already in statute that's that's my only
 
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.789 align:start position:0%
already in statute that's that's my only
Point

00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
Point
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
um well not my only point but that's my
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
main point on on the uh on the statement
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I agree with what you've just said
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily disqualify him
 
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.789 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily disqualify him
no

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
um but we do need to step back and look
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
at the big picture and we do need to
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
also recognize every time someone wants
 
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.430 align:start position:0%
also recognize every time someone wants
to

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
donate a portrait
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the spaces that we have
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
in the State House complex for where we
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
can put these portraits we do have
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
limited space and
 
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
quite honestly it's getting crowded
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
we've had some concerns about where to
 
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
place more portraits we've moved things
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
around uh in the past couple years got
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
more order into which ones belong where
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and we need to determine some may be
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
better qualified to serve to be mounted
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
rather in the lob for example right and
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
then and it still didn't allow us to do
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
that right this bill was only specific
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
to the state house I believe it wasn't
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
her right
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
so so even that
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
um if we just take the point of the
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
existing legislation saying that the
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
portrait would be hung in the State
 
00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:43.490 align:start position:0%
portrait would be hung in the State
House

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
House
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
that would appear to have overstepped
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
our bounds under Roman nine that says
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
it's the duty of the joint legislative
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
historical committee to determine to be
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
responsible for the placement of
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
portraits Flags bus statutes or other
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
Memorial objects within or on
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
legislative facilities as defined by RSA
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
14 colon 14-b in consultation with the
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
division of historical Resources
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
resources so just on that one simple
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
thing it sounds like
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
um the legislation as it stands in front
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
of us would need to be amended anyway
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I I think
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
I think we've beat this up pretty good
 
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.890 align:start position:0%
I think we've beat this up pretty good
um

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion or I
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
where where
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're voting on Senate Bill 28 just to
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
re remind everyone Senate Bill 28 to
 
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
re remind everyone Senate Bill 28 to
retain

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.029 align:start position:0%
retain
um

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%

vice chair representative Sheehan
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative McCarter
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%

speak to her motion to retain yes thank
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
um the speaker has established a special
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions and we've been
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
meeting and
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
um the legislation that we create in
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
this special committee will be amended
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
into SB 84 so that's why we're retaining
 
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
it so it can be used with the findings
 
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
and the work that we come up with in
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative she and Is
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
I will just say
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm not entirely certain
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure it's been determined
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
the process for how this special
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee on committees is going to
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
operate or if their their process will
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
will involve legislative Administration
 
00:27:54.179 --> 00:27:55.610 align:start position:0%
will involve legislative Administration
even

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.450 align:start position:0%
even
um

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
this this seems to be the bill that
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
would be used and it seems to be the
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
most logical bill for us to um to hang
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
on to for that purpose if it's necessary
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
if it's not we'll simply
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
deal with it in November in our in our
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
meeting and then it will go to the Full
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.909 align:start position:0%
we do have uh I think we're at three or
four

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%

00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
the speaker has announced that we would
 
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
be able to Begin work on retained bills
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
in June
 
00:30:23.159 --> 00:30:24.409 align:start position:0%
in June
um

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we have to begin in
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
June we have until November uh to file a
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
report on these so uh it is my intention
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
in the over the next week or so and I'll
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
probably uh talk to a few people during
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
session on Thursday
 
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.010 align:start position:0%
session on Thursday
um

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
I'm leaning towards making these uh
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
a few subcommittees rather than
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
Committee of the whole
 
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299 align:start position:0%
um there may be a need for the
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee especially on the bill for
 
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.169 align:start position:0%
subcommittee especially on the bill for
ethics

00:31:02.169 --> 00:31:02.179 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
to have some conversation with um
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee it's been difficult
 
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
in the past to schedule things with the
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee and especially when we
 
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:18.380 align:start position:0%
have a full Committee of the whole
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
schedule so perhaps if we can get a
 
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittee together to um to have a
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Ethics Committee
 
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
um come up with some ideas and then that
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
subcommittee bring them to the committee
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
um that that's seems to be my procedure
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to entertain any other
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that but um
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
these other two that we have retained
 
00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:48.289 align:start position:0%
these other two that we have retained
today

00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:48.299 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:48.950 align:start position:0%
today
um

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 84 I don't think we need to
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
form a subcommittee we we pretty much
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee installed in the in
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
the other special committee on uh on
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
study committees
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
and as far as the the bill we just
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
discussed regarding the joint historical
 
00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:12.289 align:start position:0%
discussed regarding the joint historical
committee

00:32:12.289 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
that I think we we will form a
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
um and let them come up with how or if
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
we need to proceed
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative wall thank you Mr
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%

has not scheduled its next meeting but I
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%

up and and get that right out on the
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
table and not table it get it on the
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
table for discussion and see where we
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
can get with that to help this out thank

um

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
I would think
 
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.769 align:start position:0%
I would think
um

00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
it it is a topic that that needs to come
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
up and needs to be discussed and um and
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
if you would let us know when that
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
exists I will certainly
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
be in attendance and I would think
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
um we need to have a discussion about uh
 
00:33:35.529 --> 00:33:35.539 align:start position:0%
who what which members of the of
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration would serve
 
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
on a subcommittee if if such a thing
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
would need to be placed
 
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.330 align:start position:0%
would need to be placed
um

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for now uh the plan we
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't have anything
 
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.750 align:start position:0%
don't have anything
um

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the Senate so we don't
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
have to deal with anything that maybe a
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
an amended version in the Senate so all
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
of the Committees of conference is a
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
non-issue for this committee you can
 
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:09.500 align:start position:0%
applaud now if you'd like
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
it is um
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that uh if for those
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
of you that serve on other committees
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
that you won't be called for a committee
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
of conference there
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
um we've done
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
our job
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
um as cleanly and as efficiently as we
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
possibly could
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
um I think we're in pretty good shape
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
um moving into the summer but um
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
I would only ask that if you receive or
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
look for a note from our
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
our vice chair if there is questions on
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
setting up subcommittees and who would
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to serve if there
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
are subcommittees specifically you would
 
00:34:59.570 --> 00:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
like to be on please let us know
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
um that would be a great help as you can
 
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
see attendance is is spotty and we
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
already have a shorter staffed committee
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
as it is so the more volunteerism the
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
better as far as I'm concerned
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
with that I am done is there any
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
questions comments uh concerns that we
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
need to handle before we close business
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
for today
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative wall I I have a
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
