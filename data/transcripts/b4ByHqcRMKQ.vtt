00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
all right um 36
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh 10 past 10
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning I'm going to convene
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
the division three work session
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
made a lot of decisions we've which has
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
allowed the LBA to really begin locking
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
down uh all of our amendments
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
um uh and so today is really our last
 
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
day to to make decisions to make sure
 
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:44.339 align:start position:0%
that the whole LBA paper chase is
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
completed by Friday
 
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.829 align:start position:0%
completed by Friday
so

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so what I think we may end up having
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
to do is is get through these kind of
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
rapidly make as many decisions as we can
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
and then uh we'll probably need to
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
recess while Mr Ripple and the OLS works
 
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.290 align:start position:0%
recess while Mr Ripple and the OLS works
together

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll probably end up having
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
to come back sometime this afternoon and
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
and I'll get an estimated time for Mr
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
Ripple when that might be based on the
 
00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
workload that we uh we end up giving
 
00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:22.670 align:start position:0%
workload that we uh we end up giving
them

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
so so that's kind of how I I think the
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
day is going to go you're probably going
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
to have a really long lunch but you're
 
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
going to need to come back before
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
and and we so let's let's let's let's
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
make sure we do some time checks
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney has a bill to
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
introduce the Senate at two o'clock are
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
there are there any other schedule
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
conflicts during the day that I should
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
know about
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to work around what we
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
can I don't think your two o'clock is
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a problem because I suspect
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's part of the time that OLS is
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
going to need to finish their
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
documentation so you're you're okay I
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
have a three o'clock but
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
um for about a half an hour but I would
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
be here if it's open okay I
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
okay I also have a two o'clock I believe
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
you you have a two o'clock as well yes
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
okay any others
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
um does everyone have
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
um the uh as of March 21 tentative
 
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
actions related to hb2 this guy
 
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.389 align:start position:0%
actions related to hb2 this guy
okay

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
and where is representative erf he's
 
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.650 align:start position:0%
and where is representative erf he's
here

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:56.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
you only have two I thought you had
 
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.030 align:start position:0%
you only have two I thought you had
three

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.210 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
the most complicated thing we have to
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
work on I think or by we I mean the team
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
with Mr Ripple and OLS is the Medicaid
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
targeted rates and so uh representative
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
verf do you want to introduce us to what
 
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.769 align:start position:0%
verf do you want to introduce us to what
you've

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
you've
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
I would love to I was having Jana man
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody else there I didn't
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
have enough to give to uh representative
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh the chairman and and our other
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
colleagues so she'll be done just
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
momentarily she's literally rubbing them
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
out right now okay so let's let's let's
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
do what we can and that is
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
um on 212 the Choose Love program I it's
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
great out here but I I thought this we
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
ended up tying 4-4 on that would you
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
remind me of what we did representative
 
00:14:57.959 --> 00:14:59.930 align:start position:0%
remind me of what we did representative
tolerski

00:14:59.930 --> 00:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
tolerski
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
this is this was a program you loved and
 
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:16.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
the the the blue sign
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay all right all right oh I even sang
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
what the world needs now is love sweet
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
love so okay all right so
 
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.069 align:start position:0%
love so okay all right so
um

00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're hand I I will keep that I don't
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
care to revisit it then
 
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um uh regarding
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
um uh the rate
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
um requests as well
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
um you know we have an amendment and
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
some of the values from what what came
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
from Monahan changed from from our work
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
from the additional research so I don't
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
know whether
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
um uh whether we should combine these
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
together or and um we had a couple of
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
minor a couple of changes this morning
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
so I don't have the final version but we
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
do have a printed out version of
 
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
amendment on the Medicaid rate requests
 
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
so so thank you for all the work you've
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
put into that and what I think would
 
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
probably allow us to wrap our heads
 
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
around this the best is the document
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
we've looked at the most as a as a group
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh related to the Medicaid targeted rate
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
increases has been sort of the initial
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
Monahan Community document and I know
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
that representative verf is prepared to
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
talk to his View of that and so let's
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
use that maybe as a as a the initial
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
starter and then and then we'll have you
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
come in and help us crosswalk what
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
you've done relative to what we hear
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
sounds great okay representative are we
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
ready now yes sir
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
so you should all have a black and white
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
version of this
 
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:03.500 align:start position:0%
which is basically the Monahan document
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
I supplemented it with
 
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see at the bottom of page one
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh one of the people who was here
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday she's probably back again
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah there she is thank you
 
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:18.020 align:start position:0%
um she talked about
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
two the TB tbds that were in there so
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
that was the home health age and you'll
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
notice that below where the row below
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
where it says home health aids there's a
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
first row there says MCL payments that's
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
the number she gave me and then if you
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
flip to the top of the next page page or
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
flip it over I guess to the top of the
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
next page you'll see the Medicaid ffs
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
provider payments that's another number
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
she gave me so my understanding is that
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
those are the two tbds that make up the
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
TBD the two values the two sets of
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
values that make up the TBD I'm sorry so
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
that was one change and then sorry go
 
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.770 align:start position:0%
that was one change and then sorry go
ahead

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
um okay so I'm seeing uh decimal points
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is if you go back to
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
page one you'll notice everything's in
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
millions so I wanted to be very precise
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
I took the number she gave me which was
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know for instance in one case it
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
was 774 000 480 dollars and I put a
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
point at the beginning okay I I'm just
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
trying to track uh actions Laura uh you
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
you your number was I think something
 
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.669 align:start position:0%
you your number was I think something
like

00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
984 and then I forward that to you and
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's there's two numbers that need to
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
be summed there's a seven seven four
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
thousand the bottom of page one and then
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
the at the top of page two there's
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
another 191 000. so the total of that
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
would be about what you just said okay I
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
all I'm doing is I'm not disagreeing I'm
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
just simply trying to make sure that the
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
late breaking data that we got has
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
gotten to you and and is Incorporated in
 
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
your analysis I read her email okay and
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
I also spoke with her yesterday
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
afternoon I think I have the numbers
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
right if I don't okay
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
all right so that was one of the one of
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
the additions to the Monahan document
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
the other one is continuing down the top
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
of page two where it says Granite State
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
Independent Living that was what Mr
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
lippman discussed with us yesterday the
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
three million in each year for the
 
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
three million in each year for the
uh

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
pcla services
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
so so far so good
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay so philosophically and this is
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
where I might jive with what you've been
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
doing over there
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
um philosophically here was what I did
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
and it lends itself to
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
um to changes as I'll describe so I took
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
a total of 40 million dollars per year
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
as the as the sum will allocate at this
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
point I still have no idea where we
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
stand on the whole what we've done in
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
terms of availability of of of General
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
funds but just taking that as a number
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
you'll notice down on the right hand
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
side a number of uh in that column a
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
number of them say irf hold constant and
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
those appear next to the
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
um the home health aide Rose along with
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
the granite state Independent Living row
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
and then if you skip quite a ways along
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
I think towards the end
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh on page four the rebasing does not
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
say hold constant but please write in
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
there hold constant that was one that
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
was pointed out to me this morning that
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's at the top of page four so that
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
makes with me on that one
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
oh it is written in I guess I wrote it
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
and then it got copied thank you it's
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's not on page four under rebasing we
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
we should write in the right hand column
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
Earth hold constant right
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
and change the zeros are you no no it's
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
six it says six what do you mean six and
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
then zero No No it should be six and six
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
actually oh oh oh I I didn't change that
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
I just assumed that we basically took
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
place in the first year it takes place
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
in the first year but it still costs us
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money in the second
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
year Oh I thought rebasing was a was a
 
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.610 align:start position:0%
year Oh I thought rebasing was a was a
costume

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
error okay so put six in there you're
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
saying yes okay and oh thank you and
 
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
whole constant just means
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'll explain I'll explain I will explain
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
and then there's a couple more just so
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
I'm clear
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
page seven I guess are all the rest and
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
this is the midwives provider and birth
 
00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:14.690 align:start position:0%
this is the midwives provider and birth
centers

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
the ambulance
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
so those three
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
so it's so so far so good
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay so here's what hold constant means
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
so we're going to do account so those
 
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
are the Rel as I understand that first
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
either they want to be fixed like the
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
rebasing or
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
um the uh one that Mr Lipman brought up
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
which was the uh
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
granted State and independent living it
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
was important that those be fully funded
 
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word at the rates
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
that were at the amounts that were in
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
here because the amounts in columns two
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
and three are actual dollar amounts
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
so the notion here is those ones that I
 
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
put down hold constant they'll be fully
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
funded so the total of all of those will
 
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
get subtracted from the top level number
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
the 40 million dollars per year in this
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
case and that will leave some amount of
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
money per year and that will then be
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
proportionally in proportion to the way
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
the other values are set in here to all
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
things proportionally allocated in this
 
00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
case downward
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
since obviously there's not 100 million
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of 40 million dollars
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
then I also chat with Mr Lipman briefly
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
on the way out the door and this relates
 
00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
to how that's done now you may I call if
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong I'm sure somebody will pipe
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
them tell me I'm I'm wrong it won't be
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
that for the first it'll take the first
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
half to get everything
 
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.250 align:start position:0%
half to get everything
done

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
but that they could sequence them in
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
and when I was on the way the door he
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
said to me well just tell us to do some
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
percentage in the first half and some
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
percentage in the second half of the
 
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
first half of the next of this year so
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
the first quarter and the second quarter
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
of 24.
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
and I figured well half of them half of
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
the value not half of the not half of
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
the rows but half of the value will be
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
set up in the first quarter so July
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
August September and then the other half
 
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
in the last quarter uh the rest of the
 
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
in the last quarter uh the rest of the
months

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
um so so that means there'll be less
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
money you're going to have there'll be
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
no money going out there doing the first
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
quarter because there's just still doing
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
rate setting and there'll be some money
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
going out in the second quarter because
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
some of half of them will have been set
 
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
up and then there'll be the total amount
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
if you will which would be 20 million
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
dollars for the final half of that year
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
40 million the full 40 million in the in
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
the year 25. so so that's the notion
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
behind so that's the way to
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
get the rates even essentially give us
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
more money because we know we're not
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to be spending it so we'll apply
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
it further on down the line
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
does the does the explanation of the
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
philosophy make sense
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
I I could just use a small example and
 
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:53.659 align:start position:0%
if we add the 6 million back
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
what do you think the total amount is of
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
the hold constant no idea but let me
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
give you a very simple small example
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
so let's say we have a hundred and ten
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
dollars to work with
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
and ten dollars wants to be held
 
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.789 align:start position:0%
and ten dollars wants to be held
constant

00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
constant
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
we subtract the ten dollars
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that gives us a hundred dollars
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
now let's assume we have two other
 
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.270 align:start position:0%
now let's assume we have two other
entries

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
entries
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh one is forty
 
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
and one is
 
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
and one is
60.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
60.
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:34.810 align:start position:0%
we're going to
apply

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:34.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
I bet I made this too tough for myself
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
didn't I Kevin well you're you're too
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
sleepy that's why I can't do the math
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
quickly in my head you want to just
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
finish it up well you report you're
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
portioning 90 of the money among 90 of
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
the services
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
so that's an uh a 10 decrease basically
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
if if it's that small
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
okay representative you look like you
 
00:24:59.450 --> 00:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
had no no you actually asked my question
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
about what number are we talking about
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
with the hold constants yeah
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
as I as I flip through there to hold
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
constants well I can't do the decimal
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
point on the MCO payment so I can't come
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
up with a number either so
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I think I just added it up real
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
quickly and it looks like of the 40
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
million of just about round numbers 10
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
million is being held constant right so
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
you've got one on page one you've got
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
three at the top of page
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
um 2 which is a total of four and then
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
you've got six on page four which is ten
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and the stuff that's at the very end
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's 12 because there's a 2.2
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
million in EMS but it's it's on the
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
order of 10 to 12 million being held
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
constant round numbers
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
um first one degree one significant
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
digit type stuff
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and then the balance of that 40 million
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
which is on the 28 million is what's
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
going to be leveraged for increasing
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
rates so I understand that example
 
00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:06.409 align:start position:0%
rates so I understand that example
thanks

00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:08.390 align:start position:0%
thanks
I

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
I think that just to go back to the why
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
40 million well because we can
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the Senate is at least
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
going to do 40 per year uh
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald I think proposed 145
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
million and I think that was for the
 
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
two-year then then Bradley counter
 
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
proposed 80 million of which it was 40
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
40 and so so I'm trying to trying to
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate and skate to where the puck
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
will be to use the hockey term and I I
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
think I think we'll be in line with the
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
Senate if we're thinking in terms of 40.
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
now I I don't I don't I I wish it were
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
more I wanted to be more and so as we
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
complete our decisions today I would
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
like our priority to be to shift
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
whatever money we can into the Medicaid
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
rate reimbursement number so that
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
there's more more to distribute
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
that that's where I'm coming from
 
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.810 align:start position:0%
that that's where I'm coming from
representative

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
I agree with all that but back to
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
represent representative stringham's
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
point at the beginning so clearly if if
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
if the numbers in the under the 24 and
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
25 change in other words you're changing
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
that proportion so if you all have input
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
there and also the whole constant what
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know is that have we chosen it an
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
inappropriate set to hold a constant so
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
it's if the philosophy works
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
then there can be we can muddle with the
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
rate with the ratios and with what's
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
Constant if that makes sense
 
00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:51.299 align:start position:0%
representative thanks I just have a
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
question for representative do you for
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
the once you pay the hold constants
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
um what's your thought process for
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
Distributing the remainder
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
but that was the ratio part
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
so oh what's figuring out what the ratio
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
is for all the others based on what they
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
hold here for 100 percent
 
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:18.980 align:start position:0%
all right make sense yeah
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
which which that's what I say you you
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
can so you you all we all can impact
 
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
that if we feel the ratios are wrong in
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
other words if you feel like whatever
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
see if I should be getting more a
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
greater percentage of the of the total
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
pot whatever the pot may be then by
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
changing the numbers the ratios you
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
affect that does that make sense
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure it can get pretty complex and and
 
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
basically I think we have about 20
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
minutes before we have to make this
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
decision and we still have to hear from
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham and we need to
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
hear from representative walner now
 
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
no I just I just want to so the 40
 
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
million is per year
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
40 million yes a year thank you I just
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure I understood that
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative stream yeah so uh you
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
know our our Amendment comes out
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
substantially more but more like 75 and
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
100 just rough ballpark numbers
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
um and so you know I hope things like um
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
um if we pass for example the uh the
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
movement of the disability funds that
 
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
that could 100 be a portion to this and
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
and uh that uh that we can reach these
 
00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.250 align:start position:0%
and uh that uh that we can reach these
numbers

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.570 align:start position:0%
numbers
um

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
um can you pass out the the draft of of
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
our Amendment and what it looks like and
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
structured uh so
 
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.730 align:start position:0%
structured uh so
um

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
you know a few of the few of the changes
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
from this for the values
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the disability Community asked for
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
18 but three percent turns out it's
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
already in the budget because three
 
00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.070 align:start position:0%
already in the budget because three
percent

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
um uh used to be taken out of those fees
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
and then given to the area agencies the
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
area agencies are separately
 
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.789 align:start position:0%
area agencies are separately
um

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
paid now with a separate code and line
 
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
item and there was no corresponding
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
decrease in the services line so
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
essentially there was a built-in three
 
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.930 align:start position:0%
percent increase
so

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
um that actually
 
00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:23.870 align:start position:0%
um that actually
um

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:26.299 align:start position:0%
uh you know reduce the budget by about
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
28.6 million so and um so because that
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
number is eerily similar to that's the
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
same 28.6 from the reduction of the
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
three accounts you guys are we're
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
talking about the same thing oh oh you
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
might be right uh that that 28.6 was
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
from the three accounts
 
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.230 align:start position:0%
from the three accounts
um

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I'd have to I'd have to look up
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
and see what that is but it made a
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
significant down down uh size and the uh
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
we had we had already added the home
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
health aids that you talked about that's
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
in that's in our current Amendment
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:07.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh we there's 19 categories of services
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh in here
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
um and if adding in the granite state
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh would um uh added another
 
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.430 align:start position:0%
Advantage uh would um uh added another
uh

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh 5.25 million over two years so we
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
used a 25 kind of reduction using Yuri
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
numbers yesterday uh representative
 
00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:36.649 align:start position:0%
numbers yesterday uh representative
Edwards

00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
um talking with Kevin
 
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.529 align:start position:0%
um talking with Kevin
um

00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh this morning we thought the best way
 
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
to do it actually is for the increases
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
have the first year be 50 of the second
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
year uh because
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
um uh if we just made each one three
 
00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:55.820 align:start position:0%
quarters of the year then
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
they would be limited in how much they
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
could spend in that individual provider
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
category so instead we took them down by
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
50 percent and then took 25 percent said
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
okay here's you can apply these in the
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
first year to whichever uh rate increase
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
you're implementing sooner so that we
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
still end up with it with the same
 
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.490 align:start position:0%
still end up with it with the same
numbers

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:26.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.130 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
has that gone come around so so this
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
this this is a sufficiently uh dense
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
document with a lot of great Concepts in
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
it that I am not able to process could I
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
ask a question yeah
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
are there as many
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numerals on your Amendment as
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
in other words did you account yeah
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
everything's accounted for
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
um that's that's in this document so
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
well basically did you fully find any
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's a better way to put it if if you
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
if you if you're
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
um if you fully fund yours then ours
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
should be should be close to Identity if
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
we fully find everything you mean that's
 
00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
not my asking though yeah did you fully
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
fund all the years are fully funded
 
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
yeah except for we you know we changed
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
the disability by by uh three percent
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
um so it's it used to be 18 was was the
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
ask and we reduced that to 15 okay
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
because there's money elsewhere in the
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
budget okay so we also took out the one
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
and a half million uh for beds uh that's
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
in there because that's also in another
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
part of the budget
 
00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
so it's not needed
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
there's a slight there's a somewhat
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
increase in emergency services for
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh based on a fee schedule uh
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
amount that that
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
um we think is critical uh
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
to bring a Lifeline to that to that
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
troubled business
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
so here's one way of looking at this and
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming your second number in every
 
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.909 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming your second number in every
case

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
is a full Year's value
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's right okay and all of these had
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same value in each year
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
not 100 but is that what sort was that
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
your intent I realize you it's lower
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
because the same reason I lower them but
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
was your intent that if if they could be
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
Zapped to the full amount you know on
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
day one January uh July 1st which intent
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
that it would be equal a year year one
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
year too it would be if you could if you
 
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
could apply it on July 1st it would be
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
equal year to year okay so essentially
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
with with a few exceptions some of them
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
like if you look at the CFI requested
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
rate increase at 7.6 and 9.3
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
you mean you match this
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
right okay so in some sense the
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
your numbers are just the numbers that
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
we could plug in as the ratios if you
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at it that way in other
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
words you have instead of 60 well you
 
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
actually have the same number for the
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
for long-term nursing care so that would
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
be an approach it would obviously would
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
not come out with your 100 million or
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
come out with 40 million but that is an
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
approach that would if you think you
 
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
change the ratios and that's really
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
important and I know the 100 million Top
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
Line number is really important as well
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
but if it's also important that the
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
ratios be somewhat slightly different
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's an easy thing to change
 
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
so so I'll come back to you on that I I
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm again I'm just trying to map this
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
document that I solved for the first
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
time four minutes ago and making sure I
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
understand it on like for example uh
 
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:47.300 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh my my fifth grade teacher will be
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
proud if I get this right it looks like
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid birth rates and non-hospital
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
environments so so because they went for
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand hundred thousand and
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
you're anticipating uh just a percentage
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
in the first year that's you've you've
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
you've kind of respected the request but
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
you've made it 75 100 because you have
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
some assumptions about the rate at which
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
they could spend in the first year
 
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
anyways right they have to um they have
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
to announce changes in fee schedules
 
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.810 align:start position:0%
to announce changes in fee schedules
sometimes

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:31.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
I get all that okay so so now we're at
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
19 on line 35. This appears to be
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
greater than the 2.2 2.2 and so I is
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
that a typo or did something else go
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
into your analysis for ambulances yeah
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
um the the ambulance uh figures which
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a lot more input on
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we we felt that they should
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
be addressed at the service level and
 
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:06.849 align:start position:0%
be addressed at the service level and
that

00:37:06.849 --> 00:37:06.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
just just upping them to the Medicare
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
rates where you know for example last
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
biennium ambulance services were
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
increased to 188 percent of Medicare
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.710 align:start position:0%
because of
um

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
problems with the Medicare fee schedule
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
for this one type of service so
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
um so on on page three at the top the
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
ambulance codes the primary service
 
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.670 align:start position:0%
ambulance codes the primary service
codes

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
a0425 through a0429 we actually set
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
rural and urban urban levels for that
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure I'm just again trying to make sure
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
I'm tracking with what you're thinking
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
and what I think I heard you say is that
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to refer to it as the
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
Moynihan document because I think
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
everyone understands the term but they
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
their their work effort resulted in 2.2
 
00:37:59.290 --> 00:37:59.300 align:start position:0%
and 2.2
 
00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:04.700 align:start position:0%
and so with you've gotten supplemental
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
clarification on that did that also come
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
from the Moynihan effort or did it come
 
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
from something somebody operating
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
outside of the the Moynihan coordination
 
00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:17.450 align:start position:0%
outside of the the Moynihan coordination
Circle

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
Circle
 
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099 align:start position:0%
uh well I think probably both but most
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
of my input comes from talking to
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers who I've been
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
working with on other legislation okay
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
I'm reluctant to do that because I I I I
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
I like the fact that Mr warnahan got
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
everyone together and got everyone
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
looking at the same thing and and and
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
and and and and dismissing just one part
 
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
of it and bringing in external to that
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
it just feels to me you know sort of a
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
bad process but that's just my opinion
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative hole thank you Mr
 
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.410 align:start position:0%
uh representative hole thank you Mr
chair

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
um member question for Mr Stringham
 
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham did you put
 
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
this together in a spreadsheet form
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
anywhere or is this only in the
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
amendment Word document form
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
and if you have it in a spreadsheet can
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
you email it
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll send you what I got but I
 
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.829 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll send you what I got but I
didn't

00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
um but it's pretty much just a number
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
cheat so okay
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
and then another am I is somebody over
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
here wanting to ask questions because
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
I'm looking down mostly
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so on line item 27 I think
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's Roman numeral 16 that's 675 000
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
sounds familiar is is that is that the
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Amendment finding its way
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
into this document as well
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
just because I think 675 was the same
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
number you pitched yesterday
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
and this is substance for Prevention
 
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.430 align:start position:0%
and this is substance for Prevention
Services

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah no so it just happens to be the
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
same number it was well my number is
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
actually 625. right that has nothing to
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
do with this okay
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah this this is on on the um Moynihan
 
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
sheet sud outpatient
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
um uh line at least you know depends
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
which version of this you have but yeah
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
if you use Earth sheet uh representative
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay it's 900 900 and then the first
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
year at this point is three quarters of
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know I you know just as a general
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
statement you know I hope we can come up
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
close to these numbers because I really
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the first way I started is
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
saying well what if we match Medicare
 
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
rates and you know that that a lot of
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
times are pretty um
 
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:38.540 align:start position:0%
uh stingy in some in many fee schedules
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
and you know pretty much we would need
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
the budget of Vermont and Maine on top
 
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
of our budget to bring it up to that
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
level so you know this is this you know
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
we're we're starting from an extremely
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
low level and
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
um uh you know most of this you know is
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much just you know on average a
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh cost of living you know it's 12 12
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know if across the board if we fund
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
it at this level and we have service
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
problems now uh with the rates that we
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
have and if we're going to start you
 
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:15.740 align:start position:0%
know two years then this next biennium
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
at you know a lower real rate than where
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
we start where we uh started the
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
previous biennium I I I think it would
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
uh you know difficult for us to see a
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
kind of across-the-board improvement in
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
service fulfillment so would you believe
 
00:41:37.089 --> 00:41:37.099 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything you just said
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
but but I I also need to worry about we
 
00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:42.470 align:start position:0%
but but I I also need to worry about we
all

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
also have to worry about we can't spend
 
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
money we don't have and and so that that
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
to me that's the issue of how much money
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
we could we have we can stand to invest
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
in this we're already investing more
 
00:41:59.930 --> 00:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
than the governor just talking about it
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
you know so so the governor's budget is
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
higher our Revenue estimates are higher
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
than the ones we're working with so if
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
we take something this significant and
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
add it to the governor's budget
 
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
we have to go back and also be looking
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
for sources of the funds for this so so
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
I I Now understand your your document
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you are there representative
 
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.310 align:start position:0%
thank you are there representative
walner

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
the subject but it's something that I'm
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
seeing here trying to Grapple with
 
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.010 align:start position:0%
seeing here trying to Grapple with
yesterday

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.569 align:start position:0%
yesterday
we

00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
the the DD funding and how we were going
 
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.170 align:start position:0%
the the DD funding and how we were going
to

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
bring forward
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
the lapse basically we were going to
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
bring that forward
 
00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.230 align:start position:0%
bring that forward
and

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
I can't remember how much it was but it
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
seemed like it was around 25 million
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
so how did you account for that in your
 
00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
40 I mean it seems like it's really
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
important that the DD community at least
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
no of course we have don't say we
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
haven't it's right there it's actually
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
higher than your number
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
I mean proportionally it's okay so
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's not higher in an absolute sense
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's higher so you're basically 35 and
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
put in 29. so I just went through your
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
document and a lot of this lines up
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
except it gets into a situation I don't
 
00:43:34.609 --> 00:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
understand some of it but just to go
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
down from the start
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
you've got 16.5 million from nursing
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
homes you've got 9.3 million for CFI
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
which I realized in the first half of
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
the of this one it's actually lower
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
um you've got 2.5 for
 
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
the Assisted Living you've got 966 for
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
the MCO payments in conjunction with the
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid payments you don't have the
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
granite state listing in there yet I
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
don't see it you do have the private
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
duty nurses although I also note that in
 
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
the original document the first year was
 
00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.970 align:start position:0%
the original document the first year was
less

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
um you have the case management at six
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
you got Community Mental Health rates
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
wages at 14 soon is the document you've
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
got the housing at 2.2 million
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
you got the rebasing at four so that's
 
00:44:29.089 --> 00:44:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
and again I'm just saying low with
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
respect to the Monahan document not
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
lower than respect excuse me sorry I'm
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
just trying to wrap my brain you were
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
going down I went too fast you're right
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
you were going down the second set of
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
numbers and then on that last one you
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
switch to the first number
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes you said no she's right because it
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
says zero but we actually switched that
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
to six because at the beginning of the
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
meeting your colleague here explaining
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
to me that it was six both years so
 
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
rebasing was six and six and then the
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
next one does that make sense that's
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral x 10
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
and then I I skipped over 11. that is
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
the um the rate adjustment that is the
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
same 4 million
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then we get to what you I think you
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about representative
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
wellner which is the DD and brain injury
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
which in the document that Monahan
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
provided us was was 35 million and I
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
think well you just explained when you
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
roughly took what we
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
took out if you will yesterday and put
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
it in here the 29 million which that
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
makes sense uh no no that's that's not
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
what she was referring to that's not
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
what I meant Oh No but that is the DD
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
and brain injury what she was taught can
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
I yeah well in case I just want what I'm
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is if uh using your
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
way of doing it they won't get
 
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.990 align:start position:0%
way of doing it they won't get
back

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
the amount they have put in
 
00:45:44.339 --> 00:45:45.349 align:start position:0%
the amount they have put in
from

00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
lapsing over I don't think I don't see
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
unless you well that's probably true the
 
00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:52.859 align:start position:0%
attempt was not to right the whole point
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
of that was not to put it back because
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get spent
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's the idea that was dollars
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
that was sitting at the bank at the end
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
of next year along with monies that
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
won't get spent in the next biennium
 
00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
they have this huge pile of cash sitting
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
in those accounts come
 
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
the 30th of June in 2025 and it seems
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
the point was to in every case here the
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
point was to try to get
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
funds and spend them not necessarily
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
spend the same account but spend them
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid rate adjustments
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
does that make sense so you are taking
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
that to put into your 40 million dollars
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's part of your 40 but it won't
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily be used all for what the DD
 
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
Community okay thank you because I don't
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
think we voted on that yet and I think
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
if we vote on that to take it to take it
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
out that that would go in addition to
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
the 40 million it'll be additional money
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's available to spend however we
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
want to spend it no no
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
okay I do want to finish my leave your
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
list but um to be clear
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
when so the 40 million is a number I
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
just picked out of the air I realize you
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
didn't pick your 200 million out of the
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
year but it's kind of the same thing
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
it's another number
 
00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's another number
um

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
I did that because
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
I wanted to try to get something going
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
here we've sort of been beating around
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
the bushy on this for a long time
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
over the last few days you may have
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
recalled my saying repeatedly let's take
 
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
this out of so we can have more cat more
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
General funds available for this purpose
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
I don't yet know that number even though
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
we've taken a bunch of votes I haven't
 
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
yet seen how much General funds have we
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
freed up is it 200 million is it 80
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
million is it zero okay so it's some
 
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.109 align:start position:0%
million is it zero okay so it's some
number

00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
separate from this
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
does that make sense okay could I just
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
finish on the list because it kind of
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
ran into a part where I where I lost
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
track of what you were doing
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
so so right Roman numeral level I'm
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
equating the 29 million to the 35 so
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's essentially a reduction
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
opioid starts to fall apart on me
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there in the
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the Monahan is is that where you
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
substitute in some numbers or the 40 for
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
4.85 and then the 400 000 or is it does
 
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
some of that fit in with the MedEx
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
population and Medicaid population stuff
 
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:20.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm looking at Roman numerals 13.
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
14. 15 16 I kind of lost track of how
 
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
those tie to
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
the Monahan
 
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.809 align:start position:0%
the Monahan
sure

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:31.819 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
I think I did the same thing that Miss
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
sorry representative erf did which is I
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
took the Moynihan document put 75
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
percent in
 
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
and and multiplied it by column C right
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
just to get us the numbers and then ran
 
00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
down and started looking at differences
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
and there is a significant change
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
starting in line 13 on page two can I
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
explain 13 sure so the opioid treatment
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the one that's blank there's two
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
numbers below if you add those two
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
numbers up that's 13. and the reason why
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
they split it out that way is so that we
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
could see the impact on the fact that
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
some of these are 90 matched and some
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
are 50 percent matched and uh with the
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
with the rough numbers so there it's not
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the opioid treatment wasn't
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for it was accounted for in
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
the next two blocks so those two
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
together make up okay appropriation
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
under 13. so that the Medics and
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
so then continuing you got residential
 
00:49:42.849 --> 00:49:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
and then you've got a mask whatever that
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
is representative Stringham I guess I
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
don't understand sud the difference on
 
00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:53.579 align:start position:0%
La in section Roman numeral 12 right the
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
21.9 that goes to 29 which is a very big
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
difference from the 35 that they had
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh so when um this year or this biennium
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
they're implementing a change to the
 
00:50:08.579 --> 00:50:10.010 align:start position:0%
they're implementing a change to the
disability

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
um developmental disability payments uh
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
the the area agencies which are under
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
contract uh to oversee the management of
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
those systems regionally used to get a
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
three percent payment out of any service
 
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
that was provided to their customers
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
that's the way they got paid this year
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
this this year they're they're going to
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
get paid directly
 
00:50:36.359 --> 00:50:38.210 align:start position:0%
get paid directly
from

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
um uh By You Know by us a fee about
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
three percent but um but there's nothing
 
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:47.660 align:start position:0%
in the there's no they didn't reduce
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
those other payments by the three
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
percent so it'd be even so effectively
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
there was already a three percent
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
increase in the developmentally disabled
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
waiver fee schedule with us doing
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
nothing so giving them 18 or I'm sorry
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
15 percent
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
um uh really three percent was already
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
accounted for in the current budget so I
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
reduced it
 
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
um to just their ask is that helpful
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful thank you
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up your your list and
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
our lists are pretty much the same it
 
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.609 align:start position:0%
our lists are pretty much the same it
appears

00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
appears
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
other than the the you have big totals I
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
have smaller totals but
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
but it does fit in with the philosophy
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
if you it seems like in some case well
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
you held everything constant so I guess
 
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
the question would be if you can buy
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
Into My Philosophy our philosophy
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
um are there some that you would hold
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
constant and some that you would allow
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
to go up or down mostly down mostly down
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
well yeah you know if we don't have
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
enough money and we're trying to reach
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
consensus we have to have some
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
methodology and so but um I'm hopeful we
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
can find enough money that that your
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
your amount percent reduction is zero
 
00:52:12.839 --> 00:52:15.049 align:start position:0%
your amount percent reduction is zero
percent

00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
so so while we keep hope alive I think
 
00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
the question I didn't hear yes or no
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
from you on is the to the question of
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
and Earth has representative erf has
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
proposed some very specific line items
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
that he would hold constant
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
and these are being held constant by a
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
combination of relatively small dollars
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
and relatively High priorities I think
 
00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:47.390 align:start position:0%
and relatively High priorities I think
so

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
so I think I think what we're looking
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
for from from the Democrat Caucus
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
because we did caucus on this is is that
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
these that representative Murph has put
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
here is hold constant we we would like
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
to hold constant and to the extent that
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
there's any variability or difference
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
left that that we would we would talk
 
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
about that later and hopefully find some
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
more money to close the gap
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
so kind of the first pass at this is can
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
you agree with us that I hate this we
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
versus them thing but
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
um but in any case can it be agreed to
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
that uh the the items that says Earth
 
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.910 align:start position:0%
that uh the the items that says Earth
hold

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
hold
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
constant that you can you can buy off on
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
you'd like to talk about that because we
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
a represent a hole
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
before we would break for any potential
 
00:53:52.859 --> 00:53:54.049 align:start position:0%
before we would break for any potential
caucus

00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate what representative
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
Stringham had to say relative to the 15
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
versus 18 versus kind of the three
 
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.589 align:start position:0%
versus 18 versus kind of the three
percent

00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
double Accounting in the DD and brain
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
injury and if I understand his comment
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
correct right the 35 million that was in
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
the Monahan document might actually want
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
to be 29. did I get that correct right
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
and and it says 29 million in Roman
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
numeral 12 uh for the second year of the
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
biennium so that's where that yes okay
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
so trying to be Equitable right because
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
in some cases the percentage increase
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be 18 like we're seeing
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
there we're going to see right 15 across
 
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
um maybe we want to make a tweak to this
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
proposed sheet by representative erf for
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
that line item which is on the top of
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
page five
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm willing to propose that
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
change from the 35 down to 29 which is
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
in keeping with what representative
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
Stringham had to say
 
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.270 align:start position:0%
Stringham had to say
um

00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
I I think it feels to me like we've
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
achieved a point of kind of
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of the two proposals that
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
I believe we should just uh recess for
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
I think it'll take longer than five
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
minutes what do you want I would say
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
probably fifth
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:55:19.079 --> 00:55:20.329 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess to uh 1105. I had
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
in the middle
 
00:55:29.940 --> 01:00:00.890 align:start position:0%
in the middle
okay

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.900 --> 01:12:11.709 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
so sir representative walner I was just
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
waiting for you to come to a natural
 
01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:24.890 align:start position:0%
waiting for you to come to a natural
conclusion

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
um uh recess is over uh time to get back
 
01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
um we we have some more math that that
 
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
Jr or representative hole is doing for
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
us but so I I want to I just want to say
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
where I where I think we are in the
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
total process
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
01:14:50.689 --> 01:14:50.699 align:start position:0%
the governor's team had many many months
 
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
to come up with a proposal to Target
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
some rates
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and didn't but encouraged us to do so
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
so this committee basically is the first
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
time in this budget cycle that anyone
 
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:10.460 align:start position:0%
has tried to do the rate targeting
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
the the effort
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that was undertaken in the private
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
sector and we were referring to Mr
 
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
Moynihan as as the the creator of the
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
Moynihan spreadsheet
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
um obviously uh deserve a lot of credit
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure there were 10 20 people
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that helped give us
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
this spreadsheet that we have all used
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
to normalize our thinking about what we
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
um so so I think that's good we've
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
gotten Community input we've considered
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
it uh and uh and further to the point I
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
think representative stringham's
 
01:15:53.159 --> 01:15:55.130 align:start position:0%
think representative stringham's
initiative

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
to uh transfer the Moynihan document
 
01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.380 align:start position:0%
to uh transfer the Moynihan document
into

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:00.390 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.890 align:start position:0%
into
[Music]

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:01.810 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:01.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.370 align:start position:0%
um
hb2

01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:03.380 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
is is is positive we we have some
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion on the amounts
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
and and we'll we'll share those with you
 
01:16:14.649 --> 01:16:14.659 align:start position:0%
with with you all here after
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative whole does the math but
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to be the same
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
ours are going to be lower
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
um and we kind of knew that but but the
 
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
but the good news is I think we can send
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
something along in the process where the
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
Senate isn't going to have to invent the
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
wheel because I think we've invented a
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
wheel here on how we're trying to do
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
these Medicaid targeted rate increases
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
and I think we should feel kind of good
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
about that but but in any case we're
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to give them our idea our
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
methodology our contact information
 
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
and and that should help I think this is
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to end up at the end of this
 
01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
process with Medicaid targeted rate
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
increases that you know probably
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
everyone can live with so
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to say I I I like the
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
process I I although we're not going to
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
end up agreeing today on the amount I I
 
01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
don't think it's essential that we do
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
anyways because the process continues
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
and the Senate has different numbers are
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
going to look at anyways so are you how
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
far away are you
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to stall anymore on
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take my shot at describing
 
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
the concept of what we're doing
 
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
and uh and then and then hopefully the
 
01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:48.500 align:start position:0%
numbers will be ready by then
 
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.149 align:start position:0%
numbers will be ready by then
I

01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
our concept is that we're we're gonna
 
01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:56.060 align:start position:0%
we're gonna you know take the the
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
boilerplate of The Proposal the
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that Scott Wallner tolerski
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
Stringham and nordgren we're going to
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
take take your Amendment we're going to
 
01:18:08.209 --> 01:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
accept this Baseline
 
01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
um add a little bit more flexibility in
 
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
here because the way this is currently
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
written is that
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
um there's there's sort of these
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
artificial uh buckets where uh we're
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're creating some inflexibility and so
 
01:18:32.689 --> 01:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
in order to give the department more
 
01:18:32.699 --> 01:18:34.850 align:start position:0%
in order to give the department more
flexibility

01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
one of our key Concepts is to take take
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's being
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
proposed like let's say I'll I'll do
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
line 16 because I think maybe I can do
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
the math accurately there's there's
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
there's 15 million
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
that you propose in
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
line two or line 16 rather between the
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
two-year biennium
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
what what we'd like to do to give the
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
department more flexibility than what's
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
is to say okay
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair go
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not Am I Wrong well I'm not sure
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
if that's the intent behind the math I I
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
think I'm not done though well no I know
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
but but biennium total I believe would
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
be 18.6
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
I'm saying on line 16 5.7 to plus 9.3 is
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
15 million I'm just trying to explain
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
the flexibility part of this I know what
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do but we have to
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
clarified Mr Ripple so the number he's
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
starting with should be the full as
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
though it was
 
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing the math on
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
can I can I suggest a structure for the
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
resulting Amendment I'm going to go
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
ahead and finish because I I think I've
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
heard you I think I've got the process
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
and I I think I'm going to get there so
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
so to follow this example just a little
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
bit further on line 16 there's 15
 
01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
million in the total in the two years
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
of that 15 million to 25 of that total
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
would go would be sort of the earmarked
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
for Year One
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of that 50 50 15 million
 
01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:25.580 align:start position:0%
would be earmarked in two in year two
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
which leaves another 25 and then I
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
understand Mr Ripple can write language
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
so that if the department is able to
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
implement the other 25 earlier
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
then they can do that is is is that the
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
structure that we discussed that's
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
exactly correct and it's also the
 
01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
structure that I suggested to
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham uh earlier this
 
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
morning so he will also have another
 
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
version of his Amendment coming forward
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
that does the same thing I would suggest
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
that in the case of Roman 2
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
that's not the clearest example because
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
there were supposed to be two different
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
amounts in the two different years CFI
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
had two different amounts in 24 and 25
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
um if you took an example like
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
let's say on line 28
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
that was originally intended to be 600
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
000 per full year for each of the two
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
full years
 
01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:23.060 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal 25 you would keep this
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
assuming you kept these numbers which
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
they will change
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
but if you kept these numbers in fiscal
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
25 there would be 600 000 appropriated
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 24 there would be
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
300 000 appropriated
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
for the second half of the year
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
150 000 and an equivalent figure for all
 
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
of these amounts and appropriate it in
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
one lump sum to the department to
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
implement rate increases earlier than
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
January 1st if possible okay so the key
 
01:21:59.930 --> 01:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
distinction of what I said and what
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that rather than keep
 
01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:06.500 align:start position:0%
the extra 25 percent floater money
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
associated with each account you'd pull
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
them all out and give flexibility for
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
that cumulative number across all the
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
accounts that's correct
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
I understand that okay representative
 
01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
Waller Okay Kevin
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
a rate increase on January 1.
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes everybody would get a rate increase
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
on January 1. right and then there would
 
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
be this pool of money
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
that some providers or maybe all
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
providers would get an additional
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:50.510 align:start position:0%
amount of money
as

01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:22:53.209 --> 01:22:53.219 align:start position:0%
the department was able to make those
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
allocations yes
 
01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
I think I've got it thank you
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm still representative norgren
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and then can we have
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
a comment from the Department after we
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
figure out what you're saying and what
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
everyone is agreeing to we we can
 
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
solicit a comment yes I I I I I I just
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
want to finish the the train of thought
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
here and okay so so what I would say is
 
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.450 align:start position:0%
here and okay so so what I would say is
that

01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
if we can agree to this past discussion
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
about adding the flexibility then the
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
the red approach
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
to this bill and the blue approach are
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
compatible now we we've agreed to agree
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
with each other on the structure
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
the only difference that we haven't
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
talked about yet are the numbers and and
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
that conversation is coming but I just
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that I think we've
 
01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
agreed to agree on the the framework
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
so I think what what you're the way I
 
01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying is the framework
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
is the fact that every Roman numeral one
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
two three four and five is the same in
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
both proposals and
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
um not the same number but the same
 
01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:16.790 align:start position:0%
um not the same number but the same
topic

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
and uh the Roman numeral relates to the
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
same topic yes and uh so there's an
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation part where we're amending
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
um HB to line 257 uh together or or um
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the same way so there's at least
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of structural close similarity
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh between the two bills or two
 
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
amendments and and I'm seeking agreement
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
on the framework of the structure and
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
and I I kind of think we've got it and
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
and if if we don't then I probably not
 
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
explained it properly but I'm trying I'm
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
trying to hit the same structure
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
do you are you hearing the same
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
structure I am I think the in my mind
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
the only question that remains is
 
01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.630 align:start position:0%
the only question that remains is
whether

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
the resulting amendment should replace
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
the existing section 257 or be in
 
01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
addition to it
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative verft do you have a
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
opinion on that
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what is it what is existing
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
one 257 is the 17 million per year for
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
across the board rate increases yeah
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
interesting you should bring that up so
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
apparently from what I understand
 
01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
speaking of Representative Stringham
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
their plan did not include they were
 
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
starting from a baseline of zero whereas
 
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
we were starting from a baseline of
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
the 17 million but netted out by the
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
hospital piece which I think worked out
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
to about a 7 million so I'm actually
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable going either way it doesn't
 
01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:47.219 align:start position:0%
really matter to my mind because the
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
idea is if we start from a baseline of
 
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
zero as I I understood them to have done
 
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
then the 17 million is part of what can
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
go towards the 40 million which might
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
actually get us up more like to 57
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
million or 50 million or whatever
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
with this distributed approach as
 
01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:02.900 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
what I thought our philosophy was and I
 
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
thought actually the whole group's
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
philosophy but I guess I was mistaken
 
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
that the 3.1 percent wanted to be
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
assured that it went across the board so
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're what we're saying
 
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
here is do we just take that across the
 
01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
board thing out and I honestly don't
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
know what the impact of that is because
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this includes
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
every rate that should be increased or
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
just the ones that are really important
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of what you're what
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
we're deciding here in other words other
 
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
people that would get a 3.1 raise
 
01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:32.219 align:start position:0%
outside of this
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
or not and should they so so my
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
assumption throughout throughout this
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
has been that that we accept the 3.1
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
percent Baseline and that everything
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is an incremental
 
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
addition to that the the thing that we
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
learned in the discussion though was
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
because the hospital was willing to not
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
forego their portion of the 3.1 percent
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
we could either either like like
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
just account for it in what we're doing
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
with with the rate increases by freeing
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
up the hospital's portion and adding it
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
to the 40.
 
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
I would add it to the 40.
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
well that that's part of the problem but
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
the first the first question we need to
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
answer is
 
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
do we exclusive of the hospitals
 
01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:31.340 align:start position:0%
do we want to give an across the board
 
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
3.1 rate increase I have said yes and I
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I agree with that but I believe the
 
01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
other folks have a different perspective
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
and even if we agree to that
 
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
do we know how to express that
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
in we'd have to modify the 250 7
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
language to express that as well so
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
first of all exclude the hospitals and
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
give everybody else across the board and
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
then tack this onto it
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead and I think you could easily do
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
that by reducing the Appropriations from
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
17 million per year to 12 and saying
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
that the rate increases shall exclude
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
hospital inpatient and Hospital
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient services
 
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
so then we'd be amending 257
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
and then that whatever we're proposing
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
to do with the this this structure that
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
we've seen today this would be a new hb2
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
item that should be close to the number
 
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
257. it could be included
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
it could be included or it could be a
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
new section either way a new section but
 
01:28:31.729 --> 01:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
its own section we're making a new
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
section yep okay our Mr chair I think we
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
still need to come to some agreement
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
with the with the whole group do we are
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
we do we do the across the board 3.1
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
percent exclusive of the hospitals or do
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
we not do that because I believe the
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
other folks just so representative
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
you're and I are in agreement I'm just
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
more methodical about how we're getting
 
01:28:54.239 --> 01:28:55.790 align:start position:0%
more methodical about how we're getting
there

01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay but I do incur I do support the
 
01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
encouragement because we're going in the
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
very same direction
 
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.070 align:start position:0%
very same direction
so

01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
if you all understand what we're talking
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
about on 257
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to do is leave 257 alone
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we're recommending an amendment to
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
it to reduce the numbers from 17 million
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
in each of the two years to 12 million
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
the difference between the 17 and the 12
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
is the amount that the hospital said
 
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
they don't need in this go around
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
so this 257 the amounts would change and
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
we'd we'd have to write in a provision
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
to make it exclusive of the hospital
 
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:39.410 align:start position:0%
to make it exclusive of the hospital
portions

01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
portions
 
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
so so that takes care of that and then
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
what what we would like to do then is to
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
add as a new section
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
um this you know if not the the Walnut
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
tolersky Stringham Northern Amendment
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know our our vision of using your
 
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
structure with different numbers
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
so so when we get done with this
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be two sections dealing with
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases
 
01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.270 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases
257

01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
257
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
and so it's in a new number so comment
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
so basically we have we'd have 24
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
million left in in um
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the existing line item there and
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
the question is whether a hundred
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
percent of that would apply to the
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
services that we currently describe uh
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
in this new Amendment or not and um if
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
if it is a hundred percent described
 
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
then the final number should come out
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
identical and I have no estimate of how
 
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
much whether whether there's any minor
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
services that haven't been Incorporated
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh in in the rate increase request so
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
um that might present a bit of a
 
01:30:59.330 --> 01:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
challenge for you know doing a final
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
determination but we'd be looking
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
probably at only a few million per year
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
Max difference so and and I I do think
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
that structure is a little bit harder to
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
to follow mathematically but
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
we can get there we have to might the
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
sure Mr Lipman are you following all
 
01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
this I mean this is all pretty detailed
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
and gnarly
 
01:31:28.139 --> 01:31:33.490 align:start position:0%
and gnarly
um

01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so so let's break this into two
 
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.530 align:start position:0%
yeah so so let's break this into two
sections

01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
the first section and it may be three
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
sections the first section is I just
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
want to deal with the proposal that for
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
257 we reduce the amounts from 17 to 12
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
in each year freeing up five per year
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
from the hospitals to put back in as
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
other rate increases Above and Beyond in
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
other words we're trying to give
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
everyone their what they're expecting
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
because the media has been saying 3.1
 
01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
percent right so so I want to be able to
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
stick our finger in something to say
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay there's that 3.1 percent that we've
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
been promising you in the media for six
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
months so so just on that section
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
are you what are your what are your
 
01:32:22.199 --> 01:32:24.410 align:start position:0%
are you what are your what are your
thoughts

01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
with that number I guess the only
 
01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:27.709 align:start position:0%
with that number I guess the only
um

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
subtlety on it was weather and those
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
brought up by representative Stringham
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
was well the DME was included because in
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal it was just
 
01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.750 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal it was just
services

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk about that earlier
 
01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
because I rep and I'll tell you why I I
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
because as I was looking at this trying
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
to understand the framework
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
I noticed that the Disposable medical
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
equipment in the pharmacy amounts
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
weren't in here and those were topics
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
that represented Stringham suggested
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
initially and not being in his amendment
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
I just assumed that you would either
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
want to deal with them separately or not
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think uh the conclusion
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
we had from the other hearing that any
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments in the DME in Pharmacy
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh expenditures were accounted for
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
separately in the budget
 
01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:20.450 align:start position:0%
separately in the budget
so

01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that they're not accounted
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
for there's no increase planned for
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
um rates we do have inflation Factor
 
01:33:31.729 --> 01:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
built into the Medicaid rates for
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
General Medical inflation to cover the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
cost of do drugs and things like that
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a rate increase
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that's consistent with the the
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and the DME portion I
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
I believe you said something like the
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
the rate of inflation in DME is pretty
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know pretty close to zero because
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
their standard you know type of type of
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
items and they haven't been
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh being modified much is that right
 
01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
uh being modified much is that right
um

01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
my testimony was a little bit different
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
than that it was that um that there's a
 
01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
lot of commoditization and that we have
 
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
a fee schedule that under our Managed
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
Care program that requires to pay at
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
least 80 percent of the Medicaid fee
 
01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:16.550 align:start position:0%
least 80 percent of the Medicaid fee
schedule

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
um and so that I mean that's that's kind
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
of that was my testimony
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and that it would probably cost to
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
bring it up to 100 of the fee schedule
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere around three million dollars
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
to to bring it up to 100 that was what I
 
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
had testified when I did the budget
 
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.629 align:start position:0%
had testified when I did the budget
presentation

01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
do you if we were to take those two
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
accounts Pharmacy and DME
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
and applied 3.1 percent to that
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
then that would be less than the 5
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
million that the hospital is freeing up
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
I think it would cover DME Pharmacy I
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a different story and I think
 
01:34:59.689 --> 01:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
would not suggest to to if you were to
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
do something there would be around the
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
dispensing rates not the the underlying
 
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
product itself
 
01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:08.470 align:start position:0%
product itself
foreign

01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:10.250 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
go ahead can I ask a clarifying question
 
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
so are there any other
 
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
providers outside of what's in this list
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
in other words do we need to worry about
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent because they're already
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
gonna they're already they're all
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
included in here
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
the for services they're included
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
oh so that any any rate
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
that we needed to adjust is included in
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
that that figure that the governor had
 
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:40.860 align:start position:0%
suggested so let me ask a question
 
01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:42.980 align:start position:0%
different way as
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
257 exists now
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
as it exists now
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
outside of anybody that would be
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
included in here
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
would anybody get more money
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
yes who
 
01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.490 align:start position:0%
yes who
um

01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of uh say Aba
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
providers as an example
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
um that provide the therapy for people
 
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
okay so so there is a list so there
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
isn't and there wasn't intention then to
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
get that 3.1 percent for all services
 
01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.510 align:start position:0%
get that 3.1 percent for all services
okay

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to taking 257
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
trimming it from 17 to a year to 12 and
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
adding the provision that the 12 is not
 
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
intended to include the hospitals
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
service providers as as part of 257. is
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
there any opposition to that I I'm not
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
looking for a way to
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
take that five million and five million
 
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
to 10 million and not spend it on
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases I'm just saying
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
that this is intended to be our
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of the 3.1 promise that's
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
been floating around
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to that
 
01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
I just want to understand where the
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
house the hospitals will get the 3.1 no
 
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
so you're taking the you're taking that
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
completely away
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
and okay I was just looking at the first
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
rate sheet we got thank you
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
so so that was a question do you have
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
any opposition to The Proposal
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
so the 12 million would be the
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
difference of taking the hospitals out
 
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
of that plan okay thank you
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
and and the testimony is really clear
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're okay with that and and
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
so that finds US 10 million to go into
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
this this independent rate increase
 
01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.790 align:start position:0%
this this independent rate increase
exercise

01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
and the other thing it does is that it
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
reduces all these numbers
 
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
by the amount that the current 12 and 12
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
would provide just because we already we
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
had included the 17 and 17. uh as you
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
know starting from zero so now we're not
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to be starting from zero for for
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
those types of providers or we could do
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
language saying uh that uh including the
 
01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:28.820 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent this is how much uh
 
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are allowed for these
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
groups is it Kevin does that make sense
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
so so my intent has always been to use a
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent as a Baseline and the
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
Monahan document as the incremental
 
01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
supplement above and beyond the 3.1
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
percent and when we receive this
 
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
document I tried to ask the question is
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
this above and beyond the 3.1 percent or
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
did you anticipate the 3.1 percent in
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
these estimates I thought I heard an
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
answer but now that I now that you're
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
right here welcome from Puerto Rico
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
do you do you just want to tell us come
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
on up
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:15.179 align:start position:0%
um you're not nearly 10 enough
 
01:39:19.450 --> 01:39:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet that the group put
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
together uh started from zero it didn't
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
well that's that's kind of happy news
 
01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:42.659 align:start position:0%
because I I've been seeing it a
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
different way I've seen this above and
 
01:39:47.689 --> 01:39:47.699 align:start position:0%
beyond the 3.1 percent and you've got
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent included in these
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
numbers so some something tiny like you
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
know the midwives for a hundred thousand
 
01:39:58.850 --> 01:39:58.860 align:start position:0%
dollars you're you already anticipated
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
at a hundred thousand some some amount
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
on that hundred thousands that include
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent to their rate was
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
already included in this hundred
 
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to that is no
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
um if you read the explanations for each
 
01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:20.780 align:start position:0%
of these sections so for example on the
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
nursing home for example it was based
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
upon recapturing 50 of the budget
 
01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
neutrality so we so the WC here of 16.5
 
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
million that presumed that
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
did not presume any portion of the 17
 
01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.330 align:start position:0%
did not presume any portion of the 17
million

01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:42.659 align:start position:0%
okay so if we gave the 16.5 that's
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
suggested here plus the 3.1 percent they
 
01:40:49.129 --> 01:40:49.139 align:start position:0%
would end up better than what you all
 
01:40:49.139 --> 01:40:50.590 align:start position:0%
would end up better than what you all
intended

01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
that you all requested yeah if you fully
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
if you took section 257 down to the 12
 
01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.530 align:start position:0%
if you took section 257 down to the 12
million

01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
took 10 and took those two fives and
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
pushed it into you know this chart you
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
know I think you start getting closer to
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
the Walmart
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
at all number
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
um by doing that so
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the and some of the
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
small ones they may do better you're
 
01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay no I I think I get it do
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
you get it
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
so one question could could we handle
 
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
this just by saying all non-hospital
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
services not mentioned uh in this
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
provision shall re receive an increase
 
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
of 3.1 percent effective July 1. 20 uh
 
01:41:36.179 --> 01:41:41.410 align:start position:0%
of 3.1 percent effective July 1. 20 uh
2023

01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple I I think you're in the best
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
position to answer that did you hear the
 
01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.930 align:start position:0%
position to answer that did you hear the
question

01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:51.179 align:start position:0%
I did I that is something that you could
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes you could write that in and it would
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
have that result I guess the question is
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
what amounts would you want to
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that appropriate for
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
that and how would it work in the
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
context of the overall Amendment but yes
 
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
you could do it
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
and you probably couldn't do it on July
 
01:42:07.209 --> 01:42:07.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure I would ask HHS to
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that but if you're treating
 
01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
it like everything else on this
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it would go into effect
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
January 1st or earlier if possible
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
so kind of it could be a no later than
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
one January 24 and if they can do it
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
earlier they can do it earlier
 
01:42:27.659 --> 01:42:29.450 align:start position:0%
earlier they can do it earlier
yes

01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
so what what I like about that is IT
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
addresses you know should somebody have
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
been left uh left out inadvertently that
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
at least say at least in this law they
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
get 3.1 percent and we think it's a
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
pretty small number but but yeah so so
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
back to the question is there any
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
opposition to The Proposal
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
because I want I'd like to take a Strava
 
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
without representative Weiler here and I
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
want to know if I'm walking into a trap
 
01:42:59.689 --> 01:42:59.699 align:start position:0%
are you including what represents I'm
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
just talking about 257 right now that I
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
want to get a 257 moved
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
and we've talked about the concept A few
 
01:43:07.619 --> 01:43:08.629 align:start position:0%
and we've talked about the concept A few
times

01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead well I mean it could include
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
what he just said which is
 
01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.219 align:start position:0%
all all that's going to apply to is
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
those that are not hospitals and not
 
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:18.980 align:start position:0%
otherwise included in here
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
these no this this is this is going to
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
be incremental right now we're just
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
dealing with the 3.1 percent across the
 
01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
board exclusive of hospitals we're going
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with the the the the amendment
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
as a new section
 
01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying I just
 
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
want to take into consideration I don't
 
01:43:39.129 --> 01:43:39.139 align:start position:0%
think that's what representative
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
I think he did he just added one July
 
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know that we can do one
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
July representative Edwards well no I
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
think the key thing the key thing was
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
including in this one Amendment all the
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
services that get rate increases so if
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
we do it this way we don't have to
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
change any of these other other numbers
 
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
we don't have to try to back out how
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
much 3.1 percent is of the assisted
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
living facility I don't want to back
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
them out I want to I want to establish
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
the base and I want to add to it with
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
the new section that's that's what I'm
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get done
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess what I'm saying is 3.1
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
percent you have you if you're adding to
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent to get to two and a half
 
01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.090 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent to get to two and a half
million

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
then how much of that was 3.1 percent
 
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
because you're saying okay that other
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
thing was already accounted for in this
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
other other segment of hb2 because the
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
Deltas between this spreadsheet and
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
anything that would be 3.1 percent are
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
so small
 
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
I would just basically assume it into
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
the math and and just still still work
 
01:44:45.490 --> 01:44:45.500 align:start position:0%
off of this spreadsheet
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh targeted increases
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
just trying to keep it simple
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know let's let's just go ahead and
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
meet our commitment to the 3.1 percent
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
promise across the board and get that
 
01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
all out of out of the way and then we
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
can figure out on the one hand
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet using your framework
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
you know how much we can agree to on the
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
line items so two steps is there any
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to modifying 257 as we've
 
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
discussed which is to keep the 3.1
 
01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:19.910 align:start position:0%
discussed which is to keep the 3.1
percent

01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
change the numbers from 17 to 12.
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
exclusive of hospitals all services
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I don't mean to
 
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
just for clarity there was one group of
 
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
providers that were not on the
 
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that would be captured by
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
your example of 3.1 percent it's a small
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
group but it's Physician Services so we
 
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
had talked to the medical society about
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
this and so here's the good news Mr
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
morning by keeping 257 a general in all
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
services exclusive of hospitals those
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
Strays there may be even a second one
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
that you don't know but if there's any
 
01:45:59.410 --> 01:45:59.420 align:start position:0%
Strays they'll all get the 3.1 percent
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry I was I was busy on a
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so that ends up totaling at
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
12 million instead of 17. right because
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
we're assuming the number 5 million per
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
year is the hospital was the hospital
 
01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
share thank you
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to 257 is
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
discussed do you know do you know what
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted I want to do with 257 do you
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
I think since you have to write it I
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
think all you want to do with 257 is
 
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
reduce the appropriation from 17 to 12
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
per year and exclude hospital inpatient
 
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
and outpatient services that's all I
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.149 align:start position:0%
want to do
oh

01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry I thought that um
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't have 257 in front of me
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:04.139 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at 257 and it doesn't
 
01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
actually say 3.1 percent anywhere so I
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
guess my
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that it's also
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
that it's going to account for the 3.1
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
percent across the board less the
 
01:47:19.609 --> 01:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are foregoing theirs
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think representative Stringham has
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that and doing it perhaps a
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
different way I think
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong and I think
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards wants to subtract
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
5 million from the total exclude
 
01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
hospitals but leave the section
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise as is
 
01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:35.510 align:start position:0%
otherwise as is
okay

01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
and then we can have a totally separate
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
conversation that'll be just as
 
01:47:48.530 --> 01:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
scintillating as this one on the I'll
 
01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
where where it's almost identical we're
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
accepting the framework with some some
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
extra flexibility are just our numbers
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
are just going to be different
 
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.310 align:start position:0%
are just going to be different
so

01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
now I have to wait for my advice chair
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
do you have any opposition
 
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative Waller are you opposed
 
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.109 align:start position:0%
representative Waller are you opposed
no

01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
I think the worry is just how exactly is
 
01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
this all worded such that it's clear how
 
01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
much money goes to each type of
 
01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
providers and until it's all written out
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be it's going to be two
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
different so so the way this always
 
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
turns out we we kind of talk about it we
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
agree on the concept we charge Mr Ripple
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
to go to OLS we get paperwork back we
 
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
read the actual language and then we can
 
01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
revisit it if it's not what we think we
 
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
yes I think that we need to see it in
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
writing so but it's a concept you're
 
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay with the concept so we can
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
authorize him to get going with OLS
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
I think we can taking out the three
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
taking out the hospital from the from
 
01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.290 align:start position:0%
taking out the hospital from the from
257

01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
257
 
01:49:12.050 --> 01:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
I think we are okay with that
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
also by taking it out you've taken out
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.330 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

01:49:25.330 --> 01:49:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
sure thanks I just wanted to ask a
 
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
question and I know we're going to get
 
01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
to this because you're directing us to
 
01:49:33.649 --> 01:49:33.659 align:start position:0%
the this amendment that we're going to
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
work from but I am curious if
 
01:49:38.689 --> 01:49:38.699 align:start position:0%
representative erf on your spreadsheet
 
01:49:39.649 --> 01:49:39.659 align:start position:0%
that you were working on from the
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
Monahan Amendment were you guys looking
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
at any of the um can we not have that
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
conversation right now it's this is
 
01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:48.659 align:start position:0%
confusing enough I'm trying to take baby
 
01:49:48.659 --> 01:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
confusing enough I'm trying to take baby
steps

01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
steps
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
keep everyone on 257 let's get that vote
 
01:49:56.330 --> 01:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
and your question will have a great
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity once we bring up the second
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
half of this
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
all right so uh I move
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
that we accept
 
01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
257 with the concept being
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
what we've discussed several times
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
already that we exclude the hospitals
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
which drops to 17 million a year to 12
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
million in each year and otherwise
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's intended to make keep our
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
commitment on 3.1 percent across the
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
board on all services
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
if you are in favor of that you will
 
01:50:41.209 --> 01:50:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay and no one's opposed so so that's
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
that's nailed down
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
now we're going to bring up the second
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
part which is the you want to call it
 
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
the Waller framework is that because you
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
didn't like the Stringham framework
 
01:51:02.649 --> 01:51:02.659 align:start position:0%
okay the Stringham framework on on
 
01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
1121 Hotel eleven Twenty One
 
01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:07.970 align:start position:0%
1121 Hotel eleven Twenty One
okay

01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
what what are your questions
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative I was serious
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
getting two in
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
two and to go back to the original
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
philosophy that representative erf had
 
01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:20.900 align:start position:0%
and my question to him would have been
 
01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
on the categories that had blanks ones
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
that I know my side of the table dug
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
deep in over the weekend trying to fill
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
in those blanks
 
01:51:33.649 --> 01:51:33.659 align:start position:0%
were you considering any of those or
 
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:35.699 align:start position:0%
just taking them as zeros in terms of
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
what totals you were looking at the
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
moment I noticed that you didn't keep a
 
01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
zero was not blank it was zero that's
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Meals on Wheels I didn't
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
see any places that were blank that you
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
included but it says raise the rate we
 
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
were we ran numbers on how to raise the
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
rate on that so page two there's an
 
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
adult medical day rate that's blank what
 
01:51:57.649 --> 01:51:57.659 align:start position:0%
Roman numerals page two I'm looking at
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet correct okay but what
 
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral is that on yours on this
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
one yeah Meals on Wheels uh Meals on
 
01:52:06.290 --> 01:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
Wheels I know that's a different one
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels was not blank it was
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
Zero well it was it was Zero but there
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
was a note that said they wanted to
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
raise that they needed to raise it okay
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
I get that and so the answer is that one
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
no but are there any that were blank
 
01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
that you included no medical day is
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
blank adult yeah and where's that in
 
01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative Stringer do you remember
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
where we so whoever's here for CFI stand
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
by because because we're going to come
 
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
to that in just a moment did Mr Monahan
 
01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.250 align:start position:0%
to that in just a moment did Mr Monahan
leave

01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay I don't need him yet but I will
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
need him not on him yet
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
so Mr or representative right the zero
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
that showed up in that spreadsheet
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
actually had a number it was just it was
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
a quarter but it didn't
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
it was a number of significant digits
 
01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
shown that feel free to sub it in but my
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
point was I was pretty sure that there
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
were no blanks that you included over
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
here that's all I'm saying Meals on
 
01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:06.659 align:start position:0%
Wheels we can stick that in there I I
 
01:53:06.659 --> 01:53:09.229 align:start position:0%
Wheels we can stick that in there I I
concur

01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
I don't remember specifically but I know
 
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner was
 
01:53:14.169 --> 01:53:14.179 align:start position:0%
tracking down
 
01:53:16.609 --> 01:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
different numbers you got them all I
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right then I
 
01:53:19.070 --> 01:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that that was all my
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
clarification wanted to make sure that
 
01:53:23.209 --> 01:53:23.219 align:start position:0%
we were both looking at the same amount
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
of numbers okay are you ready I'm ready
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
numbers if people want to okay I don't
 
01:53:31.609 --> 01:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
want to go through the exercise of of
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
reading the 42 numbers you're about to
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
read so so can we is it something that
 
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
can be photocopied and handed out uh I
 
01:53:41.689 --> 01:53:41.699 align:start position:0%
will send the spreadsheet over to Mr
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
Ripple and he can with tweaks to this we
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
can make it but I have something that
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
works out the 40.1 million dollars and
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
it holds the Earth sections constant and
 
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:53.870 align:start position:0%
it holds the Earth sections constant and
it

01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
um increases all the others at an equal
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
percentage and includes a small increase
 
01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:02.219 align:start position:0%
for what was zero on the Monahan sheet
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
that was originally handed out which
 
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
really wasn't zero it was just only one
 
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
significant digit for some reason so
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's actually 250 000 and that one has
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
an 80 thousand dollar increase but when
 
01:54:17.410 --> 01:54:17.420 align:start position:0%
all said and done we are
 
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
effectively at 40 million dollars
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
could I ask Mr Monahan just one question
 
01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
sure Mr Monahan Mr Monahan you got two
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
mics if you could turn one off and turn
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of rows that have
 
01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:36.179 align:start position:0%
differing numbers like for instance
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
private duty nursing shows 2.6 in uh in
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
24 and then 5.3 and in the following
 
01:54:47.590 --> 01:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
uh there's a person waving their hand
 
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
behind you yeah I think Lauren probably
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
knows better than I do maybe if she
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
morning it's uh Laura McIntyre for she
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
and Finney Capital group and
 
01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
representing the home health and hospice
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
Association for the private duty nurses
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why we have two different
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
numbers is we were anticipating that we
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to have the utilization be it the
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
same that it was an FY 22 or I believe
 
01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
and uh the point of that was just to
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of stabilize the program the second
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
number which is larger is to grow the
 
01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:28.070 align:start position:0%
number which is larger is to grow the
program

01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:31.970 align:start position:0%
program
foreign

01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
follow up the other place that that
 
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
disparity change shows up as CFI right
 
01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
every all the other numbers in this
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet are your
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 are the same
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
is it the same rationale representative
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:55:56.090 --> 01:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
the 5 million per year that we just
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
pulled out of 257. what effect does that
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
have on the 40 that we're seeing on on
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
your spreadsheet does that make it
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
effectively 45 or do does it keep it at
 
01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:08.689 align:start position:0%
effectively 45 or do does it keep it at
40.

01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
40.
 
01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
it has no effect in the following sense
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
the 40 has nothing behind it it's
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
literally a number I pulled out of the
 
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
air now it was kind of related to a
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
number you pulled out but the point is
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
that that's it
 
01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:24.020 align:start position:0%
at some point and I'm hoping very soon
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to see the impact of all
 
01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
these votes we've taken the DD piece
 
01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
yesterday the uh what we just did right
 
01:56:32.699 --> 01:56:34.070 align:start position:0%
yesterday the uh what we just did right
here

01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:56:36.169 --> 01:56:36.179 align:start position:0%
um the uh there's been a whole bunch of
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
votes we've taken where we've taken
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
things out of the governor's budget and
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
those GF funds and those should all add
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
up to a bucket and I don't know how big
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
that bucket is maybe somebody here does
 
01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219 align:start position:0%
but it's that bucket that I'm looking
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
for to get the job so the 40 is a
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
placeholder until we get better detail
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to suspend this if I'd like
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
to suspend this conversation CFI has
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
been waiting representative waller or
 
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
Weller well I'll try one more time
 
01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
Weiler had some questions yesterday for
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
CFI so so they've been invited and he's
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
running back and forth he's got three
 
01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:16.580 align:start position:0%
divisions he's running around then so so
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:57:21.649 --> 01:57:21.659 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll wait till the person
 
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
comes to the mic
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking between nursing home and
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
CFI and I know there's a lot of empty
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
nursing home beds so if somebody comes
 
01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
that needs a bed do they automatically
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
hi good morning my name is Wendy Altman
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm the bureau chief of the Bureau
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
of elderly and Adult Services
 
01:58:02.639 --> 01:58:03.310 align:start position:0%
of elderly and Adult Services
um

01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
I can describe to you what we experience
 
01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
and what we see with individuals who
 
01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:11.450 align:start position:0%
and what we see with individuals who
um

01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
end up needing to have long-term
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
supports and services whether that's in
 
01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:17.900 align:start position:0%
the community or a nursing facility
 
01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:20.050 align:start position:0%
the community or a nursing facility
typically

01:58:20.050 --> 01:58:20.060 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
individuals may experience depending on
 
01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
the nursing facility they want to apply
 
01:58:30.729 --> 01:58:30.739 align:start position:0%
to or go to
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
waiting and we oftentimes will work with
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
them to
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
um assist with the choices for
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
Independence waiver program if they have
 
01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
the eligibility for Medicaid to address
 
01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
some of their long-term care needs while
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
they're waiting
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I hope that that answers your
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
question so if if we are able to fill
 
01:58:55.070 --> 01:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
more beds because we're giving more
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
money for the nursing homes than likely
 
01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
CFI may see a little reduction initially
 
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
as these people go and fill bits is that
 
01:59:08.450 --> 01:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
likely to to Mr White if you want to
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
speak why don't you just sit at the end
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
here to your left
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I I just wanted to um provide we were
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
asked for just for some historical
 
01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:24.589 align:start position:0%
asked for just for some historical
projections

01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
projections
 
01:59:26.570 --> 01:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and the team went back and looked at
 
01:59:28.850 --> 01:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
this last night and this morning and so
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
basically on the CFI utilization side we
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
saw 14 increase from 21 to 22 and we're
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
currently projecting a five percent
 
01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
increase for State fiscal uh State
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 over 22.
 
01:59:45.169 --> 01:59:45.179 align:start position:0%
um so so this question had come up in
 
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
the context of the 15.1 million dollar
 
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh uh the 15.1 million dollars to be
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
used for CFI and whether we could
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
utilize any of that for rate increases
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
and based on what we're seeing now we we
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
would not recommend that because we do
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
based on the past couple of years we are
 
02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
seeing higher levels of utilization at
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
the end of the day CFI is an inherently
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
a cheaper option than than the nursing
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
home route so so I I just wanted to give
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
you that information based on that
 
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:23.209 --> 02:00:23.219 align:start position:0%
the other question I had was I remember
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:25.430 align:start position:0%
years ago
um

02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
one local lady was having trouble
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
getting some of her weekly chores done
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
and she applied for money and they said
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
well we don't have anybody now that can
 
02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
do that she went and recruited a
 
02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
neighbor that would put in six hours a
 
02:00:44.089 --> 02:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
week like doing her laundry in her her
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
ironing and so on and
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
was able to pay the neighbor and it made
 
02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
her a lot more comfortable not having a
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
stranger come in is that still possible
 
02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
or would that neighbor have to go
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
through all sorts of Licensing and all
 
02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
that stuff
 
02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:01:02.219 --> 02:01:03.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
individuals who are getting home and
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
community-based services through CFI can
 
02:01:11.209 --> 02:01:11.219 align:start position:0%
choose to have somebody they know be
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
paid to provide the care they don't have
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
to be licensed as a as a person to be
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
what you're describing as homemaking
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
services and helping with those chores
 
02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
but they do have to be employed by one
 
02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
of our enrolled providers so they would
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
they would be employed with an agency
 
02:01:36.370 --> 02:01:36.380 align:start position:0%
such as you know a centria or you know
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
Easter Seals or and they would um
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
receive their their paycheck through
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
that enrolled provider
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to be personally
 
02:01:49.129 --> 02:01:49.139 align:start position:0%
licensed to be able to do that
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
would that be much of a task to get
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
signed up with say Easter Seals if a
 
02:01:56.209 --> 02:01:56.219 align:start position:0%
person wants a trusted neighbor to come
 
02:01:58.129 --> 02:01:58.139 align:start position:0%
in and help them
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
um if that neighbor would agree to being
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
02:02:05.089 --> 02:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that that is a rigorous
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
process it happens all the time we have
 
02:02:10.609 --> 02:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
many people who choose to have a family
 
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
member or a neighbor or somebody they
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
know be enrolled and employed to provide
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
those services so
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
um uh I've I've asked the question over
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
time and you know typically you know
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the individual and the kind of
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
service it it can take you know a couple
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
of weeks to get enrolled thank you
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
do you have further questions sir okay
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
so so thank you go ahead representative
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
ask uh Mr White a clarifying question
 
02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:46.729 align:start position:0%
ask uh Mr White a clarifying question
sure

02:02:46.729 --> 02:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:02:46.739 --> 02:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
sure
yeah

02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
just so so I'd put it in my words but I
 
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:51.300 align:start position:0%
think you said
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
over the next biennium you expect to
 
02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
have the Staffing available to to take
 
02:02:59.689 --> 02:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
care of all of these 15 million dollars
 
02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
is that is that accurate
 
02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
so so can I back up and go because
 
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
you're touching on a task that we asked
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
Mr White to look at over the week
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
overnight and then that task was uh 234
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
was just an increased utilization number
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
and we talked a lot about well if we
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't increase the rate we're probably
 
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
not going to expect a lot of utilization
 
02:03:26.209 --> 02:03:26.219 align:start position:0%
and so we asked Mr White and his team to
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
come back with two numbers
 
02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
two sets of numbers the utilization
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
number and the rate number to where they
 
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
can try to balance the two to get what
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
we really think is going to happen so so
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
you've asked a good question but it's
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's really two we're asking you for the
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
result of your analysis
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
sure and and so what I provided earlier
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
was the fact that we are seeing an
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
upward Trend in this area
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and I had said yesterday whether I I
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
would give an opinion on whether we
 
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
could utilize some of that or not for
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
for rate increases I I mean based on
 
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing I I think I I
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
personally just sitting on on the dollar
 
02:04:12.649 --> 02:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
side of things that that we have to
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
manage throughout the year I I would be
 
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
a little nervous about making reductions
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I believe we spoke about this
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday but the the 15 million if you
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
took the whole 15 million and put it
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
towards CFI rate increase it would be
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
something like four percent so if you
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
were to take a portion of that say seven
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know you could think two percent
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
increase for CFI rate increase or if you
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
took 75 percent think three you know one
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
percent or what whatever it may be but
 
02:04:38.639 --> 02:04:40.070 align:start position:0%
percent or what whatever it may be but
but

02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to the workforce issue
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
I would kind of look towards towards
 
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
Wendy and and Melissa uh to speak to
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
what their seeing on the ground is
 
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
they're a lot more informed about that
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
than myself so so that's not the answer
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
I was expecting and and maybe maybe I
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
didn't ask the the ask it right but I'm
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'm I was looking for two sets of
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
numbers from you one is are the numbers
 
02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:06.659 align:start position:0%
on 234 if that's meant to capture only
 
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
the utilization
 
02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
and we went over to the Moynihan
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
document to look at the numbers on it as
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
the rate increase contribution
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get from the
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
Department your best sort of
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
professional Judgment of whether this
 
02:05:28.250 --> 02:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
these utilization numbers will feed
 
02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
utilization if we do these CFI numbers
 
02:05:35.089 --> 02:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
which is 7.6 in the first year 9.3 this
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
second for 16.9 if we if we invest 16.9
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
and more rates is that going to
 
02:05:48.410 --> 02:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
make sure that this the the the the 234
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
numbers are end up fully committed sure
 
02:05:53.570 --> 02:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
I I think you're looking for a calculus
 
02:05:56.089 --> 02:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
level answer and and I don't have my t89
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
here but
 
02:06:00.410 --> 02:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is we are seeing
 
02:06:03.169 --> 02:06:03.179 align:start position:0%
increased utilization and you know if if
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
it is you know the purview of the
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee to to take a component of that
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
and apply that to rates um I think
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
there's just a certain level of risk
 
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
there but but these figures were based
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
off of what we're seeing for our
 
02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
maintenance and our projected needs so
 
02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
that those increases that we're talking
 
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:24.229 align:start position:0%
that those increases that we're talking
about

02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
can I take a stab at it so everything
 
02:06:28.129 --> 02:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
you've said makes perfect sense and I
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
think you said it like two or three
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
times now but I'm really just asking a
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
very simple question do you feel you
 
02:06:36.649 --> 02:06:36.659 align:start position:0%
have this you will have the Staffing the
 
02:06:39.010 --> 02:06:39.020 align:start position:0%
people to do that provide the services
 
02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
to use up the funds
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm not asking you to be 100
 
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
accurate I'm just asking what's your gut
 
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
I I I I would have to have Wendy and
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
Melissa speak to what they're seeing in
 
02:07:00.770 --> 02:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
the field because again I'm I'm not
 
02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
involved with the provider community on
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
a day-to-day basis I think their
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
perspective is really important to
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
consider here and I I realize I'm not
 
02:07:09.050 --> 02:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
answering your yes or no question and I
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
um uh based on what I'm seeing the
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
answer diplomatically would be perhaps
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
it might
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
um what we hear from our agencies and
 
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
the struggles that they have with their
 
02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:32.780 align:start position:0%
Workforce in their agencies
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of their needs and their talking
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
points are related to what they need to
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
be able to recruit
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
additional staff to meet the additional
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
need and I think ultimately
 
02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:48.350 align:start position:0%
need and I think ultimately
um

02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
what we can maintain in our budget may
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
not get us to a place where they are in
 
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
a position where they can recruit more
 
02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:56.990 align:start position:0%
a position where they can recruit more
staff

02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
um what they are talking about in these
 
02:08:01.790 --> 02:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
increases that have been requested as
 
02:08:04.370 --> 02:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
part of our prioritized need
 
02:08:06.649 --> 02:08:06.659 align:start position:0%
um and in some of those other bills that
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
have been introduced
 
02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I think will get them to a place
 
02:08:15.649 --> 02:08:15.659 align:start position:0%
where they may be able to recruit and
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
retain the staff to meet
 
02:08:21.410 --> 02:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
um the demand or the the upward Trend
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing in enrollment
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I get that you're seeing
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
a need
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
and here's what we're struggling with
 
02:08:32.689 --> 02:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
we hear that rates are too low to
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
attract people and if you don't spend
 
02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
the money it basically it's like we put
 
02:08:38.930 --> 02:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
it into a bank and it's still sitting
 
02:08:40.729 --> 02:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
there at the end of 25.
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out is there a
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
way to get some so that might just wind
 
02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
up in the bank we don't really want
 
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
money in the bank at the end of 25. we
 
02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:49.139 align:start position:0%
either take that money now at the
 
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
general funds portion of it and put it
 
02:08:53.089 --> 02:08:53.099 align:start position:0%
into addressing rates across the board
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
so whether it's impacting CFI which
 
02:08:56.450 --> 02:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
obviously is a good I mean I agree
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great goal because
 
02:09:00.070 --> 02:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's the lowest cost absolutely for sure
 
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:02.099 align:start position:0%
but if you're not going to spend that
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
money be just it'd be wiser to put that
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
money to other areas where perhaps
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
there is the potential to more fully
 
02:09:11.450 --> 02:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
utilize their services does that make
 
02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:15.890 align:start position:0%
utilize their services does that make
sense

02:09:15.890 --> 02:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.890 --> 02:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
that was also yes or no question
 
02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but I'm also
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
um thinking about
 
02:09:23.159 --> 02:09:23.810 align:start position:0%
um thinking about
um

02:09:23.810 --> 02:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
what Nathan
 
02:09:28.250 --> 02:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
um provided for information in terms of
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
we we need to balance that and be
 
02:09:32.770 --> 02:09:32.780 align:start position:0%
conservative in terms of making sure our
 
02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
prioritize needs Baseline
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
um it can be there in order to maintain
 
02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
what we see as an upward Trend in
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
addition to what is being asked for for
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
rate increases okay so Sansa you're
 
02:09:47.689 --> 02:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
saying no
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
so representative erf would you change
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
the numbers in 234 yes or no
 
02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
I guess not based on what we're hearing
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay so uh I would like to go ahead and
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
have us uh vote on uh 234. uh is there
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
any opposition to leaving 234 as is
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any okay so if you I
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
would just say I you know I think we
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
could you know especially since the part
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
of the rate increases we might be able
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
we might be able to reduce those numbers
 
02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:20.209 align:start position:0%
we might be able to reduce those numbers
uh

02:10:20.209 --> 02:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
um somewhat say what is your proposal uh
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:28.729 --> 02:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
um especially if they're part of the
 
02:10:32.209 --> 02:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
rate increases as well so I I intend I
 
02:10:33.649 --> 02:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
intended to keep these two things
 
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
distinct just you know the the this is
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
just meant to be more utilization while
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the rate increases are more
 
02:10:43.729 --> 02:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
I understand and and Mr White was right
 
02:10:45.410 --> 02:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's calculus I don't know how to do
 
02:10:46.729 --> 02:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
that that's why I asked the department
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
to do it uh
 
02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Waller
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
I just I just wondered in a case like
 
02:10:53.639 --> 02:10:54.950 align:start position:0%
I just I just wondered in a case like
this

02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I understand the idea of you know
 
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
Indy getting to the end of the biennium
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
and finding out we didn't spin down when
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
we could have used that for for rate
 
02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:06.050 align:start position:0%
we could have used that for for rate
increase

02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:07.189 align:start position:0%
increase
um

02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if we could and I
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
think we did this with another service
 
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember which one it was
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
right off the top of my head but
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
a statement that
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
if they begin to
 
02:11:26.209 --> 02:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
draw down more than is appropriated that
 
02:11:28.609 --> 02:11:28.619 align:start position:0%
they could come to fiscal
 
02:11:28.619 --> 02:11:29.950 align:start position:0%
they could come to fiscal
for

02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
additional additional funds
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
um I think we did it for some other
 
02:11:37.729 --> 02:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
service and I can't remember which one
 
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
it was we had a statement like that it
 
02:11:41.450 --> 02:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
was the DD services
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay so we have to decide on 234 today
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh and and right now the only issue that
 
02:11:51.609 --> 02:11:51.619 align:start position:0%
I see is the dollar amount
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'd want to keep the language
 
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
well it is a dollar
 
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
it is a dollar issue but it's also if we
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
take the money and then they find
 
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
themselves in a situation
 
02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:07.490 align:start position:0%
themselves in a situation
where

02:12:07.490 --> 02:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:12:10.729 --> 02:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
a year from now or a year and a half two
 
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
years from now they're they're drawing
 
02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
down because utilization was higher it
 
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
seems like we could do something
 
02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
in the but we could do something to give
 
02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
them at least
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
some options for
 
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
um making sure they don't run out of
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
funds in that line so you have an
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to 234 you want to propose
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
well I don't have it with me I don't
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
have it right now but you have it in
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
your head that you could yeah I can talk
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
to Kevin about it because because we
 
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
have to vote on this today we have to be
 
02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
this has to be in the rearview mirror
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay great I'm just trying to make it so
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
that people feel a little more a little
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
bit of comfort and if that if those
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
funds are taken for real we've already
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
built some flexibility into how we're
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
going to draft the Stringham structure
 
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
by having some some money able to be
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
moved around in the between the
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
bienniums depending on the readiness
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't that give you the
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
because I just want to vote on 234 now I
 
02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
do uh let uh I'm ready for a straw vote
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
I I I I I hear a proposal to reduce the
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
amounts I hear a proposal to keep the
 
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
amounts the same
 
02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
I think CFI is probably one of the
 
02:13:35.149 --> 02:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
smartest things we spend money on I I I
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
would I would like to get a straw vote
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
on keeping 234 as is and the dollar
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
amounts the same
 
02:13:47.569 --> 02:13:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay opposed okay all right very good so
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
234 is off the table I think
 
02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:56.209 align:start position:0%
234 is off the table I think
um

02:13:56.209 --> 02:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
do you want while we have the CFI folks
 
02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
here do you have any specific questions
 
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
like representative Stringham or Earth
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
about their Contra their elements of the
 
02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
Monahan document
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
because CFI is listed as its own line
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
item for 9 16.9 for rate increases
 
02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
um can you just comment on whether the
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
rate increases you requested
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
um you still feel that you kind of need
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
that full appropriation given that 234
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
has been uh kept in the budget as
 
02:14:38.410 --> 02:14:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
so so just to clarify so 234 covers the
 
02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
service levels the rate increase would
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
be completely separate from that so I'm
 
02:14:51.850 --> 02:14:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day there it's going
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
to be merged numbers yes for the
 
02:15:00.410 --> 02:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
purposes of being able to talk about it
 
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
and see the interaction between these
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
two variables we're keeping them
 
02:15:07.129 --> 02:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
separate that way we can explain what we
 
02:15:09.530 --> 02:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
did to the Senate and why we did it so
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be the utilization
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
number and we still have to deal with
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
the rate numbers okay I think the
 
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
question is still a fair one knowing
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
that at some point these numbers are all
 
02:15:23.089 --> 02:15:23.099 align:start position:0%
going to merge and we're not no longer
 
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
going to be able to distinguish between
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
utilization and rates I think the
 
02:15:31.550 --> 02:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
question is given that we're on a on a
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
trajectory of providing 16.9 million or
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
thereabouts or some factor of that is a
 
02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
rate increase
 
02:15:45.169 --> 02:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
is that as as critical given that we've
 
02:15:47.050 --> 02:15:47.060 align:start position:0%
we're trying to lock in
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
234 rates
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
is that did I get your question right
 
02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes that's right and and some of the
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
previous conversations I had I I felt
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
like there was a little bit of
 
02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:01.669 align:start position:0%
like there was a little bit of
flexibility

02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
um uh given that there were two separate
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
buckets and that uh there might be a
 
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
little more wiggle room here
 
02:16:11.810 --> 02:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
so do you want to comment on that should
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
we look for Mr Moynihan again
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
so I I didn't prepare that document so I
 
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
I can't necessarily if if you're gonna
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about like the
 
02:16:23.089 --> 02:16:23.099 align:start position:0%
origin of the rates that are in there I
 
02:16:26.089 --> 02:16:26.099 align:start position:0%
would have to defer to Mr Monahan is is
 
02:16:28.370 --> 02:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
Monahan is he around oh there he is I
 
02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
couldn't see him behind Alex
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
's beard got so big I couldn't see
 
02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
and Miss phillipman you're welcome to
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
jump in on this at any point you you
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
know when you need to say something to
 
02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:43.490 align:start position:0%
know when you need to say something to
us

02:16:43.490 --> 02:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
so okay so Mr Monahan you you followed
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
the conversation I imagine
 
02:16:53.570 --> 02:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
we've just locked in the the monies in
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
234 which is I don't know about 15
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
increase for CFI
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
you've given you've coordinated with the
 
02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
community and you have another 16.9 that
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
you did in the rate increase do you
 
02:17:09.650 --> 02:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
still do you think based on the
 
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
methodology and conversations you had
 
02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
that that this 16.9 is still the right
 
02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
number given that we just provided 15
 
02:17:22.490 --> 02:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
million for utilization
 
02:17:25.610 --> 02:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh yes so as the spreadsheet indicates
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
its rates my take was the same as yours
 
02:17:31.129 --> 02:17:31.139 align:start position:0%
that the section in House Bill 2 dealt
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
with utilization
 
02:17:33.889 --> 02:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
um but I do think they have to work
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
together you know you can't utilization
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
won't grow if you don't have the
 
02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
workforce so that's so I heard a yes I
 
02:17:43.009 --> 02:17:43.019 align:start position:0%
want to thank you you're the first
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
person to answer a yes or no question in
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
weeks so thank you
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
so representative Stringham do you did
 
02:17:53.330 --> 02:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
you you okay with what you just heard
 
02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
yep no Mr lippman what do you want to
 
02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
say to us I was that for a yes or no
 
02:17:57.059 --> 02:17:58.250 align:start position:0%
say to us I was that for a yes or no
answer

02:17:58.250 --> 02:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
can I say yes to start
 
02:18:00.479 --> 02:18:03.169 align:start position:0%
can I say yes to start
um

02:18:03.169 --> 02:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
I agree with uh Simone about it because
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
CFI from a rate setting purpose is one
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
area where it gets adversely selected
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
against because
 
02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
um based on historical rate changes CFI
 
02:18:20.089 --> 02:18:20.099 align:start position:0%
often finds itself for the same service
 
02:18:21.770 --> 02:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
at a different rate and I think the
 
02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
legislatures have talked about trying to
 
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
achieve parity and that's why I think
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
the money that's here is important to to
 
02:18:31.389 --> 02:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
so representative I'm going to just make
 
02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
sure I touch base with you before we
 
02:18:37.969 --> 02:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
come off this conversation just you
 
02:18:40.370 --> 02:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
gotta all the data you need you're still
 
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
comfortable with all your analysis for
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
them for the Medicaid rate increases yes
 
02:18:45.359 --> 02:18:46.549 align:start position:0%
them for the Medicaid rate increases yes
okay

02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
all right so so so we're still working
 
02:18:52.250 --> 02:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
on that but thank you so much
 
02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:54.469 align:start position:0%
on that but thank you so much
um

02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:00.009 --> 02:19:00.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
wasn't this you carry forward on the DD
 
02:19:02.939 --> 02:19:04.549 align:start position:0%
wasn't this you carry forward on the DD
services

02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
because because we haven't actually
 
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
taken that off of a hold status
 
02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:10.910 align:start position:0%
taken that off of a hold status
right

02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:12.230 align:start position:0%
right
um

02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
so there's two parts to this and I'll
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
just do it from my head since uh camera
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
kind of caught me off guard
 
02:19:22.490 --> 02:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
so this is the there's three pieces of
 
02:19:24.410 --> 02:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
this in HP one and then there's this
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
piece in hp2 this is the funding we
 
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
talked about yesterday from three
 
02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:31.139 align:start position:0%
accounts it's three DD accounts that is
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
essentially what would lapse this fiscal
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
23 but wouldn't lapse because it's
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated forward and in
 
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
one of the accounts we would take 25
 
02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:43.490 align:start position:0%
one of the accounts we would take 25
million

02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
and transfer to that account
 
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
agency income in 24.
 
02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
and in that same account General funds
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
reduced by 25 million
 
02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
same thing with another account we do
 
02:19:59.570 --> 02:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
nine hundred thousand dollars same game
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
and then the third account we would take
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
2.7 million dollars if I'm not mistaken
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
and do the same thing which would result
 
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
in freeing up 28.4 million dollars in
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
general funds and that again goes to my
 
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
thing I've been saying all along that
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be put in that that's
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
another piece of this of the of the of
 
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
the total that we wind up putting in at
 
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
that Top Line where the 40 million is
 
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
right now does that make are there any
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:35.889 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:20:35.889 --> 02:20:35.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
go ahead and keep driving to a yes or no
 
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm 232. okay so I would propose that
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
we oh I don't have the numbers and hang
 
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
on a second
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it's amendment number one
 
02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.330 --> 02:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
it is yes and if anybody doesn't have a
 
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then there are also three related
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.490 --> 02:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we're doing this by
 
02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
motions or whatever but I would I would
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
suggest that we
 
02:21:20.939 --> 02:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
suggest that we
did

02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
the package deal I would suggest that we
 
02:21:29.090 --> 02:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
accept those three hb1 amendments and
 
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
the hp2 amendment number
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:52.330 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:21:52.330 --> 02:21:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative stream I
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
just everything I've heard yesterday and
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know without
 
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and continuing to search on it this
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
looks like a a good way to uh better
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
manage our state's resources still fully
 
02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
fund and fully support uh the
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled community and
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
the other programs covered in here I
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
plan to vote in favor of this amendment
 
02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
and the other three related amendments
 
02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:29.050 align:start position:0%
and the other three related amendments
foreign

02:22:29.050 --> 02:22:29.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
I got distracted you weren't asking me a
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
question probably did you did you have a
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
question for you you or did you just
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
make an observation I mean this is a
 
02:22:40.330 --> 02:22:40.340 align:start position:0%
good approach
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Waller
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
so we have let's just vote this as a
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
package the three spreadsheets that we
 
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
saw yesterday that if you add them up
 
02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
they're 28.6 million that we're taking
 
02:23:07.370 --> 02:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh to fully fund the DD they're going to
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
still be fully uh supported that wait
 
02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
list we're going to take that money put
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
it into the next biennium and
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and and have that money available and
 
02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
then what does what does one six one one
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
zero one six four do again
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
I just looked at it
 
02:23:30.050 --> 02:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
that does the work that does the work of
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
all right is there any opposition
 
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
so uh those in favor of except accepting
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
one zero six four raise your hand
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay opposed no one good so so
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh let's go down to 250 what sorry if I
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
could so am I correct that in voting on
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
that as a package you also approved the
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
three house build one changes as well
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
um okay so down to 254 Family Resource
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
Center infrastructure
 
02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
we have we put this on hold
 
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh who who who was who was opposed to
 
02:24:29.090 --> 02:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
254 that would like to speak for just a
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.170 align:start position:0%
sure
um

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
a lot of parts are moving so we may have
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
made up the the Gap so far that
 
02:24:46.250 --> 02:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
um in terms of total funding but last
 
02:24:47.929 --> 02:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
time I looked we were still trying to
 
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
find enough money to to cover some of
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
the costs that are being concurrently
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
voted on in the various divisions so
 
02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
this was one that I was willing to take
 
02:24:58.849 --> 02:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
out to try and find two million dollars
 
02:25:02.929 --> 02:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.090 --> 02:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
so if we were to eliminate this you're
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
saying we'd have a million dollars a
 
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
year that we could add over to the
 
02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate exercise correct
 
02:25:14.210 --> 02:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion around that
 
02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
proposal any opposition to what
 
02:25:22.730 --> 02:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:24.889 --> 02:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote no
 
02:25:24.899 --> 02:25:26.809 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote no
um

02:25:26.809 --> 02:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:30.170 --> 02:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
I think it's a very much used program
 
02:25:34.610 --> 02:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
and needed and it's it's really primary
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay so the so the proposal on 254 is if
 
02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of of deleting it or
 
02:25:53.210 --> 02:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of keeping it it's
 
02:26:00.610 --> 02:26:00.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
now my my intent is for that money to be
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
relocated to the Medicaid rate increase
 
02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
I I and and as important as this is I'm
 
02:26:14.410 --> 02:26:14.420 align:start position:0%
I'm I just have this tendency to think
 
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
investing in direct Health Care
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
is better than trying to manage social
 
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
emotional issues in the society at large
 
02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
and that it's not particularly the
 
02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
state's business
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
to to be that worried that involved in
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
society but so I I'm comfortable with
 
02:26:38.270 --> 02:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
that decision did you have a comment
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
my comment is I would disagree with you
 
02:26:45.469 --> 02:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
that was yeah I'm all for prevention
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
um attacking Aces
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
um you know getting to families before
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
we have them in crisis before we have
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
children abused before we have children
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
in the system before we have children
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
moving into the sununa youth center but
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
we we disagree on that that's okay I I
 
02:27:01.610 --> 02:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
agree with everything you just said the
 
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
distinction between your point of view
 
02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
and mine is just simply can the
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
government resource and fund our way to
 
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
that objective
 
02:27:14.330 --> 02:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so we've been trying
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know so all right so we just
 
02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
disagree on the effectiveness of money
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
in that situation but
 
02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we've hit
 
02:27:31.370 --> 02:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
we've hit all of the items on the on
 
02:27:33.770 --> 02:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
that sheet and then we have some hb2
 
02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
amendments on the second page that we've
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:42.410 --> 02:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
um there is there are two amendments
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
related to the prescription drug
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
affordability board uh representative
 
02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
leishman I'd like him to be able to come
 
02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
in and talk about that and then there's
 
02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
some discussion that representative
 
02:27:59.630 --> 02:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
Merchant armor Shaw might want to show
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
up so
 
02:28:05.050 --> 02:28:05.060 align:start position:0%
um so why don't we talk about Amendment
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
zero nine four seven I don't think we've
 
02:28:10.849 --> 02:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
actually voted on this except I it felt
 
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
like we had a consensus that we want to
 
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that the alcohol and drug
 
02:28:21.170 --> 02:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
abuse commission has
 
02:28:24.410 --> 02:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
a clear shot at keeping all five percent
 
02:28:28.429 --> 02:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
for their programs Mr chair zero nine
 
02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
seven four eight hotel I think I think
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
you transpose two numbers
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
did I I'm talking zero nine
 
02:28:41.270 --> 02:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
seven four yes yes I untransposed them
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
just before seven that's okay yeah yeah
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay so do you do you have those
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna let uh
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney lead this
 
02:28:56.929 --> 02:28:56.939 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm going to go check on
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative leishman's status uh my
 
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
position is uh this is essential because
 
02:29:08.090 --> 02:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
earlier we eliminated a couple of
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
State directed expenditures of that
 
02:29:14.349 --> 02:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug commission money and
 
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
and backfilled it with General funds I
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
want to keep this out of the general
 
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman I just want
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
to be sure we all have the it's been a
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
while since this came up it actually did
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
not come up yesterday so we have in
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
front of us like you say Amendment
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
0974h and then there was a
 
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
I thought I
 
02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
supplemental document to that was there
 
02:29:44.819 --> 02:29:46.370 align:start position:0%
supplemental document to that was there
not

02:29:46.370 --> 02:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
right ah here it is yes hb1
 
02:29:53.570 --> 02:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
looks like that I know they all do and
 
02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
and then there was an additional
 
02:29:57.889 --> 02:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
document that looked like that it was
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
about a third of the page
 
02:30:03.790 --> 02:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
in length so we're looking at three
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
documents that were given out along with
 
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
yes the um the third of the page says
 
02:30:15.469 --> 02:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
proposed budget changes impacting the
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission when alcohol and
 
02:30:19.969 --> 02:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
drug abuse prevention treatment and
 
02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
Recovery prepared for representative
 
02:30:22.439 --> 02:30:24.050 align:start position:0%
Recovery prepared for representative
Edwards

02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
and then again the hb1 amendment and
 
02:30:27.300 --> 02:30:29.290 align:start position:0%
and then again the hb1 amendment and
then

02:30:29.290 --> 02:30:29.300 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
0974h so we're looking at all three and
 
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
then I would ask I see Mr Ripple sending
 
02:30:37.309 --> 02:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
Distributing those again for those who
 
02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
may not have them perhaps take us
 
02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
through those documents again Mr Ripple
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
if you could just to refresh our
 
02:30:43.439 --> 02:30:44.450 align:start position:0%
if you could just to refresh our
memories

02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
memories
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
before we head to vote
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:20.690 --> 02:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
okay so starting with the amendment
 
02:31:24.969 --> 02:31:24.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
the sole purpose of all of this is to
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that the alcohol fund
 
02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
receives five percent of gross liquor
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
profits and does not have to transfer
 
02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
them to the granted Advantage Program
 
02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:40.910 align:start position:0%
them to the granted Advantage Program
so

02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:44.030 --> 02:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
sections one
 
02:31:45.650 --> 02:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
and five
 
02:31:48.410 --> 02:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
either amend or repeal the existing
 
02:31:50.690 --> 02:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
statutory references to the transfer of
 
02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
those funds from the alcohol fund to
 
02:31:56.270 --> 02:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:58.969 --> 02:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
section two
 
02:32:02.090 --> 02:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
states that for fiscal 24 any such
 
02:32:04.490 --> 02:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
transfer shall be reduced by the amount
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
of federal or other funds used by HHS to
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
fund the programs approved by the
 
02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission in practice that
 
02:32:12.730 --> 02:32:12.740 align:start position:0%
refers to the 5 million dollar
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
contribution from hospitals that will
 
02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
take place at the end of this calendar
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
year so rather than getting
 
02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
11 million dollars in liquor funds plus
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
5 million from the hospitals the alcohol
 
02:32:26.690 --> 02:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
fund and the governor's commission would
 
02:32:31.450 --> 02:32:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:34.849 --> 02:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
sections three
 
02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
and four
 
02:32:36.899 --> 02:32:39.950 align:start position:0%
and four
are

02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
changes to statutes that are related to
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage Program so by
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
removing the alcohol fund as a source of
 
02:32:51.290 --> 02:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
revenue for a granted advantage that
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
changes the calculus related to how
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
other parts of Grant Advantage are
 
02:32:56.929 --> 02:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
funded and I don't want to get too far
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
into the weeds with that but these two
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
sections would only change
 
02:33:03.410 --> 02:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
these two sections would only be
 
02:33:06.650 --> 02:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
effective if the grand Advantage Program
 
02:33:10.250 --> 02:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
is reauthorized and so you can see that
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
so the upshot of all of this is to
 
02:33:23.150 --> 02:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that going forward the alcohol
 
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
fund receives an amount equal to five
 
02:33:31.250 --> 02:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and these are new sections to
 
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill too correct just so
 
02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
everybody's we're all staying together
 
02:33:40.130 --> 02:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
or just just a comment
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
I guess I feel really uncomfortable
 
02:33:48.479 --> 02:33:50.090 align:start position:0%
I guess I feel really uncomfortable
about

02:33:50.090 --> 02:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:33:51.770 --> 02:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
um the whole area around the granted
 
02:33:54.050 --> 02:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
Advantage we haven't even seen we
 
02:33:57.050 --> 02:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
haven't even seen the uh bill yet
 
02:33:58.849 --> 02:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
it hasn't come over here
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
and until
 
02:34:03.530 --> 02:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
I have a better handle on that I don't
 
02:34:05.690 --> 02:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable changing the funding
 
02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:06.710 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable changing the funding
sources

02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
sources
 
02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
what can you share with us
 
02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:11.929 align:start position:0%
what can you share with us
foreign

02:34:11.929 --> 02:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
all I would say is that this language is
 
02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
included verbatim in Senate Bill 263 as
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate that reauthorizes
 
02:34:21.650 --> 02:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage the only difference
 
02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage the only difference
being

02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
section 2 the provision that reduces the
 
02:34:29.929 --> 02:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
liquor prop the transfer of liquor
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
profits by the amount of the five
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
million dollar donation and the
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
contingency language on page 2 lines 14
 
02:34:39.050 --> 02:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
through 16 that in this amendment States
 
02:34:40.610 --> 02:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
those sections will only go into effect
 
02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
if granted Advantage is reauthorized
 
02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
obviously that language is not needed in
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:35:00.110 --> 02:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
I I would like to go ahead and have us
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
vote on zero nine seven four
 
02:35:10.849 --> 02:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.809 --> 02:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.210 --> 02:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay so so we'll accept this and just
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
put a new section number together
 
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:29.450 align:start position:0%
put a new section number together
mm-hmm

02:35:29.450 --> 02:35:29.460 align:start position:0%

okay uh we're we're back in our work
 
03:16:16.910 --> 03:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
session uh we're we have to take a pause
 
03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
at two o'clock we have three amendments
 
03:16:20.399 --> 03:16:21.050 align:start position:0%
at two o'clock we have three amendments
um

03:16:21.050 --> 03:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:24.230 --> 03:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
by representative walner would you
 
03:16:37.750 --> 03:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
statute I just if you can access it
 
03:16:41.640 --> 03:16:44.269 align:start position:0%
statute I just if you can access it
quickly

03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:23.330 --> 03:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:33.479 --> 03:17:55.210 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

03:17:55.210 --> 03:17:55.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.050 --> 03:18:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:05.150 --> 03:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
so I think we all have a copy now do you
 
03:18:07.130 --> 03:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
want to just start sure
 
03:18:11.769 --> 03:18:11.779 align:start position:0%
so um the first one that you have is
 
03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
about the reimbursement rate paid for
 
03:18:17.690 --> 03:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
child care per paid to child care
 
03:18:21.889 --> 03:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
providers for providing services to low
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
and moderate income Working Families
 
03:18:27.650 --> 03:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
so in the budget we didn't spend a lot
 
03:18:29.690 --> 03:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
of time on the child care
 
03:18:32.570 --> 03:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
area which I was sort of sorry that we
 
03:18:34.849 --> 03:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
didn't at the time
 
03:18:34.859 --> 03:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
didn't at the time
um

03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:38.210 --> 03:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
it seems like we there was a lot there
 
03:18:40.849 --> 03:18:40.859 align:start position:0%
was a lot to do that day so
 
03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so child care has hasn't really had a
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
lot of attention during this budget
 
03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:49.090 align:start position:0%
lot of attention during this budget
session

03:18:49.090 --> 03:18:49.100 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
so what this would do real quick
 
03:18:56.150 --> 03:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
um which section in hb2 are we does this
 
03:18:57.410 --> 03:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
tie back to
 
03:19:00.230 --> 03:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is a new this would be new
 
03:19:03.230 --> 03:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
this would be a new hb2 okay
 
03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:04.670 align:start position:0%
this would be a new hb2 okay
so

03:19:04.670 --> 03:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
what this does there was no rate
 
03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
increase for child care
 
03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the budget prep budget
 
03:19:13.969 --> 03:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
um that we had before us
 
03:19:16.429 --> 03:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that was
 
03:19:19.010 --> 03:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
that at least the reason I have been
 
03:19:22.610 --> 03:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
told was that and I know this to be true
 
03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:23.570 align:start position:0%
told was that and I know this to be true
that

03:19:23.570 --> 03:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
Child Care rates are set with a market
 
03:19:29.690 --> 03:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
rate survey
 
03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they do the market rate survey every
 
03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
two years
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
and in the last several bienniums the
 
03:19:40.190 --> 03:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
market rate survey was done
 
03:19:42.170 --> 03:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
and then when we would come to the
 
03:19:42.180 --> 03:19:43.070 align:start position:0%
and then when we would come to the
budget

03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:19:45.710 --> 03:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
they would have the information they
 
03:19:47.570 --> 03:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
needed to set the rate
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
well in these past two years there was
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
no market rate survey done
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're hoping to do one
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the coming year
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
but there's no market rate survey done
 
03:20:03.769 --> 03:20:03.779 align:start position:0%
so there was no information for rate
 
03:20:03.779 --> 03:20:05.630 align:start position:0%
so there was no information for rate
setting

03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
setting
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
what this would do
 
03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
is use
 
03:20:12.590 --> 03:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
the the market rate survey from two
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:20:16.969 --> 03:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
to set the rate at the 75th percentile
 
03:20:19.370 --> 03:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
of the market rate
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
meaning that
 
03:20:25.730 --> 03:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
25 of the providers would be charging
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
more than than the 75th percentile and
 
03:20:31.090 --> 03:20:31.100 align:start position:0%
75 percent would be charging less
 
03:20:34.490 --> 03:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
providers get paid either the 70 at the
 
03:20:36.230 --> 03:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
75th percentile
 
03:20:40.849 --> 03:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
or their actual charge whichever is less
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that that
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
they get whichever is less so if the
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
market rate at 75th is 200 a week
 
03:20:53.330 --> 03:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
then that's what the provider would get
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
if their rate was at least two hundred
 
03:20:57.710 --> 03:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
dollars a week or more
 
03:21:00.290 --> 03:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
if it was less they would get the lesser
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
amount say they only charged 150 they
 
03:21:06.889 --> 03:21:06.899 align:start position:0%
would get 150. so they only they get the
 
03:21:10.010 --> 03:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
lesser of the two but in order to give
 
03:21:10.020 --> 03:21:11.210 align:start position:0%
lesser of the two but in order to give
them

03:21:11.210 --> 03:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:21:11.220 --> 03:21:13.550 align:start position:0%
them
a

03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:21:13.560 --> 03:21:15.650 align:start position:0%
a
reimbursement

03:21:15.650 --> 03:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
03:21:15.660 --> 03:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
rate

03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:21:21.410 --> 03:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
increase during the next biennium this
 
03:21:24.290 --> 03:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
is um the way we would we have available
 
03:21:27.530 --> 03:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
to do it at this point
 
03:21:29.389 --> 03:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
03:21:32.210 --> 03:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
I think the Senate has a bill
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
that has some of the same Provisions in
 
03:21:35.040 --> 03:21:36.110 align:start position:0%
that has some of the same Provisions in
it

03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:37.849 align:start position:0%
it
so

03:21:37.849 --> 03:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:40.370 --> 03:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
why'd I just open on this one for
 
03:21:42.590 --> 03:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Walnut oh let
 
03:21:44.570 --> 03:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
me let me just say one I the most
 
03:21:46.969 --> 03:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
important piece you don't have to worry
 
03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
about your general funds
 
03:21:50.750 --> 03:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
because there's something called the
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
TANF reserve and as
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
um Nathan has told us in the past
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's 67 million dollars in that
 
03:22:03.530 --> 03:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
and one of the uses for the TANF Reserve
 
03:22:07.370 --> 03:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
is child care there are four uses and I
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
can't remember what they all are but one
 
03:22:11.150 --> 03:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
of them is child care and we have not
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
been using
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
um our TANF money for child care we
 
03:22:18.650 --> 03:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
haven't had to in the last
 
03:22:18.660 --> 03:22:19.670 align:start position:0%
haven't had to in the last
um

03:22:19.670 --> 03:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:21.889 --> 03:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
a couple of a few bienniums so we
 
03:22:24.230 --> 03:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
haven't had to do it we did have a
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
provision in the last budget
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
that said if
 
03:22:31.969 --> 03:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
all the child care money the general
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
funds and the federal funds got drawn
 
03:22:33.960 --> 03:22:34.910 align:start position:0%
funds and the federal funds got drawn
down

03:22:34.910 --> 03:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:22:38.929 --> 03:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
then they could come to fiscal committee
 
03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
and ask to use TANF Reserve so that
 
03:22:44.690 --> 03:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a wait list
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have people have a job
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
an inner job and then you know and
 
03:22:55.370 --> 03:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
the end of the year in March of the
 
03:22:57.110 --> 03:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
second year the biennium find out that
 
03:23:00.230 --> 03:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
they're losing their child care so
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
we had that provision we did not have to
 
03:23:06.370 --> 03:23:06.380 align:start position:0%
use it so I have that provision here
 
03:23:09.050 --> 03:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
that if
 
03:23:11.929 --> 03:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
at the end of the if during the years
 
03:23:14.990 --> 03:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
the couple of years they draw down all
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
the money they can come to the fiscal
 
03:23:20.450 --> 03:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
committee and use TANF Reserve funds
 
03:23:22.969 --> 03:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
so of course question
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
yes I do several questions
 
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
do we have an any estimate on what how
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
much money we're talking about annually
 
03:23:33.050 --> 03:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
for this yes it would probably be I
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
think it's in the neighborhood of
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
they the department has done an estimate
 
03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:42.849 align:start position:0%
they the department has done an estimate
of

03:23:42.849 --> 03:23:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.130 --> 03:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
2.9 Million
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
but that's for the
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
um that's per year
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the child care budget I think is
 
03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:54.050 align:start position:0%
and the child care budget I think is
around

03:23:54.050 --> 03:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:23:57.170 --> 03:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
between Federal and
 
03:24:00.530 --> 03:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
General is it um
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
is it around 34 million
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
34 35 million
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it's this is a little bit less than
 
03:24:14.809 --> 03:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
okay you say like seven or eight percent
 
03:24:16.969 --> 03:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
increase and it would just be a one-time
 
03:24:20.809 --> 03:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
Child Care always got a one-time rate
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
increase the first year of the biennium
 
03:24:25.729 --> 03:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
which then carried out in the second
 
03:24:28.010 --> 03:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
I guess this is for either
 
03:24:30.889 --> 03:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
Mr White or Mr Ripple right how much is
 
03:24:40.330 --> 03:24:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:43.309 --> 03:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
sure so so as representative Wallner
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
indicated that there's approximately 67
 
03:24:48.950 --> 03:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:51.050 --> 03:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
and how much of that 67 is already
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
allocated for the next biennium
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that's the the the balance amount
 
03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
and I think with that answer though it's
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
important to remember that they're only
 
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's not like you can take that money
 
03:25:08.750 --> 03:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
and use it for the rate increase or
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
anything it's there are very very
 
03:25:13.729 --> 03:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
specific reasons that you can use it in
 
03:25:15.050 --> 03:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
child care
 
03:25:18.769 --> 03:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
is one of those reasons because the goal
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
of that whole is to get
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
to get people working and keep people
 
03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:26.990 align:start position:0%
to get people working and keep people
working

03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.809 --> 03:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm Dreaming up other things would
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
that there was a discussion about
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
us covering child care
 
03:25:39.650 --> 03:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
at something like eleven thousand
 
03:25:41.389 --> 03:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
dollars per child
 
03:25:44.210 --> 03:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago is that money eligible for
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
funding some of that partially as well
 
03:25:48.590 --> 03:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
that line item
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
well that that's what that's what it
 
03:25:54.170 --> 03:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
covers okay that's what it covers and I
 
03:25:55.849 --> 03:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
think you and I had a conversation about
 
03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that it had been nine and then it
 
03:26:01.250 --> 03:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
jumped to 11 it seemed like a large jump
 
03:26:04.610 --> 03:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
but I think during the pandemic I I
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't know of what all the reasons might
 
03:26:09.050 --> 03:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
be that it went up that much
 
03:26:10.969 --> 03:26:10.979 align:start position:0%
the reimburse you know why it would have
 
03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
gone up that much per child but I think
 
03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic it was very
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
expensive and also
 
03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:19.490 align:start position:0%
expensive and also
um

03:26:19.490 --> 03:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:22.490 --> 03:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
a lot more I think families were a lot
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
lower income and child care is on a
 
03:26:27.410 --> 03:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
sliding fee scale so people at the
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
lowest income pay very little
 
03:26:31.849 --> 03:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
but everyone pays
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
every family pays
 
03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
on the sliding fee scale so it's there
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
may have been more low and very low
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
income kids on which would push the cost
 
03:26:47.929 --> 03:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:52.610 --> 03:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
other questions I have about five okay
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
um do you happen to know what account
 
03:27:00.650 --> 03:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:00.660 --> 03:27:02.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:27:02.530 --> 03:27:02.540 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
the child development program which is
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
on page 890 I heard you say 2977 yes on
 
03:27:13.550 --> 03:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
what page page 890.
 
03:27:13.560 --> 03:27:15.290 align:start position:0%
what page page 890.
okay

03:27:15.290 --> 03:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:15.300 --> 03:27:17.809 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:27:17.809 --> 03:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:19.610 --> 03:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
are the other two amendments you have
 
03:27:22.610 --> 03:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
related to this same subject area yes
 
03:27:22.620 --> 03:27:24.229 align:start position:0%
related to this same subject area yes
okay

03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:26.990 --> 03:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I've heard multiple times there are
 
03:27:30.650 --> 03:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
four uses of TANF and and one of them is
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
child care and I'm I've I've considered
 
03:27:37.969 --> 03:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
asking every time it's said what exactly
 
03:27:42.130 --> 03:27:42.140 align:start position:0%
are the four potential uses of TANF
 
03:27:44.690 --> 03:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
and I guess that's a Mr White question
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
sure so provide assistance in needy
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
families so that children may remain in
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
their homes and Independence of needy
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
parents on government benefits through
 
03:27:55.610 --> 03:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
work job preparation and marriage reduce
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
out of wedlock pregnancies and promote
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
the formation of families darn I was
 
03:28:04.610 --> 03:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
looking for bullet statements four
 
03:28:06.650 --> 03:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
simple bullet statements that's pretty
 
03:28:10.969 --> 03:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
close everything's so complex uh okay so
 
03:28:10.979 --> 03:28:12.110 align:start position:0%
close everything's so complex uh okay so
who

03:28:12.110 --> 03:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:28:15.769 --> 03:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
and how do people access this money who
 
03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
who is really eligible and then what
 
03:28:19.550 --> 03:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
what do they have to what Hoops do they
 
03:28:21.170 --> 03:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
have to jump through to get to the money
 
03:28:23.330 --> 03:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
well they have to jump through a lot of
 
03:28:23.340 --> 03:28:24.590 align:start position:0%
well they have to jump through a lot of
Hoops

03:28:24.590 --> 03:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hoops
 
03:28:26.210 --> 03:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
um you have to follow they have to be
 
03:28:28.250 --> 03:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
eligible they have to be financially
 
03:28:28.260 --> 03:28:29.510 align:start position:0%
eligible they have to be financially
eligible

03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
03:28:32.750 --> 03:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that they have to be
 
03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:33.710 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that they have to be
working

03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
this cannot go to families who are not
 
03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
this cannot go to families who are not
working

03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:28:39.170 --> 03:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
this goes to Working Families or
 
03:28:41.809 --> 03:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
families where the adults are in a
 
03:28:43.729 --> 03:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
training program you could have someone
 
03:28:47.690 --> 03:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
you know or I guess
 
03:28:51.170 --> 03:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.809 --> 03:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
so they have to apply through the
 
03:28:56.690 --> 03:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
they have to provide all the
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
documentation about their income
 
03:29:03.889 --> 03:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
they have to you know show
 
03:29:07.729 --> 03:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
pay stubs do all the do all that kind of
 
03:29:07.739 --> 03:29:09.490 align:start position:0%
pay stubs do all the do all that kind of
stuff

03:29:09.490 --> 03:29:09.500 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
03:29:11.450 --> 03:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:29:14.929 --> 03:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
they have to find a provider the
 
03:29:18.729 --> 03:29:18.739 align:start position:0%
provider needs to be licensed
 
03:29:18.739 --> 03:29:20.330 align:start position:0%
provider needs to be licensed
and

03:29:20.330 --> 03:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:20.340 --> 03:29:22.969 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:29:22.969 --> 03:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:26.650 --> 03:29:26.660 align:start position:0%
they can they can use they can use
 
03:29:28.490 --> 03:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
unlicensed care
 
03:29:30.530 --> 03:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
if it meets the regulations of
 
03:29:32.990 --> 03:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
unlicensed care which would be someone
 
03:29:35.809 --> 03:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
who was in their own home caring for
 
03:29:38.450 --> 03:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
three or less children so if your next
 
03:29:41.090 --> 03:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
door neighbor was willing to you know
 
03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
just take care of your child then they
 
03:29:44.929 --> 03:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
could receive the reimbursements the
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursements are different for
 
03:29:49.309 --> 03:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
different levels of child care so in
 
03:29:51.769 --> 03:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
home is a different rate than a
 
03:29:51.779 --> 03:29:53.269 align:start position:0%
home is a different rate than a
center-based

03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
center-based
 
03:29:56.210 --> 03:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
okay the babies are babies are paid more
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
than a toddler and toddlers are paid a
 
03:30:01.490 --> 03:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
little bit more than preschoolers and
 
03:30:03.290 --> 03:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
preschoolers are paid a little more than
 
03:30:07.309 --> 03:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
after schoolers okay and then uh I I
 
03:30:10.250 --> 03:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's already a system
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
where we do market rate surveys or that
 
03:30:17.090 --> 03:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
we have experience doing this true cost
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
of care mechanism analysis
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
well the market rate survey is well
 
03:30:25.010 --> 03:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
defined the federal government actually
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um that's where the idea behind the
 
03:30:30.769 --> 03:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
market rate survey came there is a move
 
03:30:33.070 --> 03:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
now to start to use
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
a cost of care model and I think the
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
department is has been exploring that
 
03:30:43.610 --> 03:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
but up to this point its rates have been
 
03:30:46.610 --> 03:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
set using this market rate survey and
 
03:30:48.410 --> 03:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
they've done it like I said every two
 
03:30:51.530 --> 03:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
years and they were they were they were
 
03:30:53.809 --> 03:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
required by the federal government to do
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
it every two years
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
they had to do it I believe now it might
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
have been changed every three and that's
 
03:31:03.410 --> 03:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
why we're off cycle here and we don't
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.490 --> 03:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know that there's Mr White
 
03:31:13.190 --> 03:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead question if I'm wrong in any of
 
03:31:16.610 --> 03:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
this I I I'm not as familiar with the
 
03:31:18.889 --> 03:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
specific details of the program but but
 
03:31:20.809 --> 03:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
everything seems consistent with what I
 
03:31:20.819 --> 03:31:22.429 align:start position:0%
everything seems consistent with what I
know

03:31:22.429 --> 03:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:31:22.439 --> 03:31:23.809 align:start position:0%
know
okay

03:31:23.809 --> 03:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:31:23.819 --> 03:31:24.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
so so basically with the reserve did I
 
03:31:30.650 --> 03:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
hear 57 or 67 million
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
67 million 67 67. okay thank you
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
um so 2.9 out of 67 million is not much
 
03:31:42.729 --> 03:31:42.739 align:start position:0%
but what other
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
that Reserve is there for a reason what
 
03:31:47.389 --> 03:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
what's the primary purpose of that
 
03:31:49.490 --> 03:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
reserve and who are the primary
 
03:31:53.450 --> 03:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
claimants upon that Reserve so we we
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
budget those TANF dollars in the various
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
accounts and we cost allocate TANF
 
03:31:57.960 --> 03:31:59.210 align:start position:0%
accounts and we cost allocate TANF
dollars

03:31:59.210 --> 03:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:32:01.490 --> 03:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
um to positions that that are serving
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
one of those four purposes within our
 
03:32:03.359 --> 03:32:04.610 align:start position:0%
one of those four purposes within our
budget

03:32:04.610 --> 03:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
um however what what we have seen in
 
03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
recent years is we have seen that cash
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
assistance dollars start to go down and
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
so traditionally we would be using a mix
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
of TANF and general fund dollars for the
 
03:32:19.849 --> 03:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
cash assistance purposes
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so as a result of of some of of some
 
03:32:26.450 --> 03:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
of that and in order to hit our Moe
 
03:32:28.729 --> 03:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
um you know we've had additional TANF
 
03:32:30.530 --> 03:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
dollars come in over the years that have
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
so long term is this a viable funding
 
03:32:39.410 --> 03:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
source or are we going to be coming back
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
to needing the budget for this at some
 
03:32:44.210 --> 03:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
point in the foreseeable future
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
um at the current juncture it seems like
 
03:32:49.849 --> 03:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
it's a viable uh solution and then would
 
03:32:52.130 --> 03:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
you consider a Sunset date on this is
 
03:32:53.929 --> 03:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
this only for two years or is this going
 
03:32:57.170 --> 03:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
to be permanent law maybe Mr Ripple
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
could tell us how this is crafted is
 
03:33:03.290 --> 03:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
this ongoing or just for this budget
 
03:33:06.650 --> 03:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
as drafted it would be ongoing
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
would you consider just doing it for
 
03:33:10.729 --> 03:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
this budget I would consider that
 
03:33:10.739 --> 03:33:11.929 align:start position:0%
this budget I would consider that
because

03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:33:14.210 --> 03:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
they are doing a market rate survey I
 
03:33:14.220 --> 03:33:15.769 align:start position:0%
they are doing a market rate survey I
believe

03:33:15.769 --> 03:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:33:19.969 --> 03:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
this fall or in the upcoming winter and
 
03:33:22.550 --> 03:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
then next budget cycle will be back on
 
03:33:22.560 --> 03:33:23.570 align:start position:0%
then next budget cycle will be back on
cycle

03:33:23.570 --> 03:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
with having the market rate information
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's just that this year we didn't have
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
it for the Department to include in the
 
03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
budget you want to do your one or your
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.530 --> 03:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
were there questions more about that
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
because I I thought it might make sense
 
03:33:43.490 --> 03:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
to see that all three of the other ones
 
03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
but I did have a question of Mr White is
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
there anything else that the that money
 
03:33:51.050 --> 03:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
could be allocated to in our within our
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
current budget that we have overlooked
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh nothing that my team has identified
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
typically we try to Leverage The TANF
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
dollars as much as we can because again
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
we behind the scenes during the summer
 
03:34:04.729 --> 03:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
and and fall we kind of go through a
 
03:34:07.490 --> 03:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
very painful process of trying to
 
03:34:09.290 --> 03:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
leverage all of our federal dollars as
 
03:34:10.969 --> 03:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
much as we can in order to hit that
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
three percent Target or whatever Target
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
we were required to hit per the
 
03:34:20.889 --> 03:34:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.410 --> 03:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.290 --> 03:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay am I right to say that this is the
 
03:34:59.570 --> 03:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
basically on the assumption that your
 
03:35:01.849 --> 03:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
your first amendment passes this one
 
03:35:05.090 --> 03:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
makes it 85 instead of 75 percent no
 
03:35:07.729 --> 03:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
okay I'll let you describe it though
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
this one the first one was for the
 
03:35:14.090 --> 03:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
provider rates it increased so so that
 
03:35:16.190 --> 03:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
the providers are paid what this one is
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
is basically family eligibility
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
allowing families up to 85 percent of
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
the median income
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
to receive
 
03:35:29.690 --> 03:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
child care assistance
 
03:35:32.870 --> 03:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
remember it is on a sliding fee scale so
 
03:35:36.769 --> 03:35:36.779 align:start position:0%
as you get up the higher your income the
 
03:35:40.370 --> 03:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
less of your less subsidy you will
 
03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
receive it slides
 
03:35:47.210 --> 03:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
um and at the top people do not get a
 
03:35:49.309 --> 03:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
very very much
 
03:35:49.319 --> 03:35:50.750 align:start position:0%
very very much
but

03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:35:53.450 --> 03:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the last few years is
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
with inflation
 
03:35:59.870 --> 03:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
with wages going up with housing costing
 
03:36:01.130 --> 03:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
so much more
 
03:36:03.889 --> 03:36:03.899 align:start position:0%
families are really struggling Child
 
03:36:06.530 --> 03:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
Care is a very expensive
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
child care costs for an infant is
 
03:36:14.090 --> 03:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
probably around 300 a week
 
03:36:14.100 --> 03:36:15.670 align:start position:0%
probably around 300 a week
and

03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:18.710 --> 03:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
well that may and that I'm that's
 
03:36:22.250 --> 03:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
probably that's probably the
 
03:36:26.570 --> 03:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's probably at the low end but it is
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
very expensive and families are really
 
03:36:31.630 --> 03:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
struggling and if you have two children
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's really even more so I think what
 
03:36:37.790 --> 03:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
we've heard we want people in the
 
03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:39.830 align:start position:0%
we've heard we want people in the
workforce

03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
03:36:43.729 --> 03:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
people need and want to be working but
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
Child Care is a barrier and this would
 
03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
allow families to be on until they until
 
03:36:53.330 --> 03:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
they're at 85 percent immediate but they
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
want would not be receiving a full
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
subsidy they would be receiving
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
like I said on this lighting C scale I
 
03:37:03.290 --> 03:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
do want to remind you and I one reason
 
03:37:05.210 --> 03:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
brought this in was because
 
03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a recognition in the
 
03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:12.410 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a recognition in the
legislature

03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:37:12.420 --> 03:37:13.910 align:start position:0%
legislature
that

03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:37:19.070 --> 03:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:19.080 --> 03:37:20.330 align:start position:0%
 
care

03:37:20.330 --> 03:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:37:23.210 --> 03:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
and probably education
 
03:37:26.450 --> 03:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
when their their incomes are lower than
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
85 percent of poverty and actually I
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
believe that in the past several weeks
 
03:37:35.570 --> 03:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion here
 
03:37:37.969 --> 03:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
about the education Freedom accounts
 
03:37:41.990 --> 03:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
being available to families who are in
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
this range I think it's 350 percent of
 
03:37:48.769 --> 03:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
poverty is what I heard it's been 300.
 
03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
300 I passed the house recently was 350.
 
03:37:54.410 --> 03:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay 350. of the federal poverty level
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
and so I was going to ask you just to
 
03:37:59.929 --> 03:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
get the two synchronized can we put this
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
instead of 85 percent of median can we
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
make this uh to the FPL
 
03:38:08.330 --> 03:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
yes and what would that be do you know
 
03:38:10.510 --> 03:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
I've got it right here
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
they are very similar 85 and 350 are
 
03:38:18.170 --> 03:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
very close the reason I used 85 was
 
03:38:20.210 --> 03:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
because that's the federal the way the
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
03:38:25.010 --> 03:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
refers to it in the child care
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
legislation but we can use we can use
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of poverty so
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
um at 85 percent of poverty 85 percent
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
of median for a family of
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
four you want to do a family of four
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred and two thousand dollars
 
03:38:50.809 --> 03:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
a year for
 
03:38:50.819 --> 03:38:54.229 align:start position:0%
a year for
350

03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
for a family of four
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
which is what has been talked about here
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's a hundred and five thousand dollars
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
a year
 
03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:06.110 align:start position:0%
a year
so

03:39:06.110 --> 03:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:08.750 --> 03:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
I started looking and it did they did
 
03:39:12.110 --> 03:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
line up almost exactly I guess
 
03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:13.370 align:start position:0%
line up almost exactly I guess
um

03:39:13.370 --> 03:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:16.670 --> 03:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
85 percent is a little bit less than 350
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
than the 350 percent but they do line up
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
since you have both of them there uh
 
03:39:25.070 --> 03:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
could you let's do the scenario of a
 
03:39:28.010 --> 03:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
single mom with one kid okay
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
so a single person with one child
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
that would be a family of two
 
03:39:38.830 --> 03:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
would be um 69
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
835 at 85 percent of median
 
03:39:46.750 --> 03:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
350 percent it would be 69 000 and 20 so
 
03:39:54.050 --> 03:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
they're very close they're very close
 
03:39:54.060 --> 03:39:55.250 align:start position:0%
they're very close they're very close
yeah

03:39:55.250 --> 03:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:39:57.170 --> 03:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative walner is it possible
 
03:39:59.090 --> 03:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
since you've collected that great data
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
to share that or get copies that's
 
03:40:02.330 --> 03:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
really nice to know
 
03:40:05.450 --> 03:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
yeah sure I I will have
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
I will ask somebody to make copies so
 
03:40:10.190 --> 03:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
the practicality of changing your
 
03:40:13.849 --> 03:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
language from 85 percent of median to
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
the F the family poverty level number of
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
for the 350
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
that would I think Aid in communicating
 
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
it to others in the legislature but it
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
sounds like it would make it more
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
difficult for the Department to match it
 
03:40:32.450 --> 03:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
to the federal guidelines I think the
 
03:40:35.450 --> 03:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
department now uses like
 
03:40:38.450 --> 03:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
they do use percentage I think now they
 
03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%
do use percent of of poverty so I think
 
03:40:44.210 --> 03:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
it would be natural to go to the 350. I
 
03:40:45.410 --> 03:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
think it would be
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
just as easy for them
 
03:40:50.570 --> 03:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know if the I do know that
 
03:40:53.929 --> 03:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the federal how would we
 
03:40:57.530 --> 03:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
have to go to exactly 85 I think we
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
would have to it wouldn't be 350 exactly
 
03:41:01.130 --> 03:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a little less I
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
would if it were me I I would want to
 
03:41:08.269 --> 03:41:08.279 align:start position:0%
see the exact same numbers used across
 
03:41:11.570 --> 03:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
the board okay so that legisl it's
 
03:41:13.729 --> 03:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
simpler for legislators to say oh that's
 
03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
the same as what we're doing in this
 
03:41:17.690 --> 03:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
other program that's the way I would do
 
03:41:19.849 --> 03:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
it and if the amount of money was just a
 
03:41:21.050 --> 03:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
little bit different and they're very
 
03:41:24.050 --> 03:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
small differences then that's okay
 
03:41:26.809 --> 03:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
so I think 350 I mean I would I think
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable to
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
me at least representative walner will
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
representative norgren has had her hand
 
03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
up for a while and then we'll come to
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
your representative hole Yeah I just
 
03:41:40.490 --> 03:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
03:41:43.250 --> 03:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
remind us all that the bottom line is
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
the it's more economical for the parent
 
03:41:48.650 --> 03:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
to be able to work
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
and put their child in child care then
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
have the costs so expensive that they
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
can't work and pay for it so I mean I
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
think the numbers that Mary Jane's
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
brought up are really important to the
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
bottom line for that family yeah there's
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
another non-determinable
 
03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
benefit here that's qualitative and not
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
quantifiable and that is there's there's
 
03:42:16.729 --> 03:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
inherent value and self-worth associated
 
03:42:18.889 --> 03:42:18.899 align:start position:0%
with being employed that you can't
 
03:42:21.050 --> 03:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
really put direct numbers around because
 
03:42:23.870 --> 03:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's a sort of a long-term investment in
 
03:42:27.170 --> 03:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
self-esteem I think you know not to
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
sound too sociable emotional yeah but
 
03:42:34.690 --> 03:42:34.700 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you
 
03:42:37.610 --> 03:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative walner so um is it safe
 
03:42:39.610 --> 03:42:39.620 align:start position:0%
to assume that we could rewrite
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1093 hotel to move over to the
 
03:42:47.090 --> 03:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
350 percent of the federal poverty level
 
03:42:47.100 --> 03:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
350 percent of the federal poverty level
as

03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
um a separate Amendment but similar in
 
03:42:55.010 --> 03:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
nature yes that would be fine
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
so and the same two questions of the
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
other one do you know what the price tag
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
the incremental price tag of this is and
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
are you and are you intending this for
 
03:43:06.889 --> 03:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
this budget or to be permanent
 
03:43:09.650 --> 03:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
well I I think it's written in a way
 
03:43:11.690 --> 03:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
that it's permanent it's my
 
03:43:11.700 --> 03:43:13.490 align:start position:0%
that it's permanent it's my
understanding

03:43:13.490 --> 03:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:43:13.500 --> 03:43:15.110 align:start position:0%
understanding
um

03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
but it could be reevaluated
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
in another in another budget I mean if
 
03:43:22.130 --> 03:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's more comfortable for people that
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
we look at it and maybe we'll have some
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
history I think it's difficult to
 
03:43:31.490 --> 03:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
estimate but the department has done an
 
03:43:31.500 --> 03:43:32.950 align:start position:0%
estimate but the department has done an
estimate

03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
and let me see if I can find it the
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:46.250 --> 03:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to be around seven
 
03:43:50.330 --> 03:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:43:50.340 --> 03:43:51.889 align:start position:0%
million dollars
which

03:43:51.889 --> 03:43:51.899 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:43:54.830 --> 03:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
we'll see I mean it's going to take a
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
while for
 
03:44:00.650 --> 03:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
this new eligibility to go into place
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a while for families
 
03:44:05.450 --> 03:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
to hear about it it's going to take I
 
03:44:07.370 --> 03:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
mean it's gonna it's not gonna happen
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
really overnight
 
03:44:12.349 --> 03:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
it's not like July 1st people are going
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
to be running in the door it's going to
 
03:44:16.849 --> 03:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
take a long time for it to really ramp
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
up so I don't think that we will draw
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
down so so if this is an 85 what's the
 
03:44:24.650 --> 03:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
current standard seven zero 70 or
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
something what's that I think it's like
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
65 for one group and I think there's a
 
03:44:33.650 --> 03:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
couple of different the 65 for one group
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
I can send a texter and find out in
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
about 10 seconds okay I think it's 65
 
03:44:38.700 --> 03:44:40.309 align:start position:0%
about 10 seconds okay I think it's 65
percent

03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay if if we do this it's at 7 million
 
03:44:47.210 --> 03:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
a year I I on an ongoing stable State
 
03:44:50.690 --> 03:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
basis seven million I I I'd feel more
 
03:44:53.090 --> 03:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing a sunset on it just so
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
that the next budget committee could
 
03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
look at it yeah I think that makes sense
 
03:44:59.330 --> 03:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
we can because then we'll have some real
 
03:45:02.570 --> 03:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
figures too do you have a third yes I do
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
have a third I if if you've passed these
 
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
two I may not so I don't know what I
 
03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you're going to pass
 
03:45:11.150 --> 03:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
them or not but
 
03:45:12.769 --> 03:45:12.779 align:start position:0%
I uh
 
03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
if you pass these two we might not need
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
them need the third one but I will I'll
 
03:45:19.130 --> 03:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
tell you about the third one
 
03:45:21.530 --> 03:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
Okay the third one
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
while that's being handed out
 
03:45:30.840 --> 03:45:32.330 align:start position:0%
while that's being handed out
just

03:45:32.330 --> 03:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
um the 350 percent of FPL lines up with
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
85 percent
 
03:45:41.210 --> 03:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
um where does 300 FPL line up is that
 
03:45:45.050 --> 03:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
that information because we're using 300
 
03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
of FPL and other portions in our
 
03:45:49.439 --> 03:45:51.950 align:start position:0%
of FPL and other portions in our
statutes

03:45:51.950 --> 03:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
in which statute we just proposed for
 
03:45:57.190 --> 03:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
the efas to go to 350.
 
03:46:00.290 --> 03:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
the current law is 300. right and that's
 
03:46:02.809 --> 03:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
why I was just just out of curiosity
 
03:46:04.610 --> 03:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
what's the difference that's a great
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
question I just you said other statutes
 
03:46:08.510 --> 03:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
and so I just wanted to know if we were
 
03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
using that FPL number somewhere else
 
03:46:13.729 --> 03:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to go back and look I
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
believe there is other places that we
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
were referencing at FPL
 
03:46:20.090 --> 03:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I've been wrestling in my head what
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
you just addressed which is our current
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
law is 300 FPL the house bill that we
 
03:46:30.490 --> 03:46:30.500 align:start position:0%
passed is 350 FPL yep
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
so the analogy would be since that house
 
03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
proposal has not been accepted by the
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
Senate nor has rhb2 if we had them at
 
03:46:43.969 --> 03:46:43.979 align:start position:0%
the same level then we're making the
 
03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
same argument to the Senate
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the argument I was
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
do you have what do you want you want to
 
03:46:57.889 --> 03:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
know what 300 percent of poverty is for
 
03:46:59.929 --> 03:46:59.939 align:start position:0%
a family of four and a single mom with
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
one right what is 300 FPL and what is
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.309 --> 03:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
um 300 of poverty is 90 000 for a family
 
03:47:14.410 --> 03:47:14.420 align:start position:0%
of four
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it's 59 160.
 
03:47:21.229 --> 03:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
for a family of two
 
03:47:21.239 --> 03:47:22.670 align:start position:0%
for a family of two
okay

03:47:22.670 --> 03:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
03:47:26.690 --> 03:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know what it is to relate it to
 
03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
median income because I only had median
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
income at 85. I'm sorry I didn't print
 
03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
all right I if there aren't any more
 
03:47:41.090 --> 03:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
questions why don't you tell us what
 
03:47:42.349 --> 03:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about your third one
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
okay the third one is very similar to
 
03:47:48.410 --> 03:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
what was in the budget two years ago
 
03:47:48.420 --> 03:47:50.269 align:start position:0%
what was in the budget two years ago
so

03:47:50.269 --> 03:47:50.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:53.090 --> 03:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
um two years ago
 
03:47:55.849 --> 03:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
we weren't sure whether this child care
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
whether the child care budget was going
 
03:48:02.090 --> 03:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
to actually be able to cover all the
 
03:48:05.570 --> 03:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
cost of child care during that biennium
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
well the pandemic hit a lot of things
 
03:48:12.290 --> 03:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
happened the drawdown wasn't nearly as
 
03:48:14.690 --> 03:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
fast as we thought it would be so I had
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment put in two years ago that
 
03:48:17.880 --> 03:48:20.030 align:start position:0%
this amendment put in two years ago that
if

03:48:20.030 --> 03:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:48:24.349 --> 03:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
the child care budget was drawn down
 
03:48:24.359 --> 03:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
the child care budget was drawn down
that

03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:28.010 --> 03:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
they could come to the department could
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee and have
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
TANF funds transferred so that we didn't
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
have to develop a wait list or ask
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
families to leave child care
 
03:48:40.610 --> 03:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
so it didn't end up happening we didn't
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
need it but
 
03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like dealt and suspenders
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
we don't this does not appropriate any
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
money it just allows the department the
 
03:48:55.190 --> 03:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
ability to come in case that
 
03:48:57.769 --> 03:48:57.779 align:start position:0%
um account gets low and there's a
 
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism in here that they'll
 
03:49:02.570 --> 03:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
be reporting on a regular basis to the
 
03:49:06.650 --> 03:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.570 --> 03:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay so that
 
03:49:11.570 --> 03:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
um I guess if the first two
 
03:49:14.450 --> 03:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
were put in place I wouldn't really need
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
this one anymore but
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay unless
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
unless the department feels different
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
what's the perception of the risk of the
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
of the funds in the child care account
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
running out in the next biennium we
 
03:49:34.729 --> 03:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
don't really know but I mean this is
 
03:49:37.849 --> 03:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
sort of a safety net do we need the
 
03:49:39.490 --> 03:49:39.500 align:start position:0%
safety net
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
it it would depend on um I mean I I
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
think part of that depends on whether
 
03:49:46.729 --> 03:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
there's any action on these two
 
03:49:46.739 --> 03:49:48.530 align:start position:0%
there's any action on these two
amendments

03:49:48.530 --> 03:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:49:48.540 --> 03:49:49.250 align:start position:0%
amendments
um

03:49:49.250 --> 03:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:52.250 --> 03:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
I I of course in from my perspective
 
03:49:55.130 --> 03:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
always appreciate this type of scenario
 
03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
where if if budgeted amounts and needs
 
03:50:00.530 --> 03:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
are not in alignment we do have an
 
03:50:03.229 --> 03:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
Avenue to come back through fiscal uh
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
so under any scenario you think this is
 
03:50:12.239 --> 03:50:13.010 align:start position:0%
so under any scenario you think this is
a

03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:50:15.050 --> 03:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
reasonable amendment to give the
 
03:50:17.690 --> 03:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
department flexibility it's it's in
 
03:50:19.370 --> 03:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
current chapter law
 
03:50:22.969 --> 03:50:22.979 align:start position:0%
um I I of course would appreciate it yes
 
03:50:25.010 --> 03:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
I I want to make sure I just heard you
 
03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
did you just say this is already in
 
03:50:29.330 --> 03:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
chaptered law or that you want to put
 
03:50:32.090 --> 03:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
this into chaptered law so so this is in
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is chapter 91 uh section 325 so is
 
03:50:38.110 --> 03:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
this redundant
 
03:50:40.370 --> 03:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
no so this expires at the end of the
 
03:50:40.380 --> 03:50:41.450 align:start position:0%
no so this expires at the end of the
biennium

03:50:41.450 --> 03:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:50:44.090 --> 03:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh so so this would reintroduce that
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
into the current hb2 which would expire
 
03:50:49.570 --> 03:50:49.580 align:start position:0%
at that point in time
 
03:50:52.610 --> 03:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay I understand that do you have more
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
you want to say
 
03:50:55.849 --> 03:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
or a question no I just you know I hope
 
03:50:58.130 --> 03:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
that I mean we've spent a lot of time on
 
03:50:59.809 --> 03:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
a lot of different services and this is
 
03:51:02.090 --> 03:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
one that I think
 
03:51:04.969 --> 03:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
is really important to both families I
 
03:51:06.410 --> 03:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to children
 
03:51:09.170 --> 03:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
because they're cared for in places that
 
03:51:12.130 --> 03:51:12.140 align:start position:0%
are inspected and are safe and
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
parents get desperate sometimes when
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
these kinds of
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
financial help to pay for child care
 
03:51:22.969 --> 03:51:22.979 align:start position:0%
they get desperate and use
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
child care that might be inappropriate
 
03:51:27.650 --> 03:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
because it's cheaper or
 
03:51:31.969 --> 03:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
you know mistakes have bad things happen
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's also really good for
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and for employers
 
03:51:40.190 --> 03:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
everybody talks about how many employees
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
they need including the state I mean a
 
03:51:45.290 --> 03:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
lot of this might help some State the
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
state in in recruiting some people
 
03:51:50.330 --> 03:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
to restate jobs
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of state jobs probably
 
03:51:55.190 --> 03:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
fall Within These these five these
 
03:51:57.229 --> 03:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
income levels
 
03:51:57.239 --> 03:51:58.250 align:start position:0%
income levels
so

03:51:58.250 --> 03:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:59.570 --> 03:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I hope
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:06.250 --> 03:52:06.260 align:start position:0%
I I I think I think I would like to
 
03:52:09.889 --> 03:52:09.899 align:start position:0%
caucus for your first two
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:15.170 --> 03:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
seems to have no general fund
 
03:52:17.630 --> 03:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
implication it's a flexibility measure
 
03:52:20.570 --> 03:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's already in existing law that's set
 
03:52:23.690 --> 03:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
to expire so this is this is simply
 
03:52:27.650 --> 03:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
looks to me to be a con continuity of
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
the okay
 
03:52:31.319 --> 03:52:32.929 align:start position:0%
the okay
um

03:52:32.929 --> 03:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:38.450 --> 03:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I'm predisposed to having us
 
03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:39.290 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I'm predisposed to having us
um

03:52:39.290 --> 03:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:41.410 --> 03:52:41.420 align:start position:0%
support the walner
 
03:52:44.690 --> 03:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
1060 Amendment
 
03:52:48.769 --> 03:52:48.779 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion particularly any
 
03:52:53.150 --> 03:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:53.160 --> 03:52:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
all right so show hands if you're in
 
03:53:01.570 --> 03:53:01.580 align:start position:0%
favor of one zero six zero
 
03:53:05.150 --> 03:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right so that's one thing
 
03:53:07.550 --> 03:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
I think the other two we probably need
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
to talk about but we're going to break
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
before two anyways so we'll have an
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity we won't listen you can just
 
03:53:15.849 --> 03:53:15.859 align:start position:0%
talk amongst yourselves
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's just hum louder
 
03:53:21.170 --> 03:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
um we're I I'm still waiting for
 
03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
representative leishman to come in on
 
03:53:28.490 --> 03:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
the on the pdab I see uh is it Merchant
 
03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
or Merchant I've heard people doing the
 
03:53:32.690 --> 03:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
whole French thing on you and then I I'm
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
butchering you up with Merchant
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
you'll take either
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:49.250 --> 03:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay all right but I don't want to get
 
03:53:51.050 --> 03:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
into your ancestry that could start a
 
03:53:51.060 --> 03:53:52.670 align:start position:0%
into your ancestry that could start a
fight

03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
fight
 
03:53:55.450 --> 03:53:55.460 align:start position:0%
um all right let's let's let's
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
did you have a question you got your
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
hand in the semi
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
you ready to jab me
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh all right so let's pick up
 
03:54:10.010 --> 03:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple before I jump knowing that I'm
 
03:54:13.969 --> 03:54:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.979 --> 03:54:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:17.809 --> 03:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
are we complete with everything up until
 
03:54:23.210 --> 03:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:24.830 --> 03:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
so in other words are you complete with
 
03:54:27.170 --> 03:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
everything on at the house bill 2 sheet
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah front and back with the exception
 
03:54:33.170 --> 03:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
of the pdab at the back
 
03:54:36.050 --> 03:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
and and with the exception of the rate
 
03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
increase on hold
 
03:54:41.389 --> 03:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
um yes okay so so we're I think we're
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
waiting on the rate increase paperwork
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
I have not yet sent the amendment
 
03:54:52.910 --> 03:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
requests to them
 
03:54:54.290 --> 03:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
um because I will need further
 
03:54:56.689 --> 03:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
information on that um oh you need the
 
03:54:59.570 --> 03:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts yes so um
 
03:55:01.729 --> 03:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
you think you can just guess we told you
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
how to calculate it I will send him over
 
03:55:06.410 --> 03:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
03:55:06.420 --> 03:55:09.830 align:start position:0%
okay all right
um

03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
we have one other I believe right we
 
03:55:15.250 --> 03:55:15.260 align:start position:0%
were going to revisit to to
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
223 relative to total budget as well as
 
03:55:22.010 --> 03:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
this body scanner
 
03:55:25.729 --> 03:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
but at least that's what my notes have
 
03:55:28.969 --> 03:55:28.979 align:start position:0%
so you just said 223 the sununa budget
 
03:55:31.490 --> 03:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
let's do that because I at least want to
 
03:55:33.530 --> 03:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
be able to throw away or lose track of
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
one piece of paper
 
03:55:38.090 --> 03:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
let's go to the sununu center
 
03:55:42.650 --> 03:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh we we got a spreadsheet earlier
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
to show how we would how the department
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
proposes to move the money into hb1
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know where my sheet is of course
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:03.050 --> 03:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion yesterday about the
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
scanner it sounds like the scanner cost
 
03:56:07.490 --> 03:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
is about three hundred thousand dollars
 
03:56:10.070 --> 03:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
to the best of the departments on
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge the first few years at least
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
enough years to get us through this full
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
budget cycle the the maintenance is
 
03:56:21.170 --> 03:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
included I've asked a couple of
 
03:56:23.809 --> 03:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
questions I didn't get answers back and
 
03:56:26.330 --> 03:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
and that is uh are are there training
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
costs in addition to that or or does the
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
initial training so that people know how
 
03:56:33.650 --> 03:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
to safely use the equipment is that is
 
03:56:36.010 --> 03:56:36.020 align:start position:0%
that part of the initial acquisition
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
so so we're we're still collecting
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
information but
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
um from what I understand to date
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
it would cover the initial installation
 
03:56:49.490 --> 03:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
costs and then the basic walk through to
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
show to show folks how to uh how to
 
03:56:53.330 --> 03:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
utilize it
 
03:56:56.809 --> 03:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
um I think I think that 250 to 300 000
 
03:56:58.729 --> 03:56:58.739 align:start position:0%
range would probably also give us
 
03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds for service any sort of
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
service work with any new purchase there
 
03:57:06.290 --> 03:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
there's a maintenance warranty that goes
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
along with that
 
03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully a brand new machine
 
03:57:12.170 --> 03:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
would not result in a heavy service cost
 
03:57:15.170 --> 03:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
and then I also asked if if this the
 
03:57:17.630 --> 03:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
Imaging was x-ray or something else
 
03:57:20.330 --> 03:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
because if it's x-ray I get just a
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
little concerned we may need a quality
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
assurance program that requires a
 
03:57:27.889 --> 03:57:27.899 align:start position:0%
physicists oversight along with
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
dosimetry monitoring sure so if I
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
remember correctly I believe the
 
03:57:35.870 --> 03:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
brochure that was sent to you I think it
 
03:57:38.689 --> 03:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
said it I don't remember what the what
 
03:57:41.210 --> 03:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
the measurement unit was but I think it
 
03:57:43.130 --> 03:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
could be utilized a thousand times a
 
03:57:44.689 --> 03:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
year or something like that and still
 
03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
fall within standard Safety Code for
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
that particular model that we had
 
03:57:52.010 --> 03:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
identified was this a millimeter
 
03:57:53.570 --> 03:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
waveform representative hole do you have
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
a question I do thank you sorry was this
 
03:57:57.650 --> 03:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
millimeter wavelength typical of the
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
airport scanning type I it's it's
 
03:58:02.210 --> 03:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
similar I I cannot recall I'm honestly
 
03:58:04.849 --> 03:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
not very familiar with with it
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay question
 
03:58:09.950 --> 03:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
I would doubt it's x-ray or it wouldn't
 
03:58:11.689 --> 03:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
detect a lot of the things that they
 
03:58:13.490 --> 03:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
wanted attach I'm guessing it's the ones
 
03:58:15.170 --> 03:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
that go around you in circles in the
 
03:58:15.180 --> 03:58:16.309 align:start position:0%
that go around you in circles in the
airport

03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
airport
 
03:58:18.769 --> 03:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
no the email was with the information
 
03:58:21.290 --> 03:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
was sent yesterday at 12 29 from Mr
 
03:58:23.330 --> 03:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
Ripple with um the two attachments to
 
03:58:24.650 --> 03:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
the product I don't know if anyone wants
 
03:58:27.050 --> 03:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
it yeah I I saw the two attachments I I
 
03:58:30.769 --> 03:58:30.779 align:start position:0%
did not read them I did skim them but
 
03:58:34.429 --> 03:58:34.439 align:start position:0%
um okay so I've corresponded with Mr
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
Ripple or not Ripple I do that all the
 
03:58:43.130 --> 03:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
time but Mr ribson and he said that
 
03:58:45.530 --> 03:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
if we could provide some flexibility
 
03:58:49.010 --> 03:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
within his expense account lines expense
 
03:58:49.020 --> 03:58:49.910 align:start position:0%
within his expense account lines expense
lines

03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
that he would not need an incremental
 
03:58:56.210 --> 03:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
300 000 above what he's requested
 
03:58:58.370 --> 03:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
is that is that what he told you is that
 
03:59:00.110 --> 03:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
what do you understand yes that's what
 
03:59:02.090 --> 03:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
we talked about last night so so we
 
03:59:04.610 --> 03:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
would have to I guess Mr Ripple I guess
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's a footnote to to provide the
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to move money without coming
 
03:59:18.050 --> 03:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:20.689 --> 03:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
yeah you could do that as a footnote but
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
do we need to do it in a footnote if we
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
want them to have that flexibility uh
 
03:59:25.800 --> 03:59:30.769 align:start position:0%
want them to have that flexibility uh
typically

03:59:30.769 --> 03:59:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.969 --> 03:59:34.979 align:start position:0%
I think you do yes yes okay
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative hole do you want to do
 
03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about your observations
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
and thoughts sure
 
03:59:46.739 --> 03:59:48.170 align:start position:0%
and thoughts sure
so

03:59:48.170 --> 03:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:49.969 --> 03:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
um a couple things
 
03:59:49.979 --> 03:59:50.929 align:start position:0%
um a couple things
um

03:59:50.929 --> 03:59:50.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:53.090 --> 03:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna work through
 
03:59:54.530 --> 03:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
um this sheet that was just handed out
 
03:59:57.050 --> 03:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
that also includes positions
 
03:59:57.060 --> 03:59:58.670 align:start position:0%
that also includes positions
um

03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:00.530 --> 04:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a student population
 
04:00:02.689 --> 04:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
that's averaging
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
12 students thereabouts yet we have four
 
04:00:07.849 --> 04:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
full-time kitchen staff members and two
 
04:00:10.010 --> 04:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
part-time so we have six people who are
 
04:00:14.090 --> 04:00:14.100 align:start position:0%
helping cook meals for 12. um
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
teams High
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
um I could go through there's some other
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
areas similar the other area was in the
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
allocations of outside vendors
 
04:00:25.250 --> 04:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
um we're spending two thousand dollars
 
04:00:28.130 --> 04:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
per year per child although there are
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
children going through so you're going
 
04:00:31.729 --> 04:00:31.739 align:start position:0%
to need it's not right you may have
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
multiple children filling that one spot
 
04:00:36.050 --> 04:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
but we're we're on the order of two
 
04:00:37.550 --> 04:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per child per year in
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
labs and we're spending almost 1.8
 
04:00:43.010 --> 04:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
million in outside contract metals
 
04:00:46.130 --> 04:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
medical costs when we have two hospitals
 
04:00:50.630 --> 04:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:53.929 --> 04:00:53.939 align:start position:0%
I would like to propose kind of uh let
 
04:00:55.849 --> 04:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
the department manage this the way they
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
want but cap the total spend at 10
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars or 9.99 million dollars
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:12.889 --> 04:01:12.899 align:start position:0%
okay so I hear your initial bill bid to
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
be 10 million dollars plus they get the
 
04:01:20.809 --> 04:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
300 000 scanner but in exchange we give
 
04:01:22.610 --> 04:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
them whatever flexibility they need
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
within this total funding to to move the
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
money within the expenses that is
 
04:01:28.080 --> 04:01:29.929 align:start position:0%
money within the expenses that is
correct

04:01:29.929 --> 04:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
do you I it's not fair without Mr ribs
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
in here but I'm sure you know what to
 
04:01:36.239 --> 04:01:38.389 align:start position:0%
in here but I'm sure you know what to
say

04:01:38.389 --> 04:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
I mean this this is a 24-hour facility
 
04:01:43.969 --> 04:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
safety is key in Paramount here
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the facility I mean we already
 
04:01:48.050 --> 04:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
experience a 33 loss in our cpsw
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
positions last last summer into the fall
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
and we're still dealing with the Fallout
 
04:01:54.769 --> 04:01:54.779 align:start position:0%
from that to try to get the to try to
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
get everything fully staffed
 
04:01:59.210 --> 04:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
um I don't think 10 million dollars
 
04:02:00.769 --> 04:02:00.779 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient and what we'd end up
 
04:02:02.269 --> 04:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
doing is based I mean it'd basically be
 
04:02:03.650 --> 04:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
in a back of the budget cut and we'd
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
have to transfer funds from from other
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
areas the the the 890 and 900 000 that's
 
04:02:12.650 --> 04:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
part of a contracted
 
04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
um I mean those are contracted costs and
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
those are paid only if if those
 
04:02:19.250 --> 04:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
positions are filled those positions are
 
04:02:20.510 --> 04:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
currently filled we went out to
 
04:02:23.210 --> 04:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
competitive bid for those costs just as
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
far as a major driver and I think Joe
 
04:02:27.410 --> 04:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
already spoke to the the youth counselor
 
04:02:27.420 --> 04:02:28.610 align:start position:0%
already spoke to the the youth counselor
costs

04:02:28.610 --> 04:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:02:31.849 --> 04:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I think
 
04:02:34.490 --> 04:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
I I mean I think having a footnote to
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
purchase that body scanner and any
 
04:02:37.969 --> 04:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
maintenance services surrounding there
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
would would certainly be helpful but
 
04:02:42.650 --> 04:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
overall I know that
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
um be kind of concerned to to a cut the
 
04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
actual funds to it because we probably
 
04:02:52.010 --> 04:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have funding sufficient and B
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
sent another message to staff that we're
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
not supporting this fully
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we're not done because we're done
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're done because it's two o'clock and
 
04:03:05.710 --> 04:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
people needed to take off at two o'clock
 
04:03:10.130 --> 04:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:16.010 --> 04:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:18.349 --> 04:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
I don't want to recess
 
04:03:20.929 --> 04:03:20.939 align:start position:0%
um if we still have people we need to
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
continue what it'd be a good time to
 
04:03:26.689 --> 04:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.950 --> 04:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
I'll just I'll just say this
 
04:03:39.290 --> 04:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
um I think under all the legislative
 
04:03:41.450 --> 04:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
scenarios I've seen
 
04:03:44.570 --> 04:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
that the Youth Development Center
 
04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
is going to be encouraged to begin
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
transitioning to the new methods of
 
04:03:48.960 --> 04:03:50.929 align:start position:0%
transitioning to the new methods of
operating

04:03:50.929 --> 04:03:50.939 align:start position:0%
operating
 
04:03:50.939 --> 04:03:51.650 align:start position:0%
operating
um

04:03:51.650 --> 04:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:51.660 --> 04:03:52.929 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:03:52.929 --> 04:03:52.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
we've included virtual you know remote
 
04:03:57.600 --> 04:03:59.030 align:start position:0%
we've included virtual you know remote
services

04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:04:01.250 --> 04:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
one of the targets for that
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
to me has always been your medical staff
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
seems excessive
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
if you had L A's there with some
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
telemedicine capability to more robust
 
04:04:14.580 --> 04:04:15.650 align:start position:0%
telemedicine capability to more robust
treatment

04:04:15.650 --> 04:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:04:18.769 --> 04:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
and you had reasonable access to
 
04:04:18.779 --> 04:04:20.389 align:start position:0%
and you had reasonable access to
ambulances

04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
ambulances
 
04:04:24.170 --> 04:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me like a huge enormous
 
04:04:27.530 --> 04:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
over expenditure on the medical lines
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
and if you got that right sized
 
04:04:33.650 --> 04:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
in my view without having the detailed
 
04:04:33.660 --> 04:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
in my view without having the detailed
discussion

04:04:35.090 --> 04:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
you would be halfway between where you
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
are now and what representative hole is
 
04:04:40.969 --> 04:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
so do you have any thoughts on
 
04:04:46.910 --> 04:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
trying to use telemedicine to reduce
 
04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
your medical staff sure we I mean we I
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
can't really speak to the clinical needs
 
04:04:55.130 --> 04:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
of the of the children however they they
 
04:04:58.429 --> 04:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
are acute and you know just just from uh
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
a dollar's perspective with the
 
04:05:02.269 --> 04:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
contracts we just went out to bid for
 
04:05:03.889 --> 04:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
this and we just had new contracts
 
04:05:03.899 --> 04:05:05.510 align:start position:0%
this and we just had new contracts
signed

04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
signed
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
um this past January or February of last
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
year so those have been competitively
 
04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
bid to try to get the most reasonable
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
rates to bring in the clinicians and the
 
04:05:17.150 --> 04:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry psychologists and
 
04:05:20.809 --> 04:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists for those services and and
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
those are the rates that were contracted
 
04:05:24.170 --> 04:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
for today
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
so so I would make a distinction between
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the clinical and the psychologists the
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
psychologists are all part of the new
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
mission mission I think
 
04:05:37.610 --> 04:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
I want to see the final proposal at some
 
04:05:39.229 --> 04:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
point but
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it seemed to me like there was there
 
04:05:44.769 --> 04:05:44.779 align:start position:0%
was an over emphasis on the clinical
 
04:05:47.929 --> 04:05:47.939 align:start position:0%
capability there
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
instead of the psychological or mental
 
04:05:50.760 --> 04:05:51.530 align:start position:0%
instead of the psychological or mental
health

04:05:51.530 --> 04:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
and so that clinical side
 
04:05:57.889 --> 04:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
seemed overstaffed to me when when you
 
04:05:59.950 --> 04:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
could you could do a telemedicine
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
station there and somebody who can
 
04:06:06.290 --> 04:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
handle first aid well
 
04:06:10.490 --> 04:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
coupled with evacuation capabilities and
 
04:06:14.210 --> 04:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
you have adequate medical support from a
 
04:06:17.090 --> 04:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
clinical perspective that's the kind of
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
stuff I used to do in the olden days
 
04:06:23.689 --> 04:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
the the mental health side of it is
 
04:06:27.170 --> 04:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
probably what it should be but
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
um all right I I think I think we need
 
04:06:31.729 --> 04:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
to just sort of table this and set this
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
issue aside until representative hole
 
04:06:37.510 --> 04:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
can come back yes sir go ahead so
 
04:06:40.969 --> 04:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth who's usually the only bidder
 
04:06:40.979 --> 04:06:42.590 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth who's usually the only bidder
890

04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
890
 
04:06:45.530 --> 04:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
000 going to 916 000. does that include
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
all the nurse staff or is that in
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
04:06:52.189 --> 04:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
so there there is
 
04:06:54.429 --> 04:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
um there's a part-time registered nurse
 
04:06:57.769 --> 04:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
uh position in the staff count there on
 
04:07:00.429 --> 04:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
the right and then there is also uh five
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
registered nurses one nurse specialist
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.769 --> 04:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
and then I see the Dartmouth medical
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
staff at you know the 890 000. is that
 
04:07:15.650 --> 04:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
inclusive of that staff that we just
 
04:07:18.410 --> 04:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
noticed no so those positions there
 
04:07:21.290 --> 04:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
those are classified state employees
 
04:07:23.689 --> 04:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
um the the contracted line includes the
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
psychologists clinicians uh that that
 
04:07:28.490 --> 04:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
Joe had referred to the other day when
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
he was here
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
those are the ones in the Dartmouth
 
04:07:35.330 --> 04:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
contract that is correct yes how many
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head I believe
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
there was a part-time psychiatrist a
 
04:07:43.130 --> 04:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
psychologist to clinicians and there may
 
04:07:45.530 --> 04:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
a pediatrician and a pediatrician thank
 
04:07:45.540 --> 04:07:47.450 align:start position:0%
a pediatrician and a pediatrician thank
you

04:07:47.450 --> 04:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:07:49.610 --> 04:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth has never treated us very well
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
since they're paying taxes on their
 
04:07:51.359 --> 04:07:55.969 align:start position:0%
since they're paying taxes on their
dormitories

04:07:55.969 --> 04:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay so did you also have a question
 
04:07:58.319 --> 04:08:00.530 align:start position:0%
okay so did you also have a question
representative

04:08:00.530 --> 04:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:05.150 --> 04:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative walner
 
04:08:07.490 --> 04:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
as I recall it was this budget
 
04:08:09.530 --> 04:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
discussion two years ago that triggered
 
04:08:11.450 --> 04:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
everyone to saying let's close the thing
 
04:08:11.460 --> 04:08:12.469 align:start position:0%
everyone to saying let's close the thing
down

04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
where are you this year
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
is this what do you want to do about
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.150 --> 04:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
well if we put the book they like the
 
04:08:25.130 --> 04:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
idea of putting a footnote in there to
 
04:08:28.010 --> 04:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
allow them this flexibility
 
04:08:28.020 --> 04:08:28.969 align:start position:0%
allow them this flexibility
um

04:08:28.969 --> 04:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
if they also include buying the scanner
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think I had enough
 
04:08:37.130 --> 04:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
discussion with them at this point to to
 
04:08:40.130 --> 04:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
really make a decision about this but I
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
think we have to go I I personally think
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to go with what
 
04:08:46.610 --> 04:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.250 --> 04:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
so there's been a vacancy rate over
 
04:08:49.260 --> 04:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
so there's been a vacancy rate over
there

04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
do do we need all the Personnel money in
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.929 --> 04:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
yes because what we've had to do
 
04:09:02.090 --> 04:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
um is we've had to bring staff in from
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
across the department who have either
 
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
familiar familiarity with working or
 
04:09:10.370 --> 04:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
formally worked at sysc to provide the
 
04:09:12.050 --> 04:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
overtime so there's been a series of
 
04:09:13.990 --> 04:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
transfers through the fiscal process
 
04:09:17.150 --> 04:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
we've also had to renew a staffing
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
contract a number of times whereby we
 
04:09:22.250 --> 04:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
have pulled in youth counselors through
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
a contracted service to cover shifts as
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
Joe had indicated before because we're
 
04:09:29.570 --> 04:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
kind of having to bring in both
 
04:09:31.610 --> 04:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
contracted staff and we've had to bring
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
in staff who this is not their primary
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
job but they have some familiarity with
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
it and can fulfill the functions because
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
of that you know when when we've been
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
04:09:43.130 --> 04:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
Staffing we've had to make sure that we
 
04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
have at least one extra if not more
 
04:09:47.150 --> 04:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances to
 
04:09:51.110 --> 04:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
address that so um long story short no
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
so I'll tell you a story I don't know if
 
04:09:56.030 --> 04:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's true or not but
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
on the line for medical payments to
 
04:09:58.560 --> 04:09:59.689 align:start position:0%
on the line for medical payments to
providers

04:09:59.689 --> 04:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
here we've had physician and nursing
 
04:10:02.760 --> 04:10:03.550 align:start position:0%
here we've had physician and nursing
staff

04:10:03.550 --> 04:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
staff
 
04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
on site
 
04:10:08.809 --> 04:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
and I had heard stories from multiple
 
04:10:08.819 --> 04:10:09.950 align:start position:0%
and I had heard stories from multiple
sources

04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
sources
 
04:10:12.889 --> 04:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
that the people that we had on staff the
 
04:10:15.469 --> 04:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
Physicians that could handle it were
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
very prone to just referring people out
 
04:10:21.170 --> 04:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the work and weren't
 
04:10:21.180 --> 04:10:22.750 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the work and weren't
particularly

04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
didn't particularly exhibit sort of the
 
04:10:28.370 --> 04:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
clinical dedication one might expect and
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
if that is the case I would hope that
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
somebody in management would take a look
 
04:10:35.210 --> 04:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
at that medical payments to provider
 
04:10:38.689 --> 04:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
line that's about a million dollars and
 
04:10:41.929 --> 04:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
wonder if that's really what it ought to
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.090 --> 04:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
you can't comment on that I can I just
 
04:10:51.530 --> 04:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
don't know where the stories come from
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's all yeah well they're at least
 
04:10:56.809 --> 04:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
two years old so maybe that person is
 
04:10:59.090 --> 04:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
rotated but it you know that whole
 
04:11:02.689 --> 04:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
medical support concept to me was just
 
04:11:02.699 --> 04:11:03.650 align:start position:0%
medical support concept to me was just
really

04:11:03.650 --> 04:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:11:03.660 --> 04:11:04.490 align:start position:0%
really
um

04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:07.969 --> 04:11:07.979 align:start position:0%
just it just smelled of waste and that
 
04:11:09.769 --> 04:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of the reason I got
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I have a comment go ahead
 
04:11:17.570 --> 04:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
you were asking representative Wallner
 
04:11:21.290 --> 04:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
you know her view on things and
 
04:11:25.370 --> 04:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
the way I look at this is we know that
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
the new facility is coming
 
04:11:29.809 --> 04:11:29.819 align:start position:0%
and because we know that and that we
 
04:11:32.450 --> 04:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
have another at least two years ahead of
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
us we know that we have to work within
 
04:11:37.130 --> 04:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
the the confines of the existing
 
04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
um situation which has its own kitchen
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
its own laundry and all those things
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we've we've heard over and over and
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
over again and unfortunately in order to
 
04:11:48.410 --> 04:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
keep a facility that's safe and doing
 
04:11:50.809 --> 04:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
the work that we have to do to make sure
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
that these children are cared for and in
 
04:11:57.650 --> 04:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
a safe controlled setting being educated
 
04:11:59.809 --> 04:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
getting treatment
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're sort of stuck with
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
what we have here this is the hole that
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've dug for ourselves for the time
 
04:12:06.000 --> 04:12:06.710 align:start position:0%
we've dug for ourselves for the time
being

04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:12:09.530 --> 04:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
so I am very appreciative to hear that
 
04:12:11.689 --> 04:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
the committee is open to going for the
 
04:12:13.729 --> 04:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
scanner that to me what we heard
 
04:12:13.739 --> 04:12:15.050 align:start position:0%
scanner that to me what we heard
yesterday

04:12:15.050 --> 04:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:12:18.110 --> 04:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
upset me extremely so I'm very pleased
 
04:12:20.570 --> 04:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
that that is now in play
 
04:12:23.150 --> 04:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
um but as far as finding other ways to
 
04:12:25.490 --> 04:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
cut I just I just don't see it without
 
04:12:27.050 --> 04:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
sacrificing the safety of the children
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
so that's my two cents
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
there's more going on in this account
 
04:12:33.070 --> 04:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
than safety though
 
04:12:35.570 --> 04:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
everything about the safety part of it
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're absolutely in aligned with I my
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
sense after looking at this budget now
 
04:12:45.410 --> 04:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
over four budget years
 
04:12:47.530 --> 04:12:47.540 align:start position:0%
is still
 
04:12:51.650 --> 04:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
that it hasn't been staffed at an
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
efficient level to accomplish the things
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
it really needs to accomplish it just
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
has always felt like the head count is
 
04:13:01.070 --> 04:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
wrong and I'm not in a position to go in
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
there and make changes and say okay
 
04:13:06.410 --> 04:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
instead of you know four RNs you only
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
need two you know but I I I just think
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
I would have liked to have seen the
 
04:13:16.250 --> 04:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
department come back with a tighter
 
04:13:19.130 --> 04:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
better head count
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
my response to that is it's a 24-hour
 
04:13:24.889 --> 04:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
facility of course and we need we need a
 
04:13:26.929 --> 04:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
medical professional in there 24 hours a
 
04:13:28.849 --> 04:13:28.859 align:start position:0%
day and I'm sure that
 
04:13:30.889 --> 04:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
um you know as I was taking notes here
 
04:13:33.410 --> 04:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know there are multiple services
 
04:13:35.150 --> 04:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
that need to be provided by those nurses
 
04:13:37.849 --> 04:13:37.859 align:start position:0%
so I guess all I'm saying is
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we have a unique situation that
 
04:13:42.170 --> 04:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
we're Bound by the structure that we
 
04:13:44.750 --> 04:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
have and and the the system that we have
 
04:13:47.809 --> 04:13:47.819 align:start position:0%
and I just I I am a little wary of
 
04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
of cutting
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
um those professionals that um they say
 
04:13:54.650 --> 04:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
they need to keep things functioning you
 
04:13:56.929 --> 04:13:56.939 align:start position:0%
know we're not that far away if we go
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
the whole route that's 10 million this
 
04:14:03.290 --> 04:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
is 11.1 that's it's not a huge Delta go
 
04:14:03.300 --> 04:14:05.870 align:start position:0%
is 11.1 that's it's not a huge Delta go
ahead

04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.990 --> 04:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
asked Nathan if he could tell us what
 
04:14:13.849 --> 04:14:13.859 align:start position:0%
did we spend in 22 or actual
 
04:14:13.859 --> 04:14:15.969 align:start position:0%
did we spend in 22 or actual
okay

04:14:15.969 --> 04:14:15.979 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:18.410 --> 04:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
well I mean that's the actual right
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
because 23 hasn't closed out yet
 
04:14:22.380 --> 04:14:29.830 align:start position:0%
because 23 hasn't closed out yet
foreign

04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.650 --> 04:14:32.660 align:start position:0%
a couple of reports
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
so so if you could continue to work on
 
04:14:40.610 --> 04:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
and Nathan 2022 also had Revenue though
 
04:14:43.680 --> 04:14:50.630 align:start position:0%
and Nathan 2022 also had Revenue though
right

04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.570 --> 04:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
yes I
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
all right I I just need a couple minutes
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.370 --> 04:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
it's on page 896.
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
we're ready to I think to pause the
 
04:15:11.689 --> 04:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
sununu issue anyways until
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
and we still need to work through the
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:34.800 --> 04:15:38.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:15:38.530 --> 04:15:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
ninety seven
 
04:15:42.290 --> 04:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
that was the actual expense if you
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
recall from the Senate bill one
 
04:15:47.150 --> 04:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
discussion uh the 23 Figures were
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
projected to be a bit higher because of
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
overtime costs and I think some other
 
04:15:51.540 --> 04:16:01.429 align:start position:0%
overtime costs and I think some other
factors

04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
representative norgren and
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
this has a covid and the issues every
 
04:16:18.889 --> 04:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
facility was dealing with so they might
 
04:16:20.210 --> 04:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
not be
 
04:16:23.450 --> 04:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
the same as we would need now
 
04:16:25.929 --> 04:16:25.939 align:start position:0%
I don't think we ever hit the covid
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
stuff in either budget it last last time
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
around the budget had been developed
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
before pre-covered I was still
 
04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
pre-covered and now I think this budget
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
is intended to be sort of post-covered
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
and so somehow the covid
 
04:16:41.939 --> 04:16:45.710 align:start position:0%
and so somehow the covid
missed

04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.720 --> 04:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:16:47.590 --> 04:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:16:50.809 --> 04:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
but who knows what our next infectious
 
04:16:50.819 --> 04:16:51.889 align:start position:0%
but who knows what our next infectious
control

04:16:51.889 --> 04:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
problem ought to be
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
I I would like to stop talking about the
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
sununu center for a little while and
 
04:17:01.010 --> 04:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
start talking about these other items
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
because we need our two
 
04:17:06.050 --> 04:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
certainly representative holdback
 
04:17:06.060 --> 04:17:06.769 align:start position:0%
certainly representative holdback
um

04:17:06.769 --> 04:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.250 --> 04:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
item two these are just technical
 
04:17:16.490 --> 04:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
corrections I don't if the if those are
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
just technical corrections I don't see
 
04:17:20.150 --> 04:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
any reason why we just wouldn't approve
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
those and two is grayed out you've
 
04:17:25.729 --> 04:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
already approved them oh okay good I
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
like remaking the same decision it's
 
04:17:27.840 --> 04:17:28.809 align:start position:0%
like remaking the same decision it's
faster

04:17:28.809 --> 04:17:28.819 align:start position:0%
faster
 
04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh okay the home visiting formula grant
 
04:17:37.610 --> 04:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
for a million dollars over the two years
 
04:17:40.969 --> 04:17:40.979 align:start position:0%
we put this on hold
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
why did we put this on representative
 
04:17:47.929 --> 04:17:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
so so we've gone to the horse blanket
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
here the bigger paper on uh status of
 
04:17:56.330 --> 04:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
actions related hb1 and we're looking at
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
item five and we remember that that you
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
had some discussion on this you wanted
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.370 --> 04:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
I just think that it's
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
home visiting I think we can really
 
04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
reach some of the families that some of
 
04:18:18.110 --> 04:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
our families that are really
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
most in need and try to prevent these
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
things I mean if we get to these
 
04:18:24.650 --> 04:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
families early
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to help and home visiting is
 
04:18:30.010 --> 04:18:30.020 align:start position:0%
has been proven to be a very
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
successful way of reaching families
 
04:18:34.969 --> 04:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday did we talk about there being
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
up to 500 children who would receive
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
visits with this program and it was a
 
04:18:43.680 --> 04:18:44.750 align:start position:0%
visits with this program and it was a
three-year

04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
three-year
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
three-year program for the family for so
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
he'd get home visiting I assume from the
 
04:18:52.729 --> 04:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
time they were infants up until they
 
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
were ready to go to preschool or three
 
04:18:59.929 --> 04:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
years old so I think it really
 
04:19:02.929 --> 04:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
probably one of the best ways of really
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
reaching fam those families that in our
 
04:19:08.570 --> 04:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
communities that are the most in need so
 
04:19:13.010 --> 04:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and okay so I think um
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think Trish
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
no um Tilly talked about this when she
 
04:19:21.530 --> 04:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
was here you talked about how important
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
these programs are yes that is correct
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
it was originally for 1.25 million
 
04:19:29.150 --> 04:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
dollars each year
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but based on some updated information
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
relative to that to the match required
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the federal side uh that has been
 
04:19:38.030 --> 04:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
reduced to the 525 each year you see
 
04:19:38.040 --> 04:19:39.469 align:start position:0%
reduced to the 525 each year you see
there

04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.090 --> 04:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:51.650 --> 04:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
and is this sheet I'm I'm sorry I need
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
to know this already but is this is this
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs sheet as well or
 
04:20:02.210 --> 04:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
or is there yet another piece of paper
 
04:20:04.490 --> 04:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
somewhere with prioritized needs for us
 
04:20:06.530 --> 04:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
um so I believe in Kevin correct me if
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong I believe you took the earlier
 
04:20:15.170 --> 04:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
DHHS prioritized needs hb1 request and
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
moved it into the status of actions
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
related to hb1
 
04:20:30.110 --> 04:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:32.210 --> 04:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
so this is all currently federal funds
 
04:20:42.050 --> 04:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know that I heard
 
04:20:46.849 --> 04:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
the answer because I'm I'm deaf uh yes
 
04:20:49.610 --> 04:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
is this the is this that this is the
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs sheet
 
04:20:54.410 --> 04:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
this item was taken from the
 
04:20:56.929 --> 04:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
prioritizing each sheet okay so it's a
 
04:21:00.650 --> 04:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.050 --> 04:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
earlier you had a documents
 
04:21:04.969 --> 04:21:04.979 align:start position:0%
um that looked like this it contained
 
04:21:06.530 --> 04:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
technical requests that you voted on
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
yeah some other that you've mostly voted
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
on and some prioritized needs
 
04:21:11.760 --> 04:21:12.410 align:start position:0%
on and some prioritized needs
um

04:21:12.410 --> 04:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
those prioritized needs are shown here
 
04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm sorry I'm being sort of
 
04:21:20.809 --> 04:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
kindergarten on this if if if we
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
complete all of the items on the
 
04:21:26.150 --> 04:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
tentative actions related to hb2 this
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
and all of the actions on on this horse
 
04:21:31.729 --> 04:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
blanket for status of actions related to
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:39.170 --> 04:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
outstanding amendments
 
04:21:40.910 --> 04:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct with the exception of
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
rate increase amendments and
 
04:21:43.439 --> 04:21:44.750 align:start position:0%
rate increase amendments and
um

04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
a revised a revised version of the back
 
04:21:50.090 --> 04:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
of the budget amendment that you talked
 
04:21:51.490 --> 04:21:51.500 align:start position:0%
about yesterday
 
04:21:53.929 --> 04:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
and one other amendment that I'm working
 
04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
on my Amendment isn't anywhere on these
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
sheets either which is still out in
 
04:22:00.650 --> 04:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
ether it is I believe on the status of
 
04:22:02.570 --> 04:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
actions related to House Bill one under
 
04:22:04.130 --> 04:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
the division of Behavioral Health on
 
04:22:08.689 --> 04:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.769 --> 04:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.809 --> 04:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
is medical expansion some around here as
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
well sorry Medicaid expansion is that on
 
04:22:18.650 --> 04:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
here as well
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
so Medicaid expansion is a new would be
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
a new house bill 2 Section I do have an
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
amendment related to that
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:31.610 --> 04:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
ask representative Edwards which one you
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
wanted me to hand out but yes that's
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
another that's another outstanding item
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
so so back to the home visiting thing so
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
we had the you got the grant the Federal
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
Grant and I assume you're already doing
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
a lot with that the 2.8 million dollars
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
roughly per year yes but historically
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
um this other component of it we've
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
received Governors commission funds for
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
that and then most recently ARP dollars
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
and the ARP dollars you won't you won't
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
see here
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
so during the current binding you have
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
arbit dollars that now you're trying to
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
replace essentially with the general
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:06.359 --> 04:23:07.849 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:23:07.849 --> 04:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:10.370 --> 04:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay so my bias at this point in the
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
process is anything that didn't make the
 
04:23:17.090 --> 04:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget that and is hung
 
04:23:19.849 --> 04:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
around as a prioritized need
 
04:23:22.849 --> 04:23:22.859 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm I'm not prone to wanting to
 
04:23:24.830 --> 04:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
approve it because I want as much money
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
as we can to put into the Medicaid rate
 
04:23:30.290 --> 04:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
that I'm just being transparent that's
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
sort of where I'm at
 
04:23:32.640 --> 04:23:33.950 align:start position:0%
sort of where I'm at
but

04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:23:36.429 --> 04:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm always open to listening
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
let's drop down to 10. System of care
 
04:23:44.030 --> 04:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.610 --> 04:23:45.620 align:start position:0%
what what
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about this long item Mr
 
04:23:52.969 --> 04:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
Mr White sure so uh just a year prior uh
 
04:23:55.210 --> 04:23:55.220 align:start position:0%
for the first time the department
 
04:23:59.090 --> 04:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
contracted with the the residential
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
um residential providers and
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
we entered into those contracts it was
 
04:24:07.490 --> 04:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
the first time it had ever been done
 
04:24:09.410 --> 04:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
previously we were paying them through
 
04:24:12.170 --> 04:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
the bridges system the purpose of the
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
contracts was to provide the department
 
04:24:14.990 --> 04:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
with better leverage better
 
04:24:15.000 --> 04:24:16.969 align:start position:0%
with better leverage better
understanding

04:24:16.969 --> 04:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:24:19.729 --> 04:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
um of of the services provided and then
 
04:24:22.490 --> 04:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
require certain standards to be met and
 
04:24:24.370 --> 04:24:24.380 align:start position:0%
so during that process
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
we established rates and we didn't have
 
04:24:29.090 --> 04:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of good information from the
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
providers for a variety of reasons uh
 
04:24:32.450 --> 04:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
part of it was just due to the
 
04:24:34.689 --> 04:24:34.699 align:start position:0%
restrictive nature of the procurement
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
process itself and keeping certain
 
04:24:40.370 --> 04:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
information confidential
 
04:24:43.490 --> 04:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
um these these contracts they they
 
04:24:45.410 --> 04:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
provide services
 
04:24:47.150 --> 04:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
um they're used to provide services to a
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
number of different number of different
 
04:24:50.750 --> 04:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
types of children and some of those
 
04:24:52.969 --> 04:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
qualify under Medicaid some of those
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
qualify under title 4E some are are
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
Foster Care others may not qualify under
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
any of that and may be generally funded
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so what this request is
 
04:25:07.370 --> 04:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of this request is to
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
provide additional funds because in the
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
in the year since we have looked at Cost
 
04:25:12.960 --> 04:25:14.210 align:start position:0%
in the year since we have looked at Cost
reports

04:25:14.210 --> 04:25:14.220 align:start position:0%
reports
 
04:25:16.490 --> 04:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
um of these various facilities to
 
04:25:18.110 --> 04:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
understand what are the costs that they
 
04:25:20.150 --> 04:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
are incurring related to the services
 
04:25:22.689 --> 04:25:22.699 align:start position:0%
that they are providing and based off of
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
many months of analysis
 
04:25:28.010 --> 04:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
um we we've we've determined that that
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
these amounts here would would make the
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
providers closer to whole for the
 
04:25:35.150 --> 04:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
services that they're providing
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
um and and I believe uh Joe and Katya
 
04:25:41.330 --> 04:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
both spoke to both spoke to this
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
prioritize need
 
04:25:46.670 --> 04:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
so if we do the Medicaid rate increase
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
is this somewhat redundant or some
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
overlap to the system of care money
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
a small amount and that is dependent
 
04:25:59.210 --> 04:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
upon the the child because one child may
 
04:26:01.130 --> 04:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
qualify under Medicaid another may
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
qualify under title for e and other you
 
04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
know may qualify under a different
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
Federal funding source so I would say
 
04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes but it depends and we don't
 
04:26:13.490 --> 04:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily know
 
04:26:16.729 --> 04:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium you know what the
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
the the situations of the children
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
moving into these facilities will be in
 
04:26:22.610 --> 04:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
the coming years and and then I don't
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
know if if what I think I heard you say
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
is that we're just Contracting for it
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
but we're paying for it just like we
 
04:26:31.849 --> 04:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
have in the past except we're using a
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
contract vehicle why isn't this money
 
04:26:35.809 --> 04:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
already in the budget and then I'll come
 
04:26:38.330 --> 04:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
to you representative Waller because we
 
04:26:40.969 --> 04:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
we've we've done the since then because
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
again this was the first time it had
 
04:26:44.030 --> 04:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
ever been done this was an overhaul to
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
the system of care
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
since then we've done the analysis and
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
we've looked at what what is every
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
facilities costs
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
and and this is the rate setting team
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
um that was here previously Christy Roy
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
spearheading that working with cover
 
04:27:00.530 --> 04:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
Leonard our finance director on the
 
04:27:03.050 --> 04:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health side and
 
04:27:05.330 --> 04:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
they've done that analysis and these
 
04:27:07.969 --> 04:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
These are the costs that that would
 
04:27:10.250 --> 04:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
essentially make them closer to whole
 
04:27:13.849 --> 04:27:13.859 align:start position:0%
for the services that they are providing
 
04:27:16.610 --> 04:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative oh I said walner
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just want to count easy
 
04:27:19.319 --> 04:27:20.570 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just want to count easy
question

04:27:20.570 --> 04:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:46.490 --> 04:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
Let's uh let's go to 15 Family Planning
 
04:27:46.500 --> 04:27:48.110 align:start position:0%
Let's uh let's go to 15 Family Planning
there

04:27:48.110 --> 04:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
oh all right I didn't see you
 
04:27:54.649 --> 04:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
so Nathan do we have any idea how many
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
children we're talking about in these
 
04:27:57.359 --> 04:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
children we're talking about in these
lines

04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
I can look it up it'll take me a moment
 
04:28:03.649 --> 04:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
though and and representative Earth just
 
04:28:04.969 --> 04:28:04.979 align:start position:0%
to clarify there are a few other
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
accounting units that that are used to
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
support these contracts again it'll take
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
me a couple of minutes to find that if
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
you'd like that though no no go ahead
 
04:28:15.889 --> 04:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
and answer um representative Wallner it
 
04:28:17.630 --> 04:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
just seems it's down to be up 100 and
 
04:28:25.250 --> 04:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:25.260 --> 04:28:31.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:28:31.210 --> 04:28:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
let's let them come up for air yeah
 
04:28:36.410 --> 04:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
if you look at him accounts for me don't
 
04:28:38.090 --> 04:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
worry about go ahead and take uh
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I'm sorry what was that
 
04:28:44.809 --> 04:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
you don't need to find the accounts for
 
04:28:46.969 --> 04:28:46.979 align:start position:0%
me if that's what you're doing yeah no I
 
04:28:48.410 --> 04:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
was I was just looking up representative
 
04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:36.410 --> 04:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
sure after you get your question your
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
follow-up then representative Moody has
 
04:29:40.729 --> 04:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:29:44.090 --> 04:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you probably for Mr Ripple
 
04:29:44.100 --> 04:29:45.229 align:start position:0%
thank you probably for Mr Ripple
and

04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
with regards to this
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet division three status of
 
04:29:52.370 --> 04:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
actions related to House Bill one
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
is it possible for you to identify which
 
04:29:57.229 --> 04:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
of these are included in the budget and
 
04:30:00.110 --> 04:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
which are outside categorize them by
 
04:30:00.120 --> 04:30:06.530 align:start position:0%
which are outside categorize them by
that

04:30:06.530 --> 04:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
um in what sense so you have
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
you have a number of items such as
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
family planning the prescription drug
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
affordability board the sununu center
 
04:30:16.130 --> 04:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
that are in the budget but at different
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
amounts than those suggested on this
 
04:30:19.080 --> 04:30:20.330 align:start position:0%
amounts than those suggested on this
spreadsheet

04:30:20.330 --> 04:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
04:30:20.340 --> 04:30:21.469 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
okay

04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:23.809 --> 04:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
any others that fall into that category
 
04:30:30.050 --> 04:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
I guess or maybe just point out what's
 
04:30:33.229 --> 04:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
new to the budget on this extensive
 
04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet what would be new to it
 
04:30:36.359 --> 04:30:48.530 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet what would be new to it
um

04:30:48.530 --> 04:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
I look at the prioritized need and some
 
04:30:53.450 --> 04:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
of these were left out of the governor's
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
budget and but we have them here before
 
04:30:58.370 --> 04:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
us initially the prioritized needs are
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
new requests although each of the each
 
04:31:03.410 --> 04:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
of the three programs are currently
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
funded in the operating budget they're
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
just funded at lower levels than the
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:12.840 --> 04:31:14.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:31:14.450 --> 04:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:16.189 --> 04:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
they're all included it's just the
 
04:31:18.050 --> 04:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
funding at this point it has to be
 
04:31:19.729 --> 04:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
discussed on each of these items nothing
 
04:31:27.229 --> 04:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
some of the amounts like home visiting
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
formula grant is exactly the same it
 
04:31:35.689 --> 04:31:35.699 align:start position:0%
prioritize need but was not funded and
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's in this
 
04:31:40.330 --> 04:31:40.340 align:start position:0%
this other sheet at the same amount the
 
04:31:42.889 --> 04:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
525. so that was something the governor
 
04:31:45.530 --> 04:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
left out so it's an addition here
 
04:31:47.630 --> 04:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
I I guess the only thing that I would
 
04:31:47.640 --> 04:31:50.210 align:start position:0%
I I guess the only thing that I would
consider

04:31:50.210 --> 04:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:54.110 --> 04:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
to be newly funded is to be new to this
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
sheet not included in the budget at all
 
04:31:57.889 --> 04:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
is uh representative tolerski's
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the 625 000 per year for
 
04:32:02.689 --> 04:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
the substance use coalition
 
04:32:04.670 --> 04:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
obviously there's other substance use
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
funding in the budget but there's no
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
funding in the for the Coalition in
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
there currently
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay understood and I don't want to take
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
any more time away from representative
 
04:32:15.050 --> 04:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
walner's line of questioning so
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully that commercial break allowed
 
04:32:19.490 --> 04:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
you to find the answer so she can
 
04:32:22.370 --> 04:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
continue thank you sure and and so I I
 
04:32:23.689 --> 04:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
went back and I looked up the original
 
04:32:26.090 --> 04:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
GNC letter from the year prior and and
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
we were at that point estimating about
 
04:32:29.950 --> 04:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
approximately four four to five hundred
 
04:32:34.929 --> 04:32:34.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
and are all of these contracts in all of
 
04:32:38.760 --> 04:32:39.649 align:start position:0%
and are all of these contracts in all of
this

04:32:39.649 --> 04:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:32:42.769 --> 04:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
funding is this all with 24-hour
 
04:32:46.490 --> 04:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
facilities yes yes so these are all
 
04:32:49.849 --> 04:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
residential 24-hour facilities that is
 
04:32:49.859 --> 04:32:50.870 align:start position:0%
residential 24-hour facilities that is
correct

04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
okay so this is probably more of a
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
question for Mr ripsom but
 
04:32:59.570 --> 04:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
without these contracts I mean do you
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
think that we're going to be able to are
 
04:33:05.570 --> 04:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
these providers going to be able
 
04:33:08.990 --> 04:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
to hang on and keep providing service if
 
04:33:09.890 --> 04:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
get these rates up I mean we just saw
 
04:33:16.250 --> 04:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
how much it cost to run sununu I mean
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
these these folks are maybe a little bit
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
maybe the kids are a little less complex
 
04:33:22.561 --> 04:33:25.189 align:start position:0%
maybe the kids are a little less complex
but

04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:33:29.090 --> 04:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's expensive to run a 24-hour facility
 
04:33:29.100 --> 04:33:30.529 align:start position:0%
it's expensive to run a 24-hour facility
and

04:33:30.529 --> 04:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
these these facilities cost less than
 
04:33:35.449 --> 04:33:35.459 align:start position:0%
sununu and these are the kids we're
 
04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
trying to keep out of sunodu
 
04:33:40.730 --> 04:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
so what do you I mean do we have any
 
04:33:43.010 --> 04:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
idea how close I mean are these guys
 
04:33:45.470 --> 04:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
just hanging on by a thread my
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
understanding is that these um these
 
04:33:50.209 --> 04:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
providers are are experiencing the same
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
challenges as many of the other folks
 
04:33:53.449 --> 04:33:53.459 align:start position:0%
that have come here to speak before you
 
04:33:55.369 --> 04:33:55.379 align:start position:0%
over the past number of weeks
 
04:33:58.730 --> 04:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
have we in the last year or two lost any
 
04:34:01.490 --> 04:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
of these type of providers have they
 
04:34:01.500 --> 04:34:04.609 align:start position:0%
of these type of providers have they
closed

04:34:04.609 --> 04:34:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't know the answer to
 
04:34:08.631 --> 04:34:08.641 align:start position:0%
that okay not that I'm aware of okay
 
04:34:10.609 --> 04:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just still not clear how could the
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
budget be off by this much it seems
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
sound like a little bit it's like
 
04:34:15.959 --> 04:34:17.090 align:start position:0%
sound like a little bit it's like
dramatic

04:34:17.090 --> 04:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
well it when when you look at the the
 
04:34:20.879 --> 04:34:22.490 align:start position:0%
well it when when you look at the the
totals

04:34:22.490 --> 04:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
totals
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
um amongst all of the contracts it it's
 
04:34:28.010 --> 04:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
the price the total price limitation is
 
04:34:30.051 --> 04:34:30.061 align:start position:0%
145 million dollars
 
04:34:34.689 --> 04:34:34.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
so it's less than ten percent well so
 
04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
what's the 12 million showing
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
the 12 million so basically were were
 
04:34:45.170 --> 04:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
that to be approved uh we would make
 
04:34:47.570 --> 04:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
amendments and change the rates that we
 
04:34:49.490 --> 04:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
per that we pay those providers and
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
increase their price limitations by the
 
04:34:54.051 --> 04:34:54.061 align:start position:0%
equivalent amount
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
but but the 12 million must represent
 
04:34:58.131 --> 04:34:58.141 align:start position:0%
something in the budget
 
04:35:00.109 --> 04:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
something out of that 143 million is
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
that what you're I mean I'm trying to
 
04:35:02.929 --> 04:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
understand I'm looking at just the
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
numbers right here you got 12 million
 
04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
and you want another yep so so so again
 
04:35:09.650 --> 04:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
what we did is we went back and we we
 
04:35:11.869 --> 04:35:11.879 align:start position:0%
collected cost reports and we looked at
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
what are the actual costs that these
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
providers are incurring and when we did
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
that analysis and looked at every
 
04:35:20.631 --> 04:35:20.641 align:start position:0%
provider and every contract and what
 
04:35:22.250 --> 04:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
rate we should be paying them and we
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
made those adjustments and determined
 
04:35:26.209 --> 04:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
okay if we're going to pay them for
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
those costs we'd have to increase the
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
contracts by X and this is a collective
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
amount okay and solution is basically a
 
04:35:34.369 --> 04:35:34.379 align:start position:0%
10 increase is that what you just told
 
04:35:34.379 --> 04:35:35.209 align:start position:0%
10 increase is that what you just told
me

04:35:35.209 --> 04:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:35:39.250 --> 04:35:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
close to that yeah so it's something to
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
that well no it would be slightly more
 
04:35:45.650 --> 04:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
once you take the general and the
 
04:35:47.570 --> 04:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
federal dollars together 20. but again
 
04:35:51.051 --> 04:35:51.061 align:start position:0%
it depends upon the type of child and
 
04:35:52.970 --> 04:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
whether Federal whether federal dollars
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.051 --> 04:36:00.061 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pause on this because I
 
04:36:02.330 --> 04:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
think we need to caucus but
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
um the family planning on the
 
04:36:09.609 --> 04:36:09.619 align:start position:0%
first page line 15.
 
04:36:12.170 --> 04:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
the Earth Amendment replaced by the
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
Earth Amendment it says this is on hold
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
but um I think I think your amendment
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
was basically actually more of a
 
04:36:24.349 --> 04:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
technical correction
 
04:36:27.949 --> 04:36:27.959 align:start position:0%
right so is there any opposition to
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
approving line 15
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
not on my part any okay so we'll show
 
04:36:38.330 --> 04:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
hands if you're in favor of accepting uh
 
04:36:40.730 --> 04:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
or the accepting the deletion of line
 
04:36:40.740 --> 04:36:43.689 align:start position:0%
or the accepting the deletion of line
15.

04:36:43.689 --> 04:36:43.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.730 --> 04:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
oh that's all right so that's
 
04:36:49.369 --> 04:36:49.379 align:start position:0%
that's good that's one
 
04:36:49.379 --> 04:36:51.170 align:start position:0%
that's good that's one
okay

04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:51.180 --> 04:36:53.449 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:36:53.449 --> 04:36:53.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.650 --> 04:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
let's flip now to the back of the other
 
04:36:57.660 --> 04:36:59.209 align:start position:0%
let's flip now to the back of the other
page

04:36:59.209 --> 04:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh there's a family planning
 
04:37:04.131 --> 04:37:04.141 align:start position:0%
representative Earth Amendment
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
was this also another technique that is
 
04:37:09.890 --> 04:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
this the same technical adjustment
 
04:37:12.590 --> 04:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
s so this was the same thing I had left
 
04:37:14.631 --> 04:37:14.641 align:start position:0%
on under other under other agency
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
requests Family Planning as the
 
04:37:18.529 --> 04:37:18.539 align:start position:0%
department requested it but as Nathan
 
04:37:19.970 --> 04:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
said yesterday that was basically
 
04:37:22.010 --> 04:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
replaced by the Earth Amendment so if
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
you voted on the earth amendment I would
 
04:37:25.609 --> 04:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
which you've already done I would rate
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
both of these out okay so I'm just going
 
04:37:30.170 --> 04:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
to say we're deleting this unless
 
04:37:32.929 --> 04:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
somebody wants another vote as I think
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
what line was that that it's line four
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.689 --> 04:37:44.699 align:start position:0%
okay so the Edwards Amendment on family
 
04:37:48.170 --> 04:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
planning this is the one for a hundred
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
thousand and twenty thousand dollars per
 
04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
new awardee
 
04:37:55.250 --> 04:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
um uh I imagine there's opposition to
 
04:37:55.260 --> 04:37:57.769 align:start position:0%
um uh I imagine there's opposition to
this

04:37:57.769 --> 04:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.929 --> 04:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
I don't really think it's going to work
 
04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
um I would I remove it I would remove it
 
04:38:05.929 --> 04:38:05.939 align:start position:0%
I removed it I did it though I removed
 
04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
it ah
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
just now
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay wow all right all right I still
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a fine Theory
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
um but it's all just Theory and uh I I
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
think I think
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
we just need to finish this
 
04:38:26.810 --> 04:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
so line 45
 
04:38:29.090 --> 04:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
Governor's Commission on alcohol funding
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
I I think we can delete this now because
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
we earlier voted to make sure they get
 
04:38:35.209 --> 04:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
their full five percent
 
04:38:37.970 --> 04:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the benefits was we
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
could delete this yes your earlier vote
 
04:38:43.551 --> 04:38:43.561 align:start position:0%
your earlier vote encompassed this item
 
04:38:45.310 --> 04:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay so 45 is gone
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
45 will be grayed out it's it's it was
 
04:38:52.970 --> 04:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
effectively adopted by your earlier vote
 
04:38:55.490 --> 04:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
Yes okay
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
04:38:58.199 --> 04:39:02.631 align:start position:0%
um and then
um

04:39:02.631 --> 04:39:02.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
so I had another question on 46 for
 
04:39:07.730 --> 04:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky
 
04:39:10.131 --> 04:39:10.141 align:start position:0%
um it's it's kind of there were a couple
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
ambiguous question answers that we went
 
04:39:14.810 --> 04:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
through yesterday and neither of them
 
04:39:17.689 --> 04:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
were particularly critical to me did did
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
you want to did you have an update on
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:22.320 --> 04:39:23.631 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
we can move the question
 
04:39:28.609 --> 04:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
I don't I I don't see it being favorable
 
04:39:31.490 --> 04:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
so we can move along but um I would like
 
04:39:33.529 --> 04:39:33.539 align:start position:0%
to just say you know that I'm a big
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
proponent of prevention
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
prevention is good yep
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
okay but I I had I did have a new
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
question and and I did like the fact
 
04:39:43.440 --> 04:39:45.230 align:start position:0%
question and and I did like the fact
that

04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
this Coalition had a broader Geographic
 
04:39:52.970 --> 04:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
footprint than I initially imagined when
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
I first read it and and so overnight I
 
04:39:58.970 --> 04:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
started thinking well are there other
 
04:40:02.570 --> 04:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
coalitions that are out there that we
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
should be considering for funding too
 
04:40:06.890 --> 04:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
but we happen to know of this Coalition
 
04:40:11.150 --> 04:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.610 --> 04:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
I couldn't answer that I just you know
 
04:40:15.288 --> 04:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
you don't know what you don't know no I
 
04:40:16.368 --> 04:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
don't know what I don't know but I do
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
know that this group has come together
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know with effective programming
 
04:40:25.150 --> 04:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
we we went over this pretty pretty well
 
04:40:28.320 --> 04:40:29.630 align:start position:0%
we we went over this pretty pretty well
yesterday

04:40:29.630 --> 04:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and there was a nice q a on it so
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I would like a show of hands to see
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
who is in favor of 625
 
04:40:43.550 --> 04:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
000 for
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
is before I do that must it be 625
 
04:40:50.630 --> 04:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
000 could we do a lot of good at a lower
 
04:40:50.640 --> 04:40:57.830 align:start position:0%
000 could we do a lot of good at a lower
number

04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
open any funding at this point
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
um with the five I would just say you
 
04:41:04.850 --> 04:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
know it would be divided amongst all
 
04:41:04.860 --> 04:41:07.910 align:start position:0%
know it would be divided amongst all
five

04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:10.610 --> 04:41:10.620 align:start position:0%
I mean I I don't know how that would
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
affect I don't think they would you know
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
say no but this is new money for them
 
04:41:18.288 --> 04:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
this isn't like a continuation of last
 
04:41:20.230 --> 04:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
year's State funding
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
page five of the so-called Monahan
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment you've got several items there
 
04:41:30.770 --> 04:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
under substance use disorder
 
04:41:36.050 --> 04:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.850 --> 04:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
there's a few million dollars there
 
04:41:37.860 --> 04:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
there's a few million dollars there
already

04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
so is your question if we do these rate
 
04:41:46.490 --> 04:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
increases will it benefit this Coalition
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
of five it seems to be double spending
 
04:41:48.840 --> 04:41:51.530 align:start position:0%
of five it seems to be double spending
yes

04:41:51.530 --> 04:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.570 --> 04:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
they're not providers the coalitions are
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
not they're not providers they're
 
04:41:58.970 --> 04:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
educational and training and uh
 
04:42:02.208 --> 04:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
you know community connected prevention
 
04:42:02.218 --> 04:42:04.430 align:start position:0%
you know community connected prevention
okay

04:42:04.430 --> 04:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:13.368 --> 04:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.550 --> 04:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
okay online
 
04:42:18.890 --> 04:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
51 development services budget carry
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
forward and reduce General funds
 
04:42:25.490 --> 04:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
I think those three are done 51 2-3 yep
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
51 52 and 53 were taken care of by your
 
04:42:29.690 --> 04:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
earlier actions today they were all
 
04:42:29.700 --> 04:42:30.890 align:start position:0%
earlier actions today they were all
adopted

04:42:30.890 --> 04:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
04:42:30.900 --> 04:42:37.330 align:start position:0%
adopted
okay

04:42:37.330 --> 04:42:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:37.340 --> 04:42:38.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:40.610 --> 04:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
so what do you have to show us on
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.010 --> 04:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
to represent walner
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't I hate to do this but on line
 
04:42:53.930 --> 04:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
11 Hampstead Hospital operations that is
 
04:42:57.288 --> 04:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
a big that's a pretty sizable
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
um general fund
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
amount that I think
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
I would like to know
 
04:43:05.930 --> 04:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
um what this means to Hampstead Hospital
 
04:43:08.330 --> 04:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
if they don't if they don't get this I
 
04:43:10.128 --> 04:43:10.138 align:start position:0%
mean why
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
I can't remember why we why we had that
 
04:43:14.930 --> 04:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
why that was there
 
04:43:16.730 --> 04:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
and why do I mean we won't be able to do
 
04:43:18.770 --> 04:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
it Hampstead
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
sorry well we did get a briefing on
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampstead and we probably got some one
 
04:43:25.010 --> 04:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
of those coloring books and we got a
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
budget book and all that feels like it
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
was a year ago so so no I but
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
so what would you have us do with this
 
04:43:36.050 --> 04:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
at this point given that we need to move
 
04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
on I would just like to ask Mr White
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
what what this 4.5 million
 
04:43:44.330 --> 04:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
how was that needed by Hampstead what
 
04:43:46.070 --> 04:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
what are they not going to be able to do
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
sure so um out of out of any of the
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
remaining maybe not have any but um in
 
04:43:54.050 --> 04:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
this particular one the governor's
 
04:43:55.970 --> 04:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
budget cut hempstead's general fund
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
portion uh in half
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
um so out of a
 
04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
in in the first year you know we we have
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
a 34 million dollar budget in the second
 
04:44:06.650 --> 04:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
year we have a 29 million dollar budget
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
we're going to be going back out to bid
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
for the well path contract which today
 
04:44:12.650 --> 04:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
for two years it's a 52 million dollar
 
04:44:16.250 --> 04:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
contract based on the revenue and the
 
04:44:18.890 --> 04:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
expenses that I've seen to date we do
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
not have sufficient funds to fund
 
04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
Hampstead in the second year right now
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
if current trends are range true it's
 
04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's a close to 4 million dollar hole
 
04:44:30.770 --> 04:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
out of out of any of these
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
state phase down Professional Care out
 
04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
of any of these other items that one is
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
just a particular concern to me right
 
04:44:36.718 --> 04:44:37.788 align:start position:0%
just a particular concern to me right
now

04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:44:39.770 --> 04:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
the the the first year is actually an
 
04:44:41.208 --> 04:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
error that that there shouldn't be any
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
any costs in the state fiscal year 24
 
04:44:45.948 --> 04:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
here it's just the second year the 4.4
 
04:44:47.270 --> 04:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
million in the general funds in the
 
04:44:51.530 --> 04:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay that one went too fast for me I I I
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
I heard that in 24 the 4.4 that's in
 
04:45:03.230 --> 04:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
there now we don't need that 4.4 and
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
your concern is in the second year
 
04:45:07.850 --> 04:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
and you think we need more money in the
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
second year than the 4.4 that's shown
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
there now yes Hampstead is already
 
04:45:16.730 --> 04:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
proving to generate significant Revenue
 
04:45:18.050 --> 04:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
at a higher rate than New Hampshire
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
hospital just as a point of comparison
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
but to expect that only 10 percent of
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
all of the expenses are generally funded
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
and which I think just some quick about
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
to get back to the envelope map that's
 
04:45:31.970 --> 04:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
what it would come to I I don't think
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's feasible and I don't think we
 
04:45:35.930 --> 04:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
would have sufficient funds my other
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
concern is we have to go back out to bid
 
04:45:42.410 --> 04:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
and and my experience with going back
 
04:45:45.170 --> 04:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
out to bid is it always costs more so
 
04:45:46.448 --> 04:45:46.458 align:start position:0%
what's the number
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
4.4 million dollars I I think in the
 
04:45:51.650 --> 04:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
second year that's what I already see on
 
04:45:53.690 --> 04:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
my sheet here I already see in the
 
04:45:56.090 --> 04:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
second year that there's 4.4 million and
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we've agreed to that in the second
 
04:45:57.840 --> 04:45:59.448 align:start position:0%
that we've agreed to that in the second
year

04:45:59.448 --> 04:45:59.458 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
you haven't agreed to it it's I grade it
 
04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
out because the other day when um the
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee was going through these
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
requests I had no requests from a member
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
to consider this item
 
04:46:13.970 --> 04:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
okay so it could still be it should
 
04:46:15.650 --> 04:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
maybe still be white we still haven't
 
04:46:15.660 --> 04:46:17.810 align:start position:0%
maybe still be white we still haven't
decided

04:46:17.810 --> 04:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
decided
 
04:46:17.820 --> 04:46:19.090 align:start position:0%
decided
okay

04:46:19.090 --> 04:46:19.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:22.730 --> 04:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
it could be okay that's fine I there's
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
just so much detail here uh it's I'm
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
having a little struggle so 0 and 24 and
 
04:46:34.190 --> 04:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
and so 4.4 in the second year and you
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
think that 4.4 is more than the 10
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
percent of their costs and but about
 
04:46:43.730 --> 04:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
right for what we probably need to do in
 
04:46:45.288 --> 04:46:45.298 align:start position:0%
general funds to supplement their
 
04:46:48.050 --> 04:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
revenues the the 4.4 is what was cut
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
during the governor's budget from the
 
04:46:51.288 --> 04:46:51.298 align:start position:0%
agency well actually it was cut more
 
04:46:54.530 --> 04:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
than that but but that I I think if we
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
can get that 4.4 back I would feel a lot
 
04:46:58.850 --> 04:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
better because otherwise otherwise I
 
04:47:01.550 --> 04:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
would fully expect Hampstead to run a
 
04:47:04.850 --> 04:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:07.368 --> 04:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
do you need all 4.4 because it sounds
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
like there's already something in the
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget I am again with
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampstead we don't have a lot of history
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
right the the revenues are looking good
 
04:47:19.970 --> 04:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
I I mean again compared to New Hampshire
 
04:47:19.980 --> 04:47:21.890 align:start position:0%
I I mean again compared to New Hampshire
hospital

04:47:21.890 --> 04:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
um however we are we are going to be
 
04:47:27.288 --> 04:47:27.298 align:start position:0%
implementing the the prtf which will
 
04:47:29.690 --> 04:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
likely decrease the the revenue that we
 
04:47:31.490 --> 04:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
can bring in
 
04:47:34.490 --> 04:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so having that 4.4 million dollars
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
there will provide us with some level of
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
assurance that I in the event we still
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
come up short I don't have to transfer
 
04:47:42.890 --> 04:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
four million dollars from somewhere else
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
to cover that so so your total request
 
04:47:48.170 --> 04:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
for both years is still just the 4.4
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
just the 4.4 do you have any comments on
 
04:47:53.090 --> 04:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
that you open this can of worms thinking
 
04:47:55.550 --> 04:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
we were going to cut money and now it
 
04:47:58.570 --> 04:47:58.580 align:start position:0%
sounds like we just added 4.4
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
it sounds it sounds like it's really
 
04:48:04.250 --> 04:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
important that we address this oh okay
 
04:48:06.890 --> 04:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay I I misunderstood your opening
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
question I thought what you thought I
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to cut it out I thought you were
 
04:48:13.570 --> 04:48:13.580 align:start position:0%
challenging it yes
 
04:48:16.670 --> 04:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so I asked us to go back to it I
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
thought it I thought we I asked this
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
just to go back to it and talk about it
 
04:48:23.208 --> 04:48:23.218 align:start position:0%
no representative Waller what percentage
 
04:48:25.730 --> 04:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
of their uh operations are covered by
 
04:48:25.740 --> 04:48:40.190 align:start position:0%
of their uh operations are covered by
Revenue

04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.930 --> 04:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
because I think when they were private
 
04:48:45.128 --> 04:48:45.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
so a little probably about
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
61 percent was covered
 
04:48:53.570 --> 04:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I I will say though that we have a
 
04:48:55.730 --> 04:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
very different operating model
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
um and the facility also came up for
 
04:48:59.810 --> 04:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
sale so I don't necessarily know if
 
04:49:01.368 --> 04:49:01.378 align:start position:0%
their past history is a good indicator
 
04:49:02.690 --> 04:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
of how we should operate it going
 
04:49:16.128 --> 04:49:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.120 --> 04:49:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
well I would I would propose that we
 
04:49:29.390 --> 04:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
um approve the 4.4 million
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're 20 25. for 2025 in the second
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
year if that addresses Mr White's
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
concerns and thinks that'll
 
04:49:41.930 --> 04:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
keep them in operating in good state in
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
the opposition to The Proposal
 
04:49:46.610 --> 04:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
so I think we're spending more than the
 
04:49:46.620 --> 04:49:49.250 align:start position:0%
so I think we're spending more than the
governor

04:49:49.250 --> 04:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.730 --> 04:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
it it it feels like we might be yes
 
04:49:55.330 --> 04:49:55.340 align:start position:0%
especially when we get to the
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:07.930 --> 04:50:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
so so we we have we have one big lever
 
04:50:14.690 --> 04:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
that we haven't talked about yet but so
 
04:50:18.170 --> 04:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
um so a few are in favor of adding that
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
4.4 in the second year
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:25.320 --> 04:50:27.530 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

04:50:27.530 --> 04:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
04:50:31.128 --> 04:50:31.138 align:start position:0%
all right so it carries can you mark me
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
down as undecided right now yeah if
 
04:50:35.930 --> 04:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
we've already accounted for this per
 
04:50:38.030 --> 04:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
represent or chairman Weiler I'd like to
 
04:50:39.890 --> 04:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
know that I
 
04:50:45.410 --> 04:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:45.420 --> 04:50:46.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:50:46.730 --> 04:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:46.740 --> 04:50:47.530 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:50:47.530 --> 04:50:47.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
work supplemental program on six
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
chairman oh yeah you're going sorry
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're going exactly where I wanted you
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
to go I was going to point out we hadn't
 
04:50:59.690 --> 04:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
done number six yet
 
04:50:59.700 --> 04:51:01.550 align:start position:0%
done number six yet
okay

04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
you had skipped over it and I wanted to
 
04:51:05.448 --> 04:51:05.458 align:start position:0%
bring it back because I'm the person who
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to pull it off and discuss it I
 
04:51:10.368 --> 04:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
skipped it because I I was obsessed with
 
04:51:12.770 --> 04:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
the really huge number it's system of
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
care and I thought if we solved the
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
biggest problem first then these tiny
 
04:51:20.330 --> 04:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.340 --> 04:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:21.600 --> 04:51:22.190 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:24.530 --> 04:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
so was this in a prioritized need the
 
04:51:27.288 --> 04:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
Wix supplemental that was not supported
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
by the governor yes that is correct it
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
was in the agency prioritizing its
 
04:51:30.840 --> 04:51:33.288 align:start position:0%
was in the agency prioritizing its
request

04:51:33.288 --> 04:51:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
and this goes to families with
 
04:51:37.320 --> 04:51:39.530 align:start position:0%
and this goes to families with
like

04:51:39.530 --> 04:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:51:43.368 --> 04:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
under under the uh 70 percent federal
 
04:51:47.090 --> 04:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:50.090 --> 04:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
you don't know uh I in my notes I have
 
04:51:51.650 --> 04:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
provided to low-income families for
 
04:51:52.850 --> 04:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
Redemption at local New Hampshire
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
farmers markets and administration costs
 
04:51:57.288 --> 04:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
associated with administering oh yeah oh
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
the farmer's market yes okay so this is
 
04:52:02.270 --> 04:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
is this is this the same thing as a SNAP
 
04:52:04.550 --> 04:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
benefit that we had negotiated last year
 
04:52:06.770 --> 04:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
and I I think the reason this is on hold
 
04:52:10.010 --> 04:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
is because I asked somebody to go find
 
04:52:14.690 --> 04:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
out what promise I made them last year
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
I I
 
04:52:19.850 --> 04:52:19.860 align:start position:0%
and and Mr Ripple I was going to look it
 
04:52:22.850 --> 04:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
up when we first put this program in
 
04:52:24.948 --> 04:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
play I got to make sure I'm talking
 
04:52:27.230 --> 04:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
about the same program this is the
 
04:52:30.050 --> 04:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
program that was was brand new at the
 
04:52:33.410 --> 04:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
end of last year and this isn't the snap
 
04:52:36.770 --> 04:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
extra Farmers Market benefit this line
 
04:52:38.690 --> 04:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
item is based on a bill that was filed
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
this year yeah
 
04:52:43.490 --> 04:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a new program
 
04:52:45.708 --> 04:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
Sometimes women infant and children so
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
no okay which is different than snap
 
04:52:49.440 --> 04:52:51.410 align:start position:0%
no okay which is different than snap
it's

04:52:51.410 --> 04:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
so we we were awarded a grant in federal
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 and this is the
 
04:53:02.208 --> 04:53:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.730 --> 04:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
only 30 percent
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
04:53:09.490 --> 04:53:09.500 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky would you like
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
us to vote in favor of this
 
04:53:17.090 --> 04:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to explain why I've got
 
04:53:19.850 --> 04:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
this BMI bonnet go ahead and I'll be
 
04:53:19.860 --> 04:53:21.050 align:start position:0%
this BMI bonnet go ahead and I'll be
quick

04:53:21.050 --> 04:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
quick
 
04:53:21.060 --> 04:53:22.070 align:start position:0%
quick
um

04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:23.868 --> 04:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
when we heard
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
um Miss Tilly come and go through these
 
04:53:28.368 --> 04:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
line items this one really hit me hard
 
04:53:32.510 --> 04:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
for the low price tag and for the huge
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
benefit out of it and yesterday when I
 
04:53:35.930 --> 04:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
was driving here I was listening to nhpr
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
and they were talking about the
 
04:53:39.530 --> 04:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing numbers of colorectal
 
04:53:41.930 --> 04:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
cancer cases in
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
um people who are younger
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
primary thing that they talked about to
 
04:53:52.208 --> 04:53:52.218 align:start position:0%
prevent this kind of cancer was healthy
 
04:53:54.890 --> 04:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
Mediterranean eating with high produce
 
04:53:57.770 --> 04:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
and I thought about this bill and I
 
04:53:59.330 --> 04:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
thought about the people who utilize
 
04:54:01.850 --> 04:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
this kind of program their low income
 
04:54:05.150 --> 04:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
they often live in food deserts their
 
04:54:06.590 --> 04:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
primary grocery store is the Dollar
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
Store where there's no fresh produce
 
04:54:11.090 --> 04:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
I also thought about the fact that this
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
bill helps our farms and our local
 
04:54:17.570 --> 04:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
businesses it's a win-win it brings
 
04:54:20.330 --> 04:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
business to our farms and our farms and
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
our farmers markets and it helps
 
04:54:26.448 --> 04:54:26.458 align:start position:0%
Children and Families eat healthy
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
locally grown foods that again is
 
04:54:32.448 --> 04:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
prevention that will save us in the long
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
term when we have a healthy strong
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
community so that is my pitch and I
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
really hope you guys can
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
look at this and representative is going
 
04:54:42.410 --> 04:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
to give me his counter argument which
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for finally listening to me so
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
they live in a food desert with farmers
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
markets nearby and that the putting more
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
money in this is going to change their
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
culture and they're going to eat
 
04:54:52.440 --> 04:54:54.170 align:start position:0%
culture and they're going to eat
healthier

04:54:54.170 --> 04:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
healthier
 
04:54:55.970 --> 04:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
no that's not what I'm saying what Aang
 
04:54:57.650 --> 04:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
is for example again using my own
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
Community our downtown
 
04:55:02.350 --> 04:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
does not have
 
04:55:06.410 --> 04:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
easily accessible uh low priced you know
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
grocery stores a lot of them shop at
 
04:55:10.670 --> 04:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
these Dollar Trees dollar five whatever
 
04:55:13.970 --> 04:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
we do have however a City Farmers Market
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
that is right downtown where these
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
people where the people live and they
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
can go and access this locally fresh
 
04:55:20.878 --> 04:55:22.430 align:start position:0%
can go and access this locally fresh
produce

04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
produce
 
04:55:25.128 --> 04:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
and it's supported by this program
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
all right representative here's my
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
question I I do like your enthusiasm and
 
04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I wish it were
 
04:55:34.670 --> 04:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
there's I wish it were so but what we've
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
been through this several times over the
 
04:55:37.490 --> 04:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
last few years what makes you think
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
these people are motivated to go and buy
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
those because I get the benefits they're
 
04:55:43.010 --> 04:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
totally you're right totally right about
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
that but the people have to go and
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually buy them to get the benefit
 
04:55:47.280 --> 04:55:50.050 align:start position:0%
actually buy them to get the benefit
right

04:55:50.050 --> 04:55:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.850 --> 04:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
I guess I would say what tells you that
 
04:55:55.010 --> 04:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
they won't
 
04:55:57.530 --> 04:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
I thought okay because I haven't yeah I
 
04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
thought because past experience
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
04:56:05.570 --> 04:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
my town has a food program where they
 
04:56:07.850 --> 04:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
put they go and they buy surplus food up
 
04:56:09.410 --> 04:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
at the state and they put it out on a
 
04:56:12.410 --> 04:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
table anybody can come in and and pick
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
it up so I had extra cucumbers and and
 
04:56:18.170 --> 04:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
some other vegetables in my garden I put
 
04:56:19.788 --> 04:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
them on the same table
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
went back three days later
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
to add some more and nobody had taken
 
04:56:27.288 --> 04:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
any of the fresh produce but they take
 
04:56:28.910 --> 04:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
all this stuff and I remember the guy
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
that worked in the in the in the food
 
04:56:34.970 --> 04:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
distribution he said and we looked at
 
04:56:36.650 --> 04:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff he got up at the state
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
and he said if they have to heat it up
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
we'll put it in the oven they don't take
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
it they just want a box they can take an
 
04:56:46.010 --> 04:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
open and give to the kids to eat they
 
04:56:48.170 --> 04:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
don't want to do any kind of work or
 
04:56:49.850 --> 04:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
even heat it in a pan
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the population we're
 
04:56:54.410 --> 04:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
dealing with I think that's excuse me Mr
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
chairman but I think that's somewhat
 
04:57:01.490 --> 04:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.930 --> 04:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
I mean well I think stating that people
 
04:57:04.128 --> 04:57:04.138 align:start position:0%
aren't going to take advantage of the
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
program is not not accurate either as I
 
04:57:08.810 --> 04:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
think the uh the department wouldn't
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
have brought it forth if they didn't
 
04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
think it would be an effective way to
 
04:57:15.050 --> 04:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
promote health
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
so I will support this is there any way
 
04:57:20.330 --> 04:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
you can actually in Europe since this is
 
04:57:22.490 --> 04:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
local to you apparently
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
get some feedback on your own that it's
 
04:57:26.030 --> 04:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
working that people actually are taking
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
I could talk to the legislators who
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
actually drafted the original bill I
 
04:57:34.250 --> 04:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
mean I was not a part of that this
 
04:57:35.690 --> 04:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
literally is just a seed that's been
 
04:57:37.610 --> 04:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
planted in me since we heard this a
 
04:57:39.170 --> 04:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I'm not arguing for this for
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
Nashua I'm just saying giving you the
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
example of our farmers market our
 
04:57:49.128 --> 04:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman our church
 
04:57:53.690 --> 04:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
um in Auburn is in the business of
 
04:57:55.368 --> 04:57:55.378 align:start position:0%
giving away a lot of food some of it
 
04:57:57.288 --> 04:57:57.298 align:start position:0%
comes from the local grocery stores some
 
04:57:59.208 --> 04:57:59.218 align:start position:0%
of it right but they every Saturday
 
04:58:01.070 --> 04:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
morning they open up the facility and
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
they have a line of cars picking up food
 
04:58:07.550 --> 04:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
again Ansel
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
just a single data point not necessarily
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
um conclusive or
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing of causation or correlation
 
04:58:17.400 --> 04:58:19.610 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing of causation or correlation
but

04:58:19.610 --> 04:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
a large box of potatoes isn't treated
 
04:58:24.288 --> 04:58:24.298 align:start position:0%
the same way as a bag of potatoes I
 
04:58:25.970 --> 04:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
don't understand why sometimes the food
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
that comes in comes in in a box of
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
potatoes and they'll leave the box of
 
04:58:31.970 --> 04:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
potatoes but they'll take the stuff
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's either prepared or partially
 
04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
prepared or the smaller units I don't
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
understand why it's just an observation
 
04:58:40.970 --> 04:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
they don't tend to take the healthier
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
types of bread they tend to take the
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
white bread I and I'm not saying I'm not
 
04:58:48.050 --> 04:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
trying to mischaracterize it I I wish
 
04:58:50.330 --> 04:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
people bought healthy food it's
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
important I wish people use just the
 
04:58:53.868 --> 04:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
outer side of the grocery store the ring
 
04:58:55.490 --> 04:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
all the way around this the outside that
 
04:58:56.930 --> 04:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
had Refrigeration which is where the
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
healthier foods tend to be than the Box
 
04:59:00.770 --> 04:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
stuff in the center but
 
04:59:02.930 --> 04:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
up by observation that's not what's
 
04:59:05.448 --> 04:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
happening and it's a societal issue and
 
04:59:06.890 --> 04:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
I wish we could figure out how to fix it
 
04:59:09.530 --> 04:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
so we could continue to talk about it
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
but the key thing I've heard is uh
 
04:59:13.730 --> 04:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative verf is going to vote for
 
04:59:16.128 --> 04:59:16.138 align:start position:0%
it so from a practical matter we have
 
04:59:19.010 --> 04:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
the votes already identified
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
um so so we can just go to a vote but Mr
 
04:59:22.320 --> 04:59:24.070 align:start position:0%
um so so we can just go to a vote but Mr
Ripple

04:59:24.070 --> 04:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
Ripple
 
04:59:27.170 --> 04:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney brings up a good
 
04:59:27.180 --> 04:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney brings up a good
question

04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:59:30.770 --> 04:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
do we have a running checkbook because
 
04:59:33.410 --> 04:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're not really I'm not really sure
 
04:59:35.690 --> 04:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
she's not really sure we're adding money
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
here and there but it feels to me like
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:42.480 --> 04:59:45.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
you have no running total for today's
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
actions I think the other two divisions
 
04:59:51.650 --> 04:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
are in the same boat and I think once
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's done for the day we're going
 
04:59:55.490 --> 04:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
to go back and see where the overall
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
budget is at and provide you with an
 
05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
answer so we if we if we were to say we
 
05:00:02.570 --> 05:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
love this and we vote for it and we find
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
out that we don't have the money we're
 
05:00:05.990 --> 05:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
still going to get one more shot at
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
getting our numbers back in line if we
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
have to I think you will yes whether
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
that's a subsequent division meeting or
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
the full full committee it feels like a
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
full committee at that point but
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:00:20.280 --> 05:00:21.530 align:start position:0%
okay so
right

05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:00:24.730 --> 05:00:24.740 align:start position:0%
I I think some of what we said here was
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
felt a little stereotypical but there
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
was a lot of Truth in it too that within
 
05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
low-income poverty groups there are
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
significant pockets of folks with not
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
good habits bad cultural things and I'm
 
05:00:43.490 --> 05:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
still just thinking that we can put
 
05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
money on something but unless there's
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
some cultural change uh it's only going
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
to go to a select few
 
05:00:53.208 --> 05:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
but um but that's not to paint everyone
 
05:00:55.550 --> 05:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
on the same broad brush it just I think
 
05:00:58.970 --> 05:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
it's just the culture matters so I I
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
would like to act on representative
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
tolerski's request to approve item six
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
at 300 000 a year
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
um if you're in favor of keeping it
 
05:01:15.050 --> 05:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:18.110 --> 05:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed raise your hand
 
05:01:23.208 --> 05:01:23.218 align:start position:0%
okay so that's passes like six to three
 
05:01:24.948 --> 05:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
um that was number six that passed
 
05:01:26.930 --> 05:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
pardon me that was number six that
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
passed that was six we've approved six
 
05:01:29.930 --> 05:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
05:01:31.788 --> 05:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay but you just I think you just
 
05:01:36.410 --> 05:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
killed uh representative wallner's uh
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.770 --> 05:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
too bad so so let's bring up number five
 
05:01:45.780 --> 05:01:47.270 align:start position:0%
too bad so so let's bring up number five
um

05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm gonna I'm gonna have a caucus on
 
05:01:49.680 --> 05:01:55.750 align:start position:0%
I I'm gonna I'm gonna have a caucus on
this

05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
did we we need to show the back of the
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
budget because that's going to be the
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
so there was a version that I handed out
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I think I have
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
I think I have spare copies of that if
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
not I can print some out there's an
 
05:02:14.570 --> 05:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
updated version in the works but I don't
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
yet have it back
 
05:02:18.050 --> 05:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
and that was based on representative
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right then I know what it
 
05:02:25.138 --> 05:02:28.128 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right then I know what it
is

05:02:28.128 --> 05:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.448 --> 05:02:32.458 align:start position:0%
I I am gonna go see if uh representative
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
felishman can join us
 
05:02:38.448 --> 05:02:38.458 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be away do you do you I
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's anything there you
 
05:02:42.288 --> 05:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
can have us talk about five-minute
 
05:02:42.298 --> 05:11:46.270 align:start position:0%
can have us talk about five-minute
recess

05:11:46.270 --> 05:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:54.410 --> 05:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
that was my nice way to say
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.420 --> 05:12:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:12:15.890 --> 05:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna bring us out of recess and um
 
05:12:23.930 --> 05:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
want to start on
 
05:12:25.750 --> 05:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
item 27
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
of the status of actions related hb1
 
05:12:32.330 --> 05:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
only the chairman of division one who's
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
extremely busy and was able to find a
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
few minutes to come chat with us
 
05:12:40.490 --> 05:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
so uh representative leishman would you
 
05:12:42.530 --> 05:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
would you you've you've seen this
 
05:12:44.448 --> 05:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
amendment you and I have been
 
05:12:48.170 --> 05:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
working on this issue together for quite
 
05:12:50.030 --> 05:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
a while now I don't even know I think we
 
05:12:52.730 --> 05:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
started about a year ago when we saw
 
05:12:55.070 --> 05:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
this in the fiscal committee and started
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
digging into it but go ahead and tell us
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
what you want to tell us thank you Mr
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and seeing Mr White next to me
 
05:13:04.550 --> 05:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
I've even had conversations about this
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
particular board with Mr White so this
 
05:13:09.650 --> 05:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
um so for the record my name is Peter
 
05:13:12.770 --> 05:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
leishman I represent Peterborough and
 
05:13:12.780 --> 05:13:14.208 align:start position:0%

Sharon

05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:14.218 align:start position:0%
Sharon
 
05:13:16.730 --> 05:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
so the prescription drug affordability
 
05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
board first came to my attention sitting
 
05:13:21.650 --> 05:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal committee about a year and
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
a half or maybe even two years ago
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
they initially came in for a request for
 
05:13:28.868 --> 05:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
about four hundred thousand dollars
 
05:13:31.368 --> 05:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
I had never heard of the prescription
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board until he
 
05:13:35.208 --> 05:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
appeared before fiscal and apparently
 
05:13:38.510 --> 05:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
this board was established through a an
 
05:13:41.150 --> 05:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill it didn't have the review
 
05:13:43.850 --> 05:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
that normal bills get from the policy
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee it never came to finance
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
so I started watching their meetings on
 
05:13:51.410 --> 05:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
YouTube I actually attended one of their
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
meetings and I was quite concerned to
 
05:13:53.280 --> 05:13:54.110 align:start position:0%
meetings and I was quite concerned to
find

05:13:54.110 --> 05:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
find
 
05:13:56.208 --> 05:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
that they had a great deal of authority
 
05:13:59.390 --> 05:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
to impose fees impose fines and had
 
05:14:00.770 --> 05:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
never gone through the legislative
 
05:14:03.830 --> 05:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
process so representative Edwards and I
 
05:14:06.708 --> 05:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
are both serving on the fiscal committee
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
developed the mutual concern how this
 
05:14:12.470 --> 05:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
board developed and what lack of control
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
they had so that is I believe led to
 
05:14:18.550 --> 05:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment that I'm supporting
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards may be able to
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
speak in addition to what I've added but
 
05:14:26.208 --> 05:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
there is some duplication that we have
 
05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
learned by the insurance department the
 
05:14:32.750 --> 05:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services so
 
05:14:35.570 --> 05:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
perhaps if the board had had the normal
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
oversight in review that other boards
 
05:14:40.670 --> 05:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
and commissions have had I wouldn't be
 
05:14:42.650 --> 05:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
sitting here so that's I guess what I
 
05:14:44.208 --> 05:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
have Mr chairman thanks for the
 
05:14:45.650 --> 05:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
05:14:47.090 --> 05:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
do you have time for a few questions
 
05:14:47.100 --> 05:14:49.850 align:start position:0%
do you have time for a few questions
sure

05:14:49.850 --> 05:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:14:54.050 --> 05:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
um I I think you I think you said it
 
05:14:54.060 --> 05:14:55.190 align:start position:0%
um I I think you I think you said it
that

05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
um uh that they have the power to tax
 
05:15:00.410 --> 05:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
they can impose work requirements on the
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
private sector they can go out and
 
05:15:03.000 --> 05:15:04.810 align:start position:0%
private sector they can go out and
contract

05:15:04.810 --> 05:15:04.820 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:15:07.550 --> 05:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
independently without any oversight
 
05:15:10.010 --> 05:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
there's no nothing in the statute to
 
05:15:12.410 --> 05:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
suggest they have to go through the
 
05:15:14.570 --> 05:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
ordinary contract process and then and
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
then they can Levy fines the ability to
 
05:15:19.788 --> 05:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
level Levy finds has me particularly
 
05:15:23.090 --> 05:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
concerned because without any oversight
 
05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
checks and balances is kind of an
 
05:15:27.530 --> 05:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
autonomous board they have the power to
 
05:15:30.530 --> 05:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
demand information from the private
 
05:15:34.490 --> 05:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
sector and uh and if and and and there's
 
05:15:37.570 --> 05:15:37.580 align:start position:0%
nothing in the statute that that
 
05:15:40.610 --> 05:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
denotes what a reasonable demand is from
 
05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
an unreasonable demand they can
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
basically demand any information that
 
05:15:46.850 --> 05:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
they want on any timeline that they want
 
05:15:49.490 --> 05:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that if those
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
require quests don't get satisfied the
 
05:15:57.230 --> 05:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
section 10 of this stats statute gives
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
them the ability to Levy fines of up to
 
05:16:02.090 --> 05:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars a day for a total of
 
05:16:05.090 --> 05:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand is do you think
 
05:16:07.128 --> 05:16:07.138 align:start position:0%
that that's accurate and and do you
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
share my concern about this ability to
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
essentially legislate on the Fly and and
 
05:16:15.288 --> 05:16:15.298 align:start position:0%
issue fines
 
05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
and and not only that do I support that
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
concern but I attended one of their
 
05:16:21.170 --> 05:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
meetings when they had already announced
 
05:16:23.090 --> 05:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
that they were sending out bills to
 
05:16:24.590 --> 05:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
people and there was a representative
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
there from the Department of Health and
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
Human Services where the money was to
 
05:16:31.490 --> 05:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
come and yet there was no request for a
 
05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
proposal to have the Department of
 
05:16:36.050 --> 05:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to collect
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
those fees or fines so just a lot of
 
05:16:40.970 --> 05:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
moving Parts here and it it's something
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
that deserves the light of day in my
 
05:16:42.718 --> 05:16:45.530 align:start position:0%
that deserves the light of day in my
opinion

05:16:45.530 --> 05:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:47.570 --> 05:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
and then I think you're familiar with
 
05:16:50.090 --> 05:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
the gel car Hearing in which
 
05:16:53.090 --> 05:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
um they they took a look at uh the what
 
05:16:55.368 --> 05:16:55.378 align:start position:0%
was referred to in the statute as the
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
fees structure and gel car I think it
 
05:17:00.110 --> 05:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
was unanimous to include our own
 
05:17:03.708 --> 05:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative hatch on our committee uh
 
05:17:06.650 --> 05:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
made the observation that the the
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
structure that was in the statute is not
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
a fee structure it's a tax structure is
 
05:17:13.610 --> 05:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
is that is that accurate
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
well representative hatch was like
 
05:17:19.090 --> 05:17:19.100 align:start position:0%
recall from looking at the
 
05:17:22.128 --> 05:17:22.138 align:start position:0%
YouTube video was quite concerned what
 
05:17:24.070 --> 05:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
was being proposed
 
05:17:26.510 --> 05:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they were taking on
 
05:17:29.330 --> 05:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
the authority to again Levy taxes fees
 
05:17:32.330 --> 05:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
and fines and had proposed doing that
 
05:17:34.368 --> 05:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
without their rules being approved
 
05:17:38.448 --> 05:17:38.458 align:start position:0%
officially by the rules commit gel car
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on this
 
05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
um all right because I I would like to
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
move that we accept Amendment 1088
 
05:17:53.448 --> 05:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
uh as an hb2 item is there any comment
 
05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
or uh opposition
 
05:17:58.810 --> 05:17:58.820 align:start position:0%
chairman of the uh of the board
 
05:18:02.030 --> 05:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant is here and I
 
05:18:04.250 --> 05:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
think I I would like to hear him
 
05:18:06.170 --> 05:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
what he has to say about some of the
 
05:18:09.610 --> 05:18:09.620 align:start position:0%
things that were just said all right uh
 
05:18:12.110 --> 05:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for taking the time out
 
05:18:13.448 --> 05:18:13.458 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:26.330 --> 05:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman my mother be proud of you
 
05:18:28.368 --> 05:18:28.378 align:start position:0%
who she's Canadian
 
05:18:30.770 --> 05:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
foreign first of all I want to say thank
 
05:18:32.208 --> 05:18:32.218 align:start position:0%
you to the chair and also to the
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to speak today
 
05:18:35.040 --> 05:18:35.930 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to speak today
um

05:18:35.930 --> 05:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:38.030 --> 05:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of things one is I went back
 
05:18:40.070 --> 05:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
and looked at the transcript of gel car
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
that day
 
05:18:43.788 --> 05:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
and in the transcript
 
05:18:43.798 --> 05:18:45.288 align:start position:0%
and in the transcript
was

05:18:45.288 --> 05:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
a comment from Judge Lynn who's now
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
05:18:51.948 --> 05:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
and talked about the fact is that we
 
05:18:51.958 --> 05:18:53.390 align:start position:0%
and talked about the fact is that we
have

05:18:53.390 --> 05:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:18:55.610 --> 05:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
an issue as far as the constitutionality
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the fee but it's a constitutional
 
05:19:01.788 --> 05:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
decision it was not up to the jail card
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
to make a ruling on that but basically
 
05:19:07.010 --> 05:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
to bring it to people's attention there
 
05:19:09.650 --> 05:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
was a concern it wasn't basically saying
 
05:19:12.650 --> 05:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
that it was in fact unconstitutional
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
and that's coming directly from the
 
05:19:16.788 --> 05:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
transcript from representative Lynn
 
05:19:19.250 --> 05:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
if you look at also where the board is
 
05:19:19.260 --> 05:19:20.750 align:start position:0%
if you look at also where the board is
today

05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:19:22.610 --> 05:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'll bring a couple comments which I
 
05:19:24.770 --> 05:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
heard last Friday which caught my
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
attention I think caught all of us or
 
05:19:26.878 --> 05:19:28.310 align:start position:0%
attention I think caught all of us or
should

05:19:28.310 --> 05:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
should
 
05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is now
 
05:19:29.700 --> 05:19:30.890 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is now
spending

05:19:30.890 --> 05:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
spending
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
per year
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
290 million dollars for prescription
 
05:19:34.680 --> 05:19:36.650 align:start position:0%
290 million dollars for prescription
drugs

05:19:36.650 --> 05:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
05:19:38.810 --> 05:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
let that sink in 290 million dollars
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's approaching 20 percent of the
 
05:19:40.560 --> 05:19:42.050 align:start position:0%
it's approaching 20 percent of the
budget

05:19:42.050 --> 05:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a mechanism in place
 
05:19:46.128 --> 05:19:46.138 align:start position:0%
at this point in time to try to as a
 
05:19:46.138 --> 05:19:47.090 align:start position:0%
at this point in time to try to as a
state

05:19:47.090 --> 05:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:19:49.850 --> 05:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
bring some sort of control over that or
 
05:19:51.890 --> 05:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
at least try to bring the cost down
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's only what we pay through Medicaid
 
05:19:57.890 --> 05:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include state employees it
 
05:20:02.330 --> 05:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
does not include counties cities towns
 
05:20:05.448 --> 05:20:05.458 align:start position:0%
and also school districts
 
05:20:08.330 --> 05:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
remember that those
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
or in those positions of funded through
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers dollars so if we're serious
 
05:20:16.190 --> 05:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
about reducing the burden to the
 
05:20:16.200 --> 05:20:17.510 align:start position:0%
about reducing the burden to the
taxpayer

05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
then we should be thinking about
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
how to bring down the overall cost of
 
05:20:22.200 --> 05:20:24.230 align:start position:0%
how to bring down the overall cost of
drugs

05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
05:20:26.690 --> 05:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
I've heard from people saying
 
05:20:28.490 --> 05:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
this may not work
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it may not
 
05:20:33.050 --> 05:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
but if we don't try
 
05:20:35.570 --> 05:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
we won't get there either
 
05:20:37.730 --> 05:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
so when you think about a 290 million
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
dollar budget that we're spending as a
 
05:20:39.240 --> 05:20:40.430 align:start position:0%
dollar budget that we're spending as a
state

05:20:40.430 --> 05:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:20:42.530 --> 05:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
four hundred fifty thousand dollars is a
 
05:20:44.810 --> 05:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
drop in the bucket
 
05:20:47.570 --> 05:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
and what I'm trying to say at this point
 
05:20:50.930 --> 05:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
in time is with all the state agencies
 
05:20:52.970 --> 05:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
why don't we find a way to work
 
05:20:55.010 --> 05:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
collectively with the other ones we've
 
05:20:56.270 --> 05:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
talked about redundancy I don't think
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's redundancy completely but finding a
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
way to take and pull together all the
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
resources in our state we're uniquely
 
05:21:03.240 --> 05:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
resources in our state we're uniquely
qualified

05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
05:21:07.070 --> 05:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
because we are a small state we can work
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
together collectively that's the granite
 
05:21:11.570 --> 05:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
way we roll up our sleaze and we work
 
05:21:13.610 --> 05:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
together collectively for the benefit of
 
05:21:14.810 --> 05:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
and what the board is uniquely qualified
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
to do is to pull together the resources
 
05:21:21.708 --> 05:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
of the state to accomplish that
 
05:21:25.550 --> 05:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
so when you think about Commerce 2 in
 
05:21:27.410 --> 05:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
Commerce there was two bills introduced
 
05:21:30.890 --> 05:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 130 to repeal the board and
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 172.
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
that was to talk about redundancy
 
05:21:39.230 --> 05:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
and also talking about putting the board
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
or suspending it for a period of time
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
until the report came out
 
05:21:45.170 --> 05:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
both of those bills
 
05:21:47.330 --> 05:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
house bill 30.
 
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
was voted 17-0 to retain it
 
05:21:52.610 --> 05:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
no one that I heard in that transcript
 
05:21:55.850 --> 05:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
during that meeting talked about
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
the board itself as far as the mission
 
05:21:59.090 --> 05:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
of the board
 
05:22:01.010 --> 05:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
there was concerns about the funding of
 
05:22:02.448 --> 05:22:02.458 align:start position:0%
the board and some of the things we
 
05:22:04.670 --> 05:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
05:22:07.368 --> 05:22:07.378 align:start position:0%
in the committee and I testified at the
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee and I'll do it again with you
 
05:22:10.550 --> 05:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
folks here today
 
05:22:12.288 --> 05:22:12.298 align:start position:0%
I'll be willing to work with anyone to
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
fix the legislative issues I'm not
 
05:22:16.970 --> 05:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
saying there isn't issues out there
 
05:22:19.610 --> 05:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
but let's work together to solve the
 
05:22:21.948 --> 05:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
problem through a stakeholder committee
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
meeting and do it that way so are you
 
05:22:28.250 --> 05:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
aware that um the the amendment here uh
 
05:22:30.590 --> 05:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
refers to the insurance department
 
05:22:33.890 --> 05:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
redundancy elimination report that the
 
05:22:34.970 --> 05:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
department of insurance and
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the prescription drug
 
05:22:39.410 --> 05:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
affordability board shall issue a report
 
05:22:41.090 --> 05:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
on the elimination of redundancies
 
05:22:43.128 --> 05:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
related to The Collection analysis and
 
05:22:44.930 --> 05:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
Reporting on prescription drug prices
 
05:22:47.810 --> 05:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
between the two organizations including
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation on such elimination
 
05:22:52.730 --> 05:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
with the overarching goal of promoting
 
05:22:55.310 --> 05:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency in economy this report will
 
05:22:58.070 --> 05:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
be submitted to HHS oversight the
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House the president
 
05:23:01.628 --> 05:23:01.638 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house Clerk and governor
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
no later than October 124. so it seems
 
05:23:07.970 --> 05:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
to me like we're in agreement we're in
 
05:23:09.650 --> 05:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
agreement in some ways representative
 
05:23:13.010 --> 05:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
Edwards in a sense that we talked about
 
05:23:15.410 --> 05:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
that in the Commerce Committee about
 
05:23:18.650 --> 05:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
pulling together as stakeholder group to
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
talk about what we can do to address the
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised about
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
redundancy and about how we fund it and
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
I totally support pulling together
 
05:23:28.190 --> 05:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholder community
 
05:23:31.610 --> 05:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of all of us in to your
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
point let's think it through slow it
 
05:23:37.250 --> 05:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
down and do it right and not do it fast
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's what this amendment does
 
05:23:41.810 --> 05:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
and it and it clarifies the the
 
05:23:43.610 --> 05:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issue on the tax
 
05:23:46.430 --> 05:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
structure of the of the board by saying
 
05:23:48.170 --> 05:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
the funding will be General funds that
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the Constitutional issue
 
05:23:53.230 --> 05:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
altogether and it also allows for
 
05:23:56.570 --> 05:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
voluntary donations and contributions to
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
the board over and above what the state
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
general funding could be it does um I
 
05:24:04.190 --> 05:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
just want to bring it to the attention
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:24:07.390 --> 05:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
committee and I want to say
 
05:24:09.530 --> 05:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative Alicia was correct way
 
05:24:11.570 --> 05:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
back in the finance committee we went to
 
05:24:13.128 --> 05:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
the finance committee joint finance
 
05:24:15.890 --> 05:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
committee asking for funds and he was
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely right we didn't have rules in
 
05:24:20.930 --> 05:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
place and we heard him and we responded
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
and we spent the whole year developing
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
rules to put that in place one of the
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
things that gel Carr asked when we were
 
05:24:30.170 --> 05:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
going through rulemaking there's no
 
05:24:33.050 --> 05:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
rules in there to accept gifts so at
 
05:24:34.550 --> 05:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
this point in time even though it may be
 
05:24:35.990 --> 05:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
in statute we don't have anything in
 
05:24:37.850 --> 05:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
rules in order for us to accept the
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
gifts if that was so desired
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:24:45.010 --> 05:24:45.020 align:start position:0%
um are there other questions
 
05:24:47.930 --> 05:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
05:24:47.940 --> 05:24:49.430 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
yes

05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:24:51.170 --> 05:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative can you point to any
 
05:24:55.610 --> 05:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
savings that the board has had result
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
of being in place
 
05:25:00.530 --> 05:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
I wish I could representative Weller the
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
board has been challenged with a lack of
 
05:25:03.890 --> 05:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
resources we've been spending a lot of
 
05:25:05.810 --> 05:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
our time working on rules which were
 
05:25:07.490 --> 05:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
required by The Joint fiscal committee
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time trying to at this
 
05:25:11.930 --> 05:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
point in time get an mou through the
 
05:25:14.030 --> 05:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
process so we have been trying to build
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure that we need in order
 
05:25:18.410 --> 05:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
to show the results
 
05:25:19.610 --> 05:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of where we are today
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up do you know if we still get
 
05:25:24.410 --> 05:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
rebates from the big pharmas
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
I would love to answer that question I
 
05:25:27.230 --> 05:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't know but that's one of the things
 
05:25:28.490 --> 05:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think the board's trying to understand
 
05:25:31.250 --> 05:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
is where the money's going I
 
05:25:33.170 --> 05:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
at one point we'll be getting as much as
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
20 million in rebates from some of the
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
as you say we spend hundreds of millions
 
05:25:40.368 --> 05:25:40.378 align:start position:0%
in in Pharmacy for all the people that
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
we provide medication to so we were
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes getting some pretty big
 
05:25:44.638 --> 05:25:46.190 align:start position:0%
sometimes getting some pretty big
rebates

05:25:46.190 --> 05:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
rebates
 
05:25:48.110 --> 05:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
there was and also just to bring it to
 
05:25:49.610 --> 05:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
your attention you may not be aware of
 
05:25:52.730 --> 05:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
this but the centene which is one of the
 
05:25:55.128 --> 05:25:55.138 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations that we are
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
working with in the state of New
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has now decided to pull out of
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
the drug business and rationale toys
 
05:26:02.990 --> 05:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
because they basically got caught with
 
05:26:05.390 --> 05:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
the hand of the cookie jar
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
um they put aside nationally 1.25
 
05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and so far they've paid
 
05:26:13.368 --> 05:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
back to Stage 750 million
 
05:26:15.470 --> 05:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
so in the state of New Hampshire did
 
05:26:17.510 --> 05:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
collect some money on that as well
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
um I was just saying is that should not
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
have happened the reason that why it
 
05:26:23.330 --> 05:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
happened was a colleague of mine in the
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
state of Ohio working the same capacity
 
05:26:27.470 --> 05:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
in a sense not per se where the
 
05:26:28.490 --> 05:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability report
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
but working on this issue uncovered the
 
05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
issues that were going on and brought
 
05:26:35.330 --> 05:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
the people's attention and it's now gone
 
05:26:37.550 --> 05:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
National and that's all because somebody
 
05:26:40.550 --> 05:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
took the time to look under the hood and
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
try to find out what was going on
 
05:26:45.770 --> 05:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
we made good use of the fine money can I
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
take 450 000 please
 
05:26:52.368 --> 05:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
so so I follow up on your your question
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
about uh demonstrated savings there
 
05:26:57.050 --> 05:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
there I think there were two states that
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
basically implemented the same model
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
legislation at the same time Maine and
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and all the reports from
 
05:27:05.330 --> 05:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
Maine indicate that they're struggling
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
and they're not having much success
 
05:27:09.650 --> 05:27:09.660 align:start position:0%
getting their program established and
 
05:27:11.690 --> 05:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
and really working
 
05:27:14.810 --> 05:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
so that that is correct chairman Edwards
 
05:27:16.368 --> 05:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
International that they're running into
 
05:27:18.170 --> 05:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
the state has not funded their
 
05:27:20.448 --> 05:27:20.458 align:start position:0%
organization of that program either
 
05:27:26.270 --> 05:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:28.128 --> 05:27:28.138 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
so representative Merchant
 
05:27:32.930 --> 05:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
all of the work that's gone on in the
 
05:27:32.940 --> 05:27:33.890 align:start position:0%
all of the work that's gone on in the
last

05:27:33.890 --> 05:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years with this board has all
 
05:27:39.288 --> 05:27:39.298 align:start position:0%
been voluntary is that my understanding
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's 100 voluntary we have been
 
05:27:44.930 --> 05:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
fortunate to some degree working with
 
05:27:46.128 --> 05:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health Human Services
 
05:27:47.690 --> 05:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
they've been gracious enough to help
 
05:27:49.730 --> 05:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
with some of the administrative
 
05:27:51.470 --> 05:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
functions but it's been for the most
 
05:27:54.530 --> 05:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
part the board itself all voluntary work
 
05:27:58.730 --> 05:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
including all of the clerical work and a
 
05:28:00.288 --> 05:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
lot of the work that's being done you're
 
05:28:03.230 --> 05:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:11.810 --> 05:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
but to this point I hope uh you should
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:28:16.368 --> 05:28:16.378 align:start position:0%
um rather than trying to kill this
 
05:28:18.650 --> 05:28:18.660 align:start position:0%
um the this amendment allows it to
 
05:28:21.230 --> 05:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
continue it allows you to go get
 
05:28:24.288 --> 05:28:24.298 align:start position:0%
Contract support in the old days I
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
called them personal services contracts
 
05:28:29.930 --> 05:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
essentially you know an employee to work
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
for you to do a lot of the work that
 
05:28:35.868 --> 05:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
you've been doing on your own so there
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
is Manpower in here and there is other
 
05:28:39.890 --> 05:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
expenses and it's all getting paid for
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
by the general funds on the belief that
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
we all share the same objective we would
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
like to find a way to get a good lever
 
05:28:49.910 --> 05:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
through the use and exploitation of
 
05:28:51.830 --> 05:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
information to help drive a more
 
05:28:53.868 --> 05:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
competitive market I think the objective
 
05:28:57.050 --> 05:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
is the same the issue is just that I've
 
05:29:00.050 --> 05:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
been worried about is just having it uh
 
05:29:04.430 --> 05:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
done in a way in which our our own state
 
05:29:06.368 --> 05:29:06.378 align:start position:0%
government processes
 
05:29:10.250 --> 05:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
respect the checks and balances expected
 
05:29:13.010 --> 05:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
of government and operate with the
 
05:29:15.170 --> 05:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
transparency and the and and the checks
 
05:29:17.448 --> 05:29:17.458 align:start position:0%
and balances that it should so so I
 
05:29:20.208 --> 05:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
think we share a lot in common uh with
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
the way we view this but I I haven't
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
worked it like you have so I have
 
05:29:25.680 --> 05:29:26.350 align:start position:0%
worked it like you have so I have
um

05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:29.330 --> 05:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
I'm less committed to the program than
 
05:29:32.208 --> 05:29:32.218 align:start position:0%
you are as it makes sense thank you for
 
05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman I'll say this
 
05:29:37.070 --> 05:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
I have worked in a space for over 30
 
05:29:39.890 --> 05:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
years it is very complicated it's very
 
05:29:42.590 --> 05:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
complex it is a lot of disincentives
 
05:29:44.690 --> 05:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
along the way that people don't really
 
05:29:46.730 --> 05:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
understand unless you're in the space my
 
05:29:49.368 --> 05:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
whole goal here is to bring greater
 
05:29:51.530 --> 05:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
transparency to the marketplace to allow
 
05:29:53.208 --> 05:29:53.218 align:start position:0%
the people who are buying prescription
 
05:29:55.910 --> 05:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
drug benefit programs to understand some
 
05:29:57.410 --> 05:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
of the things that are going on in the
 
05:29:58.850 --> 05:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
market so they can become a better
 
05:30:01.730 --> 05:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
stewards of how they spend the money in
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
regards to looking at a contract
 
05:30:05.330 --> 05:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
employee I see this here in the language
 
05:30:08.690 --> 05:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in my opinion of all my
 
05:30:10.250 --> 05:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
years working
 
05:30:12.350 --> 05:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
contract employees are nice but they
 
05:30:13.730 --> 05:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
don't end up
 
05:30:16.010 --> 05:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
costing more money ultimately than
 
05:30:17.570 --> 05:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
employees themselves we've talked about
 
05:30:19.490 --> 05:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
this before I think representative
 
05:30:21.410 --> 05:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
Weiler you brought it up people from
 
05:30:24.050 --> 05:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock if you're contracted how much
 
05:30:26.090 --> 05:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
are you actually invested in the process
 
05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
versus being under contract
 
05:30:30.110 --> 05:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and I have
 
05:30:32.270 --> 05:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
no from my times together when you have
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
somebody who's actually working for
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
who's invested in a program the way they
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
approach things and how they take on the
 
05:30:39.170 --> 05:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
passion for their job is totally
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
different than somebody sometimes under
 
05:30:40.440 --> 05:30:42.530 align:start position:0%
different than somebody sometimes under
contract

05:30:42.530 --> 05:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:30:45.890 --> 05:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative you have a question I was
 
05:30:47.448 --> 05:30:47.458 align:start position:0%
going to summarize what I heard because
 
05:30:49.128 --> 05:30:49.138 align:start position:0%
I I think there's part of this it's
 
05:30:52.430 --> 05:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
Finance but part of this was also rules
 
05:30:54.770 --> 05:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if the current
 
05:30:57.050 --> 05:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
amendment is clear enough regarding
 
05:30:59.628 --> 05:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
making sure rules are in place
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we might need to tweak it for that
 
05:31:05.628 --> 05:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm if representative Merchant can
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
answer yes because if in order for us to
 
05:31:08.400 --> 05:31:09.410 align:start position:0%
answer yes because if in order for us to
receive

05:31:09.410 --> 05:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
receive
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
grants or funds outside of the general
 
05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
treasury we're going to have to have
 
05:31:17.330 --> 05:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
rules according to gel cart so that's
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things again rulemaking is a
 
05:31:22.550 --> 05:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
long process it's arduous at times for
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
those who've been on gel car it's nice
 
05:31:26.330 --> 05:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of transparency in
 
05:31:28.970 --> 05:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
the process but it does take time so I
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to rely upon grants coming in
 
05:31:32.690 --> 05:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
to help fund the board because the
 
05:31:34.190 --> 05:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
likelihood of that happening over the
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
next 12 months is relatively you know
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes so but but why isn't the the rule
 
05:31:41.330 --> 05:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
making in here because the rule making
 
05:31:43.970 --> 05:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
is in the underlying statute and I'm not
 
05:31:46.910 --> 05:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
changing that oh no and they have over a
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
year working on the rules already so
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead could we not just give them the
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
ability via statute to receive funds to
 
05:31:59.330 --> 05:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
this organization I don't see that's
 
05:32:01.070 --> 05:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does it does two
 
05:32:03.170 --> 05:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
things it converts the the their tax
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
structure to a uh General funds and it
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
opens up an account because we heard new
 
05:32:12.830 --> 05:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
Futures in AARP say they had such strong
 
05:32:14.930 --> 05:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
support for this program that they
 
05:32:16.970 --> 05:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
thought it ought to be funded so we gave
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
them a vehicle to contribute to this
 
05:32:22.970 --> 05:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
effort so so the the the funds that the
 
05:32:25.128 --> 05:32:25.138 align:start position:0%
general fund would is just sort of the
 
05:32:28.250 --> 05:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
minimum bid and then those organizations
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
that X that voice such strong support
 
05:32:33.288 --> 05:32:33.298 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to contribute to the
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
effort lines 10 and 11. voluntary
 
05:32:40.368 --> 05:32:40.378 align:start position:0%
contributions correct but again I want
 
05:32:42.770 --> 05:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
to point out that in order for that to
 
05:32:45.050 --> 05:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
happen it does require rulemaking that's
 
05:32:47.628 --> 05:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
what gel cart told us so therefore in
 
05:32:49.550 --> 05:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
order for us from a financial point of
 
05:32:52.010 --> 05:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
view to to begin to even consider taking
 
05:32:54.050 --> 05:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
those monies into the coffers to help
 
05:32:55.850 --> 05:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
the board you're looking at at least the
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
12-month period of time so when you're
 
05:33:00.050 --> 05:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
looking at funding the first year will
 
05:33:01.730 --> 05:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
not have any grants coming into it until
 
05:33:04.610 --> 05:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
we get through rulemaking
 
05:33:07.850 --> 05:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Waller
 
05:33:10.190 --> 05:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
when I look at this and I I'm looking at
 
05:33:12.110 --> 05:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
I guess the budget that was in the
 
05:33:15.050 --> 05:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
governor's budget the budget that was in
 
05:33:16.368 --> 05:33:16.378 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget and then I'm
 
05:33:19.310 --> 05:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
looking at what the board adopted and
 
05:33:22.190 --> 05:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
now I'm looking at a very skinny budget
 
05:33:26.090 --> 05:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
of seventy five thousand dollars and
 
05:33:28.850 --> 05:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
the contract services are sixty thousand
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and I'm just wondering
 
05:33:33.830 --> 05:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
what kind of I mean this feels like to
 
05:33:36.050 --> 05:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
me I don't know a lot about it but
 
05:33:38.510 --> 05:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
it feels like to me you need someone who
 
05:33:41.330 --> 05:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
has a lot of expertise and now we're
 
05:33:43.490 --> 05:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
talking about this person having to
 
05:33:43.500 --> 05:33:46.128 align:start position:0%
talking about this person having to
probably

05:33:46.128 --> 05:33:46.138 align:start position:0%
probably
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
write rules and I know that writing
 
05:33:49.560 --> 05:33:51.170 align:start position:0%
write rules and I know that writing
rules

05:33:51.170 --> 05:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
is complicated and the department spends
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
hours and hours and hours and months
 
05:34:00.770 --> 05:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
writing the rules so what can we get
 
05:34:02.330 --> 05:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
what are we going to get for sixty
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
not very much
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
um just thinking about again if if the
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislative body is truly trying to find
 
05:34:16.490 --> 05:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
a strategy and develop strategies to
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
bring down the 290 million dollar budget
 
05:34:20.208 --> 05:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
just for the state
 
05:34:22.368 --> 05:34:22.378 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis not including all the
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
other dollars we spend on taxpayers
 
05:34:27.650 --> 05:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
um sixty thousand dollars is not going
 
05:34:29.650 --> 05:34:29.660 align:start position:0%
to get us very far
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
I think we need to have somebody who has
 
05:34:34.730 --> 05:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
the knowledge base that we can hire to
 
05:34:36.530 --> 05:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
help us understand how to develop those
 
05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
strategies there are strategies out
 
05:34:41.868 --> 05:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
there I talked to resident of Holt
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
earlier they give an example
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
when you start talking about drug waste
 
05:34:49.490 --> 05:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
just just an example one strategy to
 
05:34:51.708 --> 05:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
talk about drug waste folks there's
 
05:34:53.990 --> 05:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars that pass through
 
05:34:56.690 --> 05:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
that never get utilized a lot of the
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
Pharma companies of pbms
 
05:35:01.670 --> 05:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
got caught again sending things to
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
patients without them asked for it was
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
automatic refills
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
and Tricare the government stopped it
 
05:35:11.570 --> 05:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
because people were getting drugs after
 
05:35:13.850 --> 05:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
drugs after drugs and they were not
 
05:35:15.948 --> 05:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
utilizing it why didn't they stop it
 
05:35:18.170 --> 05:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
because the only way you make money in
 
05:35:19.730 --> 05:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy supply chain is when you
 
05:35:20.690 --> 05:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
sell something
 
05:35:22.730 --> 05:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
so there's no incentive to stop the
 
05:35:25.490 --> 05:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
process at the medical center we had
 
05:35:27.288 --> 05:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to Remicade that we
 
05:35:30.050 --> 05:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't use why because they kept
 
05:35:31.910 --> 05:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
coming even though the patient wasn't
 
05:35:33.770 --> 05:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
asked to have it and the patient would
 
05:35:35.868 --> 05:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
die the patient would change the therapy
 
05:35:38.090 --> 05:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't reuse it we call the
 
05:35:39.530 --> 05:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and said can we send it
 
05:35:41.930 --> 05:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
back to you nope
 
05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
we it's one way only sixty thousand
 
05:35:47.150 --> 05:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
dollars is a penis so the higher the
 
05:35:49.128 --> 05:35:49.138 align:start position:0%
reason it's 60 000 is because we
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
anticipated some higher lag if you think
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
that should be eighty thousand I you
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
know I'm fine with that but but the the
 
05:35:59.270 --> 05:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
05:36:01.910 --> 05:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
we should look at this with just a
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of humility we are New
 
05:36:05.868 --> 05:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're a very small part of the
 
05:36:08.208 --> 05:36:08.218 align:start position:0%
overall International Global Drug market
 
05:36:10.610 --> 05:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
we've got the federal government We're
 
05:36:13.208 --> 05:36:13.218 align:start position:0%
the Chief Executive who said
 
05:36:15.948 --> 05:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
controlling drug perform prescription
 
05:36:18.350 --> 05:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
drug prices is a top Administration
 
05:36:21.788 --> 05:36:21.798 align:start position:0%
whole government issue priority for them
 
05:36:24.410 --> 05:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
so to think that we're going to stand
 
05:36:25.970 --> 05:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
something up here in New Hampshire
 
05:36:28.550 --> 05:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to move the needle
 
05:36:30.770 --> 05:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
in the context of all the global
 
05:36:32.930 --> 05:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
economic issues going on and govern
 
05:36:36.590 --> 05:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
government regulatory is I I don't know
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
I this is why I think this should just
 
05:36:42.350 --> 05:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh take a pause and really make sure
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
that this program is is built right and
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
built in consistently with the other
 
05:36:50.690 --> 05:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
lovers of government so that we have you
 
05:36:53.510 --> 05:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
know a unified approach to maximize what
 
05:36:55.850 --> 05:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do and representation so
 
05:36:57.948 --> 05:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
with that I'm I think I'm going to just
 
05:37:00.530 --> 05:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
move on this because we've spent time
 
05:37:02.208 --> 05:37:02.218 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards you couldn't send
 
05:37:04.610 --> 05:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
any better than I could I don't disagree
 
05:37:07.070 --> 05:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
with us sitting down all of us including
 
05:37:09.530 --> 05:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
yourself over the summer and figuring
 
05:37:11.448 --> 05:37:11.458 align:start position:0%
how to make it right and do it that way
 
05:37:13.490 --> 05:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
versus trying to do it here in 10
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
minutes in this committee
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's been more than 10 minutes this
 
05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
issue has been going since uh November
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
and and now we're at a point where uh
 
05:37:25.788 --> 05:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know to get confidence that there's
 
05:37:27.410 --> 05:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to be discussion and a real look
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
at redundancy we're going to statute
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
because the comments and requests to
 
05:37:35.930 --> 05:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
look at it for quite a while were pushed
 
05:37:38.690 --> 05:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
aside is is not being true observations
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
that there was any redundancy so I I'm
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
sorry there's a trust but verify moment
 
05:37:45.410 --> 05:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
here too
 
05:37:47.330 --> 05:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:37:51.770 --> 05:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
so I would like to get a vote on whether
 
05:37:55.550 --> 05:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
should be accepted
 
05:38:01.850 --> 05:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:04.368 --> 05:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
05:38:06.430 --> 05:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
05:38:10.490 --> 05:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
1088 has been accepted there's also a
 
05:38:12.288 --> 05:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
Waller amendment that does something
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
similar it uh there it's that it's
 
05:38:17.330 --> 05:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
consistent in the sense that I think you
 
05:38:19.670 --> 05:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
recognize that we could move this to
 
05:38:23.448 --> 05:38:23.458 align:start position:0%
General funds but you kept their budget
 
05:38:26.930 --> 05:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
levels so do you have anything more to
 
05:38:26.940 --> 05:38:27.650 align:start position:0%
levels so do you have anything more to
add

05:38:27.650 --> 05:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
add
 
05:38:29.690 --> 05:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
I think I can
 
05:38:32.570 --> 05:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
see with the vote I can visualize what
 
05:38:34.610 --> 05:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
the vote will look like so I'll just
 
05:38:38.690 --> 05:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
withdraw it you'll withdrawn okay
 
05:38:40.670 --> 05:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards and
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
this isn't the end of this conversation
 
05:38:43.970 --> 05:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
although it started with the you and me
 
05:38:45.830 --> 05:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
in November I don't think we're we're
 
05:38:48.530 --> 05:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
done I mean probably this we're going to
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
have the same conversation in the Senate
 
05:38:53.150 --> 05:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
I I hope so
 
05:38:54.730 --> 05:38:54.740 align:start position:0%
um represent Edwards because
 
05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs are causing a
 
05:38:59.930 --> 05:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
lot of heartburn not just for the
 
05:39:01.730 --> 05:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but for a lot of people so
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
what we've been disagreeing about is
 
05:39:05.690 --> 05:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is an effective use
 
05:39:07.970 --> 05:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
of resources and if this is the way the
 
05:39:09.890 --> 05:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
government should behave this was
 
05:39:12.050 --> 05:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
unlimited power essentially in a very
 
05:39:13.970 --> 05:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
small group that had no checks and
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
balances so we have time to look at that
 
05:39:20.868 --> 05:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
um what else do we got we have
 
05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
um where are you at Mr Ripple I asked
 
05:39:29.270 --> 05:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
you to ignore what we were doing here uh
 
05:39:33.050 --> 05:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
so that you could focus on that rate
 
05:39:36.830 --> 05:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh let's see so how are you doing on the
 
05:39:38.690 --> 05:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
rate paperwork do we need to take a
 
05:39:41.090 --> 05:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
recess because we could take one if you
 
05:39:43.310 --> 05:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
need some more time to just send your
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
stuff up off to OLS it would help if you
 
05:39:48.170 --> 05:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
if the committee took about a
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
30 minute recess all right any problems

what what's your status Mr Ripple
 
06:21:43.128 --> 06:21:43.138 align:start position:0%
regarding having the uh the Medicaid
 
06:21:45.410 --> 06:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
rate increase Amendment ready to send
 
06:21:45.420 --> 06:21:46.548 align:start position:0%
rate increase Amendment ready to send
over

06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:21:49.610 --> 06:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
right it is with OLS and they're working
 
06:21:53.868 --> 06:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
on it now okay now how when do you think
 
06:21:58.490 --> 06:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:03.948 --> 06:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:06.048 --> 06:22:06.058 align:start position:0%
I'm really not prepared to commit to a
 
06:22:10.150 --> 06:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
specific time at this point okay so so
 
06:22:12.708 --> 06:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
anticipating that answer
 
06:22:15.530 --> 06:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
the next question is do you have enough
 
06:22:18.170 --> 06:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
information that we can share for people
 
06:22:19.850 --> 06:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
06:22:22.368 --> 06:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
so that they can agree on the concept we
 
06:22:24.650 --> 06:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
can vote on the concept
 
06:22:28.430 --> 06:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
see it later and then maybe Friday is
 
06:22:30.890 --> 06:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
nothing more than confirming that it's
 
06:22:34.930 --> 06:22:34.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:37.128 --> 06:22:37.138 align:start position:0%
you don't like that
 
06:22:40.368 --> 06:22:40.378 align:start position:0%
or you're thinking about it
 
06:22:42.288 --> 06:22:42.298 align:start position:0%
I think it would be much better if the
 
06:22:44.150 --> 06:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee voted on an actual amendment
 
06:22:47.448 --> 06:22:47.458 align:start position:0%
in hand okay
 
06:22:49.730 --> 06:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we're anticipating being here until
 
06:22:51.110 --> 06:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
eight o'clock at night do you think
 
06:22:53.448 --> 06:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
it'll be done by then it'll be done by
 
06:22:56.090 --> 06:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
eight I
 
06:22:58.490 --> 06:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
it'll be done before 8 o'clock
 
06:23:01.270 --> 06:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
I I would mention to guess
 
06:23:03.948 --> 06:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
I don't want to give a time but I would
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
say before six okay all right
 
06:23:11.330 --> 06:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
um so anyone who can hear me
 
06:23:14.628 --> 06:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
we are out of recess and division three
 
06:23:17.270 --> 06:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
is uh is started up
 
06:23:20.510 --> 06:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
first item of business
 
06:23:22.730 --> 06:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion during the the
 
06:23:26.270 --> 06:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
break about and this is a conversation
 
06:23:29.990 --> 06:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
primarily with uh Mr Ripple anyways so
 
06:23:31.628 --> 06:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
so Mr Ripple
 
06:23:36.670 --> 06:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:39.948 --> 06:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
1088 Hotel the one that we just accepted
 
06:23:41.750 --> 06:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
on the prescription drug affordability
 
06:23:46.570 --> 06:23:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.030 --> 06:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to do is amend this
 
06:23:50.040 --> 06:23:51.230 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to do is amend this
amendment

06:23:51.230 --> 06:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:23:55.850 --> 06:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
so that instead of it being 75 and 100
 
06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's 250 in each of the years I know
 
06:24:01.788 --> 06:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
that's the hb1 amendment yep so but I'm
 
06:24:03.110 --> 06:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
just telling you the sort of the whole
 
06:24:06.650 --> 06:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
agreement okay so instead of 75 100 it's
 
06:24:09.470 --> 06:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
250 250.
 
06:24:13.250 --> 06:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
instead of the one contract employee
 
06:24:14.690 --> 06:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
it's one
 
06:24:17.330 --> 06:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
permanent and I can write this down for
 
06:24:31.368 --> 06:24:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:34.368 --> 06:24:34.378 align:start position:0%
okay so in the house bill one side
 
06:24:37.010 --> 06:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
it was I'm sorry did you say 250 and
 
06:24:39.948 --> 06:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
250. yes sir
 
06:24:43.610 --> 06:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
and and um we can talk about the
 
06:24:46.970 --> 06:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
breakdown between the accounts uh but um
 
06:24:51.470 --> 06:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
so so the the first thing we need to
 
06:24:51.480 --> 06:24:52.368 align:start position:0%
so so the the first thing we need to
fund

06:24:52.368 --> 06:24:52.378 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:24:52.378 --> 06:24:53.868 align:start position:0%
fund
is

06:24:53.868 --> 06:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:24:58.670 --> 06:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
um somewhere there was a budget request
 
06:25:01.010 --> 06:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
where they ask for an executive director
 
06:25:07.090 --> 06:25:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:09.890 --> 06:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
we want to approve the executive
 
06:25:09.900 --> 06:25:11.270 align:start position:0%
we want to approve the executive
director

06:25:11.270 --> 06:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
director
 
06:25:11.280 --> 06:25:12.590 align:start position:0%
director
position

06:25:12.590 --> 06:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
06:25:15.830 --> 06:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
but we want to Sunset it two years after
 
06:25:15.840 --> 06:25:21.770 align:start position:0%
but we want to Sunset it two years after
higher

06:25:21.770 --> 06:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
so this will also necessitate a revised
 
06:25:26.448 --> 06:25:26.458 align:start position:0%
version of the hospital 2 Amendment yes
 
06:25:28.070 --> 06:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
06:25:30.230 --> 06:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
because we're changing the one contract
 
06:25:30.240 --> 06:25:37.990 align:start position:0%
because we're changing the one contract
employee

06:25:37.990 --> 06:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:43.250 --> 06:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
so so so I think I think that's uh it's
 
06:25:45.470 --> 06:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
two years sunset
 
06:25:48.230 --> 06:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
permanent unclassified executive
 
06:25:48.240 --> 06:25:49.310 align:start position:0%
permanent unclassified executive
director

06:25:49.310 --> 06:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
director
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
at the level that was specified earlier
 
06:25:55.730 --> 06:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:00.110 --> 06:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
total budget 250 and 250.
 
06:26:02.090 --> 06:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be my proposed
 
06:26:03.770 --> 06:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment here in just
 
06:26:05.628 --> 06:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
a moment and I'll explain it
 
06:26:08.150 --> 06:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure that while I
 
06:26:10.310 --> 06:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
had time Mr Ripple understood what what
 
06:26:12.350 --> 06:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
I was trying to do
 
06:26:15.010 --> 06:26:15.020 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
we have everyone back okay so we just
 
06:26:21.310 --> 06:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
voted 5-4 to accept
 
06:26:23.770 --> 06:26:23.780 align:start position:0%
hb2 item
 
06:26:26.570 --> 06:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
1088 that basically had a contract
 
06:26:30.470 --> 06:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
employee and of 75 000 and then 100 000
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the second year general fund
 
06:26:35.750 --> 06:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
allocation and the agreement reached
 
06:26:40.070 --> 06:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
with representative Marshawn was
 
06:26:44.330 --> 06:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
um that that employee will go will go
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
back to the executive director who's
 
06:26:49.548 --> 06:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
going to be an unclassified employee
 
06:26:52.010 --> 06:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
and the executive director shall be
 
06:26:54.350 --> 06:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
appointed by and serve at the pleasure
 
06:26:57.650 --> 06:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:01.250 --> 06:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
um we're going to do 250 250 the sunset
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the exposition will be for two years
 
06:27:07.670 --> 06:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
and that gives him
 
06:27:11.090 --> 06:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
the capacity the bandwidth to do all the
 
06:27:13.368 --> 06:27:13.378 align:start position:0%
analysis and all the establishment of
 
06:27:15.890 --> 06:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
all of the rules for this very
 
06:27:17.510 --> 06:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
complicated board
 
06:27:20.810 --> 06:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
so it's it's less it's less of a beating
 
06:27:23.570 --> 06:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
than what this was and representative
 
06:27:23.580 --> 06:27:26.708 align:start position:0%
than what this was and representative
Merchant

06:27:26.708 --> 06:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:30.048 --> 06:27:30.058 align:start position:0%
and I came to just an agreement that if
 
06:27:33.770 --> 06:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
he if we did that uh he he would no
 
06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
longer oppose the amendment
 
06:27:40.250 --> 06:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
06:27:43.310 --> 06:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
um rep representative somebody would you
 
06:27:44.990 --> 06:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a question no I was just going to
 
06:27:46.670 --> 06:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
say thank you for working that out with
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I think he
 
06:27:51.530 --> 06:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
really appreciated it I've worked with
 
06:27:54.230 --> 06:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
him before Gary and I get along great we
 
06:27:57.770 --> 06:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
just we're just a little at odds on this
 
06:28:00.770 --> 06:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
but I I I I think he's legitimate when
 
06:28:02.750 --> 06:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
he says he wants to work it out
 
06:28:05.208 --> 06:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
and and like I said we agree on the
 
06:28:08.448 --> 06:28:08.458 align:start position:0%
intent it's just we have to have the
 
06:28:10.850 --> 06:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
right government approach to trying to
 
06:28:14.090 --> 06:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
achieve that result so would you state
 
06:28:16.850 --> 06:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
what you heard me say about an amendment
 
06:28:20.510 --> 06:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
to 1088 and the attending hb1 item
 
06:28:20.520 --> 06:28:23.390 align:start position:0%
to 1088 and the attending hb1 item
please

06:28:23.390 --> 06:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.110 --> 06:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
so you would like 1088 to be revised so
 
06:28:28.730 --> 06:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
that the board could still employ an
 
06:28:31.128 --> 06:28:31.138 align:start position:0%
executive director and did you want that
 
06:28:34.010 --> 06:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
to be an unclassified employee still if
 
06:28:36.590 --> 06:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
you if you go and look at one zero eight
 
06:28:39.110 --> 06:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
eight you'll see the strikethrough okay
 
06:28:41.390 --> 06:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
so just reverse the strike through this
 
06:28:43.250 --> 06:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
reverse the strikethrough
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes but Sunset the position two years
 
06:28:53.628 --> 06:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:56.090 --> 06:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
and and so that kind of a position will
 
06:28:56.100 --> 06:28:57.708 align:start position:0%
and and so that kind of a position will
generate

06:28:57.708 --> 06:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
generate
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
salary line and benefits lines and other
 
06:29:03.770 --> 06:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
benefits lines and whatever is left
 
06:29:07.310 --> 06:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
after that can be put into sort of a
 
06:29:10.548 --> 06:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
general that General expense line okay
 
06:29:12.770 --> 06:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
and so on the hospital one side in
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
addition to that
 
06:29:16.250 --> 06:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
allocation between the the personnel
 
06:29:18.650 --> 06:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
class lines you want the total to be 250
 
06:29:22.250 --> 06:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
000 per year of General funds yes okay
 
06:29:25.730 --> 06:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
could we put one dollar in the uh other
 
06:29:28.850 --> 06:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
Revenue under contributions
 
06:29:33.890 --> 06:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.390 --> 06:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
but but AARP and
 
06:29:40.670 --> 06:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
new new wave new Futures whatever it is
 
06:29:42.650 --> 06:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
sounds like they may want to give them a
 
06:29:44.030 --> 06:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
bunch of money yeah but where are they
 
06:29:45.830 --> 06:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to put it representative Edwards
 
06:29:47.570 --> 06:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to figure it out these
 
06:29:50.570 --> 06:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
guys build accounts all the time
 
06:29:50.580 --> 06:29:51.770 align:start position:0%
guys build accounts all the time
okay

06:29:51.770 --> 06:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:29:54.410 --> 06:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
06:29:56.270 --> 06:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
if you put a dollar in via the budget
 
06:29:59.208 --> 06:29:59.218 align:start position:0%
the account has to be created yeah so
 
06:30:01.610 --> 06:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
we'll do a dollar
 
06:30:05.030 --> 06:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
06:30:07.368 --> 06:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
with that amendment can I just go ahead
 
06:30:11.330 --> 06:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
and do a a vote show hands all those in
 
06:30:14.390 --> 06:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
favor of amending the pdab amendment as
 
06:30:17.750 --> 06:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
I just described please raise your hand
 
06:30:19.930 --> 06:30:19.940 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
06:30:23.510 --> 06:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you
 
06:30:23.520 --> 06:30:27.470 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you
um

06:30:27.470 --> 06:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:32.750 --> 06:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
so we had a discussion on item 10.
 
06:30:36.530 --> 06:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
and I think what we want to do on item
 
06:30:36.540 --> 06:30:37.670 align:start position:0%
and I think what we want to do on item
10.

06:30:37.670 --> 06:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
10.
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:51.110 --> 06:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:53.090 --> 06:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
we I think we wanted to cut the general
 
06:30:56.030 --> 06:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
funds by 60 percent
 
06:30:58.610 --> 06:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
but is what happens to the federal match
 
06:31:00.590 --> 06:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
if we cut
 
06:31:04.610 --> 06:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
at 60 percent on the system of care
 
06:31:08.930 --> 06:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
will that get reduced 60 percent as well
 
06:31:11.448 --> 06:31:11.458 align:start position:0%
it probably right
 
06:31:13.788 --> 06:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
I didn't consider that
 
06:31:15.350 --> 06:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
in our caucus
 
06:31:17.868 --> 06:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
looking at this line item line
 
06:31:17.878 --> 06:31:19.730 align:start position:0%
looking at this line item line
yeah

06:31:19.730 --> 06:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:31:22.128 --> 06:31:22.138 align:start position:0%
um likely yes again some of the
 
06:31:24.830 --> 06:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
complexities around these contracts is
 
06:31:27.470 --> 06:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
that the funding source is contingent
 
06:31:30.048 --> 06:31:30.058 align:start position:0%
upon the individual
 
06:31:33.650 --> 06:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
whether it's Medicaid title for e Foster
 
06:31:36.530 --> 06:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
Care or other federal funds
 
06:31:40.128 --> 06:31:40.138 align:start position:0%
okay so so Ms Fox we have a a proposal
 
06:31:43.010 --> 06:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
to reduce the general funds numbers to
 
06:31:47.270 --> 06:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
60 of what's currently shown which is
 
06:31:52.070 --> 06:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
year one uh 12.4 essentially in year two
 
06:31:58.850 --> 06:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:00.288 --> 06:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
the director of
 
06:32:02.270 --> 06:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
the behavioral health
 
06:32:04.070 --> 06:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I know there were questions earlier
 
06:32:06.110 --> 06:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
about this be happy to answer those
 
06:32:08.390 --> 06:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
questions but directly
 
06:32:08.400 --> 06:32:09.110 align:start position:0%
questions but directly
um

06:32:09.110 --> 06:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:13.310 --> 06:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
to your point we put the this request in
 
06:32:15.948 --> 06:32:15.958 align:start position:0%
based on experience for contracts that
 
06:32:18.530 --> 06:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
we had never had in place before in
 
06:32:20.448 --> 06:32:20.458 align:start position:0%
funding services that we hadn't funded
 
06:32:24.548 --> 06:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
before and so we now have better numbers
 
06:32:27.230 --> 06:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
and this is the request that reflects
 
06:32:31.070 --> 06:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
those to provide support for a Workforce
 
06:32:34.128 --> 06:32:34.138 align:start position:0%
that would not be captured in the
 
06:32:36.410 --> 06:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increase
 
06:32:39.470 --> 06:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
questions representable so is it
 
06:32:41.930 --> 06:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
possible for you to break out what of
 
06:32:45.890 --> 06:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
that 12.4 was pre-existing contracts and
 
06:32:48.170 --> 06:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
what if that is new
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
so that all of the system of care
 
06:32:55.070 --> 06:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
contracts those were enrolled providers
 
06:32:57.048 --> 06:32:57.058 align:start position:0%
through dcyf which has a different
 
06:33:00.288 --> 06:33:00.298 align:start position:0%
enrollment than Medicaid otherwise every
 
06:33:02.570 --> 06:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
single contract was brand new and the
 
06:33:04.250 --> 06:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
funding was new as a result of
 
06:33:07.128 --> 06:33:07.138 align:start position:0%
legislative actions in previous years
 
06:33:10.548 --> 06:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
so there is no history because we just
 
06:33:12.890 --> 06:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
got these contracts in place within
 
06:33:17.510 --> 06:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
about a year ago I believe yeah these
 
06:33:20.030 --> 06:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
funds would be brand new because after
 
06:33:23.150 --> 06:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
our experience we found that the
 
06:33:26.030 --> 06:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
providers are short in order to have the
 
06:33:28.788 --> 06:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
capacity they don't have the workforce
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
and this would provide that funding that
 
06:33:35.090 --> 06:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
has been identified as needing to be
 
06:33:37.208 --> 06:33:37.218 align:start position:0%
able to fully
 
06:33:40.190 --> 06:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
use the capacity the beds that they have
 
06:33:42.708 --> 06:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
and to fully staff and utilize those
 
06:33:42.718 --> 06:33:44.030 align:start position:0%
and to fully staff and utilize those
beds

06:33:44.030 --> 06:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
beds
 
06:33:44.040 --> 06:33:45.590 align:start position:0%
beds
so

06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:48.170 --> 06:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
looking at this maybe
 
06:33:50.030 --> 06:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
um when what year did we have the bucket
 
06:33:51.530 --> 06:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
with all the holes in it that stuff was
 
06:33:53.390 --> 06:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
draining out anyway that was a
 
06:33:55.850 --> 06:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
transportation bucket if I recall get
 
06:33:57.708 --> 06:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
the mic just a little closer my hearing
 
06:33:59.270 --> 06:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
is getting worse one year we had a
 
06:34:01.070 --> 06:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
bucket that had a bunch of holes and
 
06:34:03.048 --> 06:34:03.058 align:start position:0%
stuff was a pouring throw if we're
 
06:34:06.470 --> 06:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
trying to fill in the gaps right now in
 
06:34:09.048 --> 06:34:09.058 align:start position:0%
the overall budget and we're starting up
 
06:34:10.930 --> 06:34:10.940 align:start position:0%
new programs with new contracts
 
06:34:13.690 --> 06:34:13.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that that's an area that's
 
06:34:16.128 --> 06:34:16.138 align:start position:0%
unfortunately makes higher high on the
 
06:34:17.990 --> 06:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
list of things that might be an area to
 
06:34:20.150 --> 06:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
try and find some money so I'm guessing
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
my question to you is if we were to to
 
06:34:26.030 --> 06:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
cut it back to 60 of the state they
 
06:34:28.610 --> 06:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
anticipated ask
 
06:34:31.250 --> 06:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
what can you do with that
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
um is 60 or roughly 60 the right number
 
06:34:37.128 --> 06:34:37.138 align:start position:0%
is there a particular set of contracts
 
06:34:38.810 --> 06:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
that you guys would say these are the
 
06:34:40.430 --> 06:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
ones that we want and these are the
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
three or four that are really important
 
06:34:44.288 --> 06:34:44.298 align:start position:0%
to us we take these over the others
 
06:34:47.570 --> 06:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
the contracts are underfunded because we
 
06:34:49.910 --> 06:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
had the lack of experience to determine
 
06:34:52.310 --> 06:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
what the cost was going to be again that
 
06:34:54.708 --> 06:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
we have those three buckets of funding
 
06:34:57.650 --> 06:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
and we're finding that many of the
 
06:34:59.690 --> 06:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
children that need these residential
 
06:34:59.700 --> 06:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
children that need these residential
services

06:35:01.510 --> 06:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:35:04.610 --> 06:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
are not dcyf involved so we can't use
 
06:35:07.250 --> 06:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that come for dcyf
 
06:35:10.190 --> 06:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
they're not for Medicaid expenses
 
06:35:13.670 --> 06:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid billable expenses and in fact
 
06:35:15.890 --> 06:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to be coming to the fiscal
 
06:35:18.890 --> 06:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
Committee in April asking for a transfer
 
06:35:21.890 --> 06:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
of funds into this line item to help
 
06:35:32.470 --> 06:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:35.150 --> 06:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
no no this is good information that's
 
06:35:37.310 --> 06:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
06:35:39.350 --> 06:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for thanks for you for being
 
06:35:39.360 --> 06:35:40.610 align:start position:0%
thank you for thanks for you for being
here

06:35:40.610 --> 06:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:35:43.730 --> 06:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
so before you came Nathan said that this
 
06:35:45.890 --> 06:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
is probably affects about four to five
 
06:35:45.900 --> 06:35:48.170 align:start position:0%
is probably affects about four to five
hundred

06:35:48.170 --> 06:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
06:35:52.128 --> 06:35:52.138 align:start position:0%
people I think children and
 
06:35:54.770 --> 06:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
what I want to what I'm interested in I
 
06:35:57.410 --> 06:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
all of these programs are 24-hour
 
06:36:00.048 --> 06:36:00.058 align:start position:0%
programs they're all running they all
 
06:36:00.058 --> 06:36:01.070 align:start position:0%
programs they're all running they all
have

06:36:01.070 --> 06:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:36:03.948 --> 06:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
children in them and
 
06:36:08.270 --> 06:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
what happens if this rate increase is
 
06:36:10.190 --> 06:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
not in place
 
06:36:12.708 --> 06:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
and we know what the cost to take we
 
06:36:15.288 --> 06:36:15.298 align:start position:0%
know that this is a very expensive
 
06:36:18.948 --> 06:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
service are these are these providers
 
06:36:21.650 --> 06:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
going to be viable do you have a feeling
 
06:36:24.830 --> 06:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
that any of them would leave
 
06:36:27.410 --> 06:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
the field and not not be able to take
 
06:36:29.150 --> 06:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
care of some of our kids
 
06:36:31.310 --> 06:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't have hard data on that so I
 
06:36:33.970 --> 06:36:33.980 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I give you that
 
06:36:37.128 --> 06:36:37.138 align:start position:0%
context however there are providers that
 
06:36:39.350 --> 06:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
are struggling mightily and may choose
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
not to continue to provide the services
 
06:36:43.208 --> 06:36:43.218 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
06:36:46.610 --> 06:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
and if you recall I think we did a
 
06:36:48.110 --> 06:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
presentation talking about the different
 
06:36:51.230 --> 06:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
levels of care and so we're finding that
 
06:36:53.330 --> 06:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
the levels of care that are needed in
 
06:36:55.490 --> 06:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
the community are it's based on Acuity
 
06:36:58.490 --> 06:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
and so the level three and level fours
 
06:37:00.650 --> 06:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
are the ones that you start ratcheting
 
06:37:03.650 --> 06:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
up the Acuity level and so that requires
 
06:37:06.410 --> 06:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
a staffing ratio if those children
 
06:37:09.230 --> 06:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
aren't getting the services through
 
06:37:12.048 --> 06:37:12.058 align:start position:0%
these programs I think that we could
 
06:37:14.750 --> 06:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
speculate on where they would end up and
 
06:37:17.868 --> 06:37:17.878 align:start position:0%
what would happen with families with the
 
06:37:19.430 --> 06:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
Youth Detention Center
 
06:37:19.440 --> 06:37:22.150 align:start position:0%
Youth Detention Center
Etc

06:37:22.150 --> 06:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:24.288 --> 06:37:24.298 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
06:37:25.910 --> 06:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:28.128 --> 06:37:28.138 align:start position:0%
did the did the governor's people give a
 
06:37:34.310 --> 06:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:37.070 --> 06:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
we we didn't receive any specific reason
 
06:37:38.930 --> 06:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
my assumption is like many of our
 
06:37:40.430 --> 06:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs they were working
 
06:37:43.548 --> 06:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
within their revenue projections
 
06:37:45.070 --> 06:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:47.270 --> 06:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
so in other words the governor didn't
 
06:37:49.128 --> 06:37:49.138 align:start position:0%
have the revenue to fund it it was
 
06:37:51.288 --> 06:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
considered and at this point we're
 
06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
starting to think that we may have less
 
06:37:55.788 --> 06:37:55.798 align:start position:0%
money than the governor so so this is
 
06:37:58.310 --> 06:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy decision are are
 
06:38:01.310 --> 06:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
there any you have a representative how
 
06:38:02.810 --> 06:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
many facilities are you talking about
 
06:38:05.330 --> 06:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
for these four to five hundred beds I
 
06:38:07.670 --> 06:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
have the notes I'd have to go back and
 
06:38:12.288 --> 06:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:12.298 --> 06:38:13.368 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:38:13.368 --> 06:38:13.378 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:38:15.890 --> 06:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
um we I think we have uh
 
06:38:18.770 --> 06:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
we have 31 programs I believe so when we
 
06:38:20.570 --> 06:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
talk about programs then we talk about
 
06:38:23.810 --> 06:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
the actual contracts I I want to get the
 
06:38:25.910 --> 06:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
accurate number and not um State
 
06:38:28.850 --> 06:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
something erroneously but I can get that
 
06:38:31.850 --> 06:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
information a question for either of you
 
06:38:35.390 --> 06:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
do there are the contracts cost uh cost
 
06:38:38.510 --> 06:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
base or are they fixed rate uh with a
 
06:38:40.490 --> 06:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
point in time with after you've done
 
06:38:43.970 --> 06:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
cost analysis you re-review the rates or
 
06:38:47.628 --> 06:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:50.208 --> 06:38:50.218 align:start position:0%
typically with these contracts it's cost
 
06:38:53.448 --> 06:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but Nathan's scrolling
 
06:38:54.830 --> 06:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
through the contract to see what the
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
payment terms are
 
06:38:58.430 --> 06:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
so it could be we've been making
 
06:39:00.890 --> 06:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
payments and
 
06:39:03.048 --> 06:39:03.058 align:start position:0%
um on a projection basis and then the
 
06:39:05.330 --> 06:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
cost reconciliation is coming up with
 
06:39:07.788 --> 06:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
something different no so so the the
 
06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
governor and council is extremely
 
06:39:12.548 --> 06:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
adamant about never paying in advance
 
06:39:15.048 --> 06:39:15.058 align:start position:0%
95 percent of our contracts are cost
 
06:39:16.310 --> 06:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement if they're not cost
 
06:39:17.868 --> 06:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement they're payment upon
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
deliverable I'm just verifying that that
 
06:39:22.788 --> 06:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
this is cost reimbursement
 
06:39:22.798 --> 06:39:23.330 align:start position:0%
this is cost reimbursement
um

06:39:23.330 --> 06:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:23.340 --> 06:39:26.090 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:39:26.090 --> 06:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:39:26.100 --> 06:39:29.208 align:start position:0%
so
we

06:39:29.208 --> 06:39:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:33.230 --> 06:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we we we follow the the the
 
06:39:35.810 --> 06:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
same process whereby we receive invoices
 
06:39:37.788 --> 06:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
before we make payment for for these
 
06:39:40.730 --> 06:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
individuals and because of that so they
 
06:39:43.610 --> 06:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
need to have a bed filled in order to
 
06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill and if they have Staffing shortages
 
06:39:48.350 --> 06:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
they're unable to bill because
 
06:39:50.868 --> 06:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
um and so that makes it precarious for
 
06:39:53.628 --> 06:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
them and and puts them at risk
 
06:39:56.390 --> 06:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
we don't pay for empty beds
 
06:39:59.150 --> 06:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
so it's one of the possibilities of a d
 
06:40:01.788 --> 06:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
of a non-funding of this uh this request
 
06:40:04.070 --> 06:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
just a reduction in the number of
 
06:40:07.788 --> 06:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
available services or beds with this uh
 
06:40:09.650 --> 06:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
which would free up enough money to
 
06:40:12.830 --> 06:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
raise the rates but uh dramatically uh
 
06:40:15.230 --> 06:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
reduce our capacity
 
06:40:19.490 --> 06:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:22.190 --> 06:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman to your point asking
 
06:40:25.128 --> 06:40:25.138 align:start position:0%
about the reduction by 60 percent I
 
06:40:26.510 --> 06:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:40:26.520 --> 06:40:28.430 align:start position:0%
think that
um

06:40:28.430 --> 06:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:31.850 --> 06:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
oh 60 so 40 reduction
 
06:40:34.128 --> 06:40:34.138 align:start position:0%
so I you know I would advocate for any
 
06:40:36.170 --> 06:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
funding that you could provide and find
 
06:40:39.470 --> 06:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
room in um as you do your projections
 
06:40:41.150 --> 06:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
and your funding
 
06:40:43.070 --> 06:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
um knowing that it still will be short
 
06:40:46.490 --> 06:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
more comments questions representative
 
06:40:54.230 --> 06:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:56.030 --> 06:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think I'd leave the proposal what was
 
06:40:58.368 --> 06:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
discussed and start there and just I
 
06:41:00.128 --> 06:41:00.138 align:start position:0%
guess can you
 
06:41:02.448 --> 06:41:02.458 align:start position:0%
prioritize some of the programs because
 
06:41:04.670 --> 06:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's not 60 percent of the rate increase
 
06:41:07.670 --> 06:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
right that doesn't help because that may
 
06:41:09.650 --> 06:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
not attract the staff as necessary it
 
06:41:12.288 --> 06:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
might be that certain certain facilities
 
06:41:13.970 --> 06:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
or programs
 
06:41:16.310 --> 06:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
see a larger increase but you don't fund
 
06:41:17.448 --> 06:41:17.458 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
06:41:19.368 --> 06:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
I think we want to take that back but
 
06:41:20.690 --> 06:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
yes that would be something that we
 
06:41:23.270 --> 06:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
would consider okay so I thought the
 
06:41:25.310 --> 06:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
proposal I was expecting was that you
 
06:41:28.610 --> 06:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
were going to ask us for a straw vote on
 
06:41:31.430 --> 06:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking this line item and making it 60
 
06:41:33.470 --> 06:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
percent of the request that's what I
 
06:41:35.330 --> 06:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
thought you were going to say I I will
 
06:41:37.850 --> 06:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
gladly make that request so Mr chair
 
06:41:40.190 --> 06:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
would you please do a straw vote on line
 
06:41:44.150 --> 06:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
10 at 60 of these numbers I will that's
 
06:41:48.048 --> 06:41:48.058 align:start position:0%
surprising uh so all those in favor of
 
06:41:51.590 --> 06:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
reducing line 10 to 60 percent of the
 
06:41:54.890 --> 06:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
ask raise your hand
 
06:41:54.900 --> 06:41:57.708 align:start position:0%
ask raise your hand

06:41:57.718 --> 06:42:00.288 align:start position:0%
opposed
okay

06:42:00.288 --> 06:42:00.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:42:04.810 --> 06:42:04.820 align:start position:0%
um all right so I want to talk about uh
 
06:42:08.390 --> 06:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative walners Amendment we've
 
06:42:10.910 --> 06:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
already passed one of them
 
06:42:15.110 --> 06:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh this one I want to talk about next is
 
06:42:15.120 --> 06:42:17.090 align:start position:0%
uh this one I want to talk about next is
um

06:42:17.090 --> 06:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:20.448 --> 06:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
the seven million dollar one one zero
 
06:42:24.350 --> 06:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:28.310 --> 06:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
I have on my note that we want to I
 
06:42:30.530 --> 06:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
wrote Sunset but I didn't say what I
 
06:42:32.510 --> 06:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
meant about that what do you recall what
 
06:42:34.128 --> 06:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
we were going to do on sun setting this
 
06:42:36.288 --> 06:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
is there any component of this that we
 
06:42:39.830 --> 06:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
said we we could Sunset I think you I I
 
06:42:41.868 --> 06:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
thought when you said it I thought you
 
06:42:43.548 --> 06:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
were saying that
 
06:42:45.110 --> 06:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
um it would at the end of the biennium
 
06:42:46.970 --> 06:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
it would have to be Revisited
 
06:42:50.448 --> 06:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
I okay I like that I just didn't want to
 
06:42:52.610 --> 06:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
misremember something so
 
06:42:54.788 --> 06:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
so my
 
06:42:59.208 --> 06:42:59.218 align:start position:0%
motion if if you'll accept this is I'd
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
like to go ahead and accept your
 
06:43:04.490 --> 06:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment as is with the provision that
 
06:43:08.448 --> 06:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
this expires at the end of this budget
 
06:43:12.230 --> 06:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor raise your hand
 
06:43:14.930 --> 06:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
okay that passes
 
06:43:17.930 --> 06:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
oh so now we're going to talk about line
 
06:43:20.330 --> 06:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
item five sorry could I just ask which
 
06:43:23.090 --> 06:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
amendment number that was yes sir that
 
06:43:26.810 --> 06:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
was uh the one zero nine three okay
 
06:43:29.750 --> 06:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:33.410 --> 06:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
so it was all fine except we just need
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
to position it so it expires at the end
 
06:43:39.410 --> 06:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:43.430 --> 06:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay are you are you caught up
 
06:43:45.948 --> 06:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
yes and just to be clear so you did not
 
06:43:45.958 --> 06:43:47.990 align:start position:0%
yes and just to be clear so you did not
take

06:43:47.990 --> 06:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
take
 
06:43:50.208 --> 06:43:50.218 align:start position:0%
you did not take a similar vote on one
 
06:43:53.750 --> 06:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
zero nine zero we have not okay Mr chair
 
06:43:56.090 --> 06:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
did we agree on the language that it was
 
06:43:58.670 --> 06:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
going to be instead of 85 350 percent of
 
06:43:58.680 --> 06:43:59.868 align:start position:0%
going to be instead of 85 350 percent of
FPL

06:43:59.868 --> 06:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
FPL
 
06:44:01.368 --> 06:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
I thought we did
 
06:44:06.110 --> 06:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
I I think we did but uh I'm it
 
06:44:08.690 --> 06:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
do you mind if what did we decide on
 
06:44:11.090 --> 06:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
that one I I would like to try to get
 
06:44:14.270 --> 06:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
consistent language across statutes so
 
06:44:18.288 --> 06:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
that legislators can compare apples to
 
06:44:20.810 --> 06:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
apples you know so when we know we're
 
06:44:23.030 --> 06:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
doing something in program X that it
 
06:44:25.850 --> 06:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
should be related to program y
 
06:44:28.070 --> 06:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
is what do you think about that in this
 
06:44:29.750 --> 06:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
case I think it turns out to be more
 
06:44:32.930 --> 06:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
money if you if you make the eligibility
 
06:44:35.868 --> 06:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
a different you know the the comparable
 
06:44:39.288 --> 06:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
FPL number is it fed language that came
 
06:44:41.750 --> 06:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
along with a match
 
06:44:44.868 --> 06:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
this I did this is the federal language
 
06:44:47.868 --> 06:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
okay but but there are many programs
 
06:44:51.048 --> 06:44:51.058 align:start position:0%
including child care at this point that
 
06:44:51.058 --> 06:44:51.948 align:start position:0%
including child care at this point that
use

06:44:51.948 --> 06:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:44:55.490 --> 06:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
percentage of poverty so I mean I think
 
06:44:58.070 --> 06:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
it can be either way I think it will
 
06:45:01.490 --> 06:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
cost a little more if you do the 350.
 
06:45:03.770 --> 06:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
so if this is compatible with the
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
federal language I don't want to make
 
06:45:07.490 --> 06:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
that more complicated I want the federal
 
06:45:10.430 --> 06:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
language to be easily interpreted okay
 
06:45:11.930 --> 06:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
06:45:14.570 --> 06:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
all right it's a little less I think too
 
06:45:16.670 --> 06:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
06:45:20.208 --> 06:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
um so I think did we do a strong vote on
 
06:45:20.218 --> 06:45:20.890 align:start position:0%
um so I think did we do a strong vote on
that

06:45:20.890 --> 06:45:20.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:45:24.288 --> 06:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
yes okay so then I was getting ready to
 
06:45:27.830 --> 06:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
talk about line item five why not line
 
06:45:30.590 --> 06:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
item five without an eruption is the
 
06:45:36.170 --> 06:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:38.750 --> 06:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
visiting because my eyesight is not good
 
06:45:41.628 --> 06:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
home visiting formula grant
 
06:45:45.288 --> 06:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf do you have a
 
06:45:46.850 --> 06:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this or was that
 
06:45:48.288 --> 06:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney that was going to
 
06:45:51.230 --> 06:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:51.240 --> 06:45:54.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:45:54.110 --> 06:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:45:56.150 --> 06:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna
 
06:46:02.890 --> 06:46:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:05.570 --> 06:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
my con
 
06:46:07.548 --> 06:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman I would move
 
06:46:10.850 --> 06:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
to delete then that line
 
06:46:13.610 --> 06:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
the conversation around deletion of line
 
06:46:13.620 --> 06:46:16.910 align:start position:0%
the conversation around deletion of line
five

06:46:16.910 --> 06:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:20.510 --> 06:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
do you know how I feel about no so okay
 
06:46:23.868 --> 06:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
so motion on deletion of line five Raise
 
06:46:26.830 --> 06:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
your hands if you're in favor
 
06:46:29.448 --> 06:46:29.458 align:start position:0%
uh opposed
 
06:46:32.810 --> 06:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to delete that line
 
06:46:32.820 --> 06:46:34.850 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to delete that line
okay

06:46:34.850 --> 06:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:46:37.250 --> 06:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
now we'll go to the walner amendment
 
06:46:37.260 --> 06:46:40.250 align:start position:0%
now we'll go to the walner amendment
1090

06:46:40.250 --> 06:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
1090
 
06:46:43.430 --> 06:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
this one had an effect of about 2.9
 
06:46:43.440 --> 06:46:46.490 align:start position:0%
this one had an effect of about 2.9
Million

06:46:46.490 --> 06:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:49.430 --> 06:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that this Sunset
 
06:46:51.890 --> 06:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
so that it was just during this budget
 
06:46:51.900 --> 06:46:55.310 align:start position:0%
so that it was just during this budget
year

06:46:55.310 --> 06:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:57.708 --> 06:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
were there any other changes in there I
 
06:47:00.048 --> 06:47:00.058 align:start position:0%
see notes on our discussions but I don't
 
06:47:02.030 --> 06:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
see anything else that needed to be
 
06:47:02.040 --> 06:47:03.890 align:start position:0%
see anything else that needed to be
tweaked

06:47:03.890 --> 06:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
tweaked
 
06:47:05.930 --> 06:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
you see anything else that we'd agreed
 
06:47:11.628 --> 06:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
to tweak no I see nothing else okay so I
 
06:47:15.170 --> 06:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
propose that we accept
 
06:47:18.230 --> 06:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
one zero nine zero
 
06:47:20.750 --> 06:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
with a provision that this will sunset
 
06:47:25.070 --> 06:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:25.080 --> 06:47:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:47:26.270 --> 06:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:47:28.730 --> 06:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
okay all right all those in favor raise
 
06:47:30.410 --> 06:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
06:47:30.420 --> 06:47:32.030 align:start position:0%
your hand
opposed

06:47:32.030 --> 06:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
06:47:32.040 --> 06:47:38.690 align:start position:0%
opposed
okay

06:47:38.690 --> 06:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:40.850 --> 06:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chair did we already do one zero six
 
06:47:42.468 --> 06:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
zero I think we did
 
06:47:42.478 --> 06:47:43.968 align:start position:0%
zero I think we did
yes

06:47:43.968 --> 06:47:43.978 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:47:51.490 --> 06:47:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:54.190 --> 06:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
representative hole did you have
 
06:47:57.288 --> 06:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
something you'd like us to vote on
 
06:47:57.298 --> 06:47:58.548 align:start position:0%
something you'd like us to vote on
so

06:47:58.548 --> 06:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:58.558 --> 06:47:59.628 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:47:59.628 --> 06:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:01.788 --> 06:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
as proposed before right we should
 
06:48:03.530 --> 06:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
include the three right we should ask
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
the department to put in the body
 
06:48:07.250 --> 06:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
scanner I did look it is an x-ray system
 
06:48:09.650 --> 06:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
but it is versus millimeter wavelength
 
06:48:11.690 --> 06:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
but it is not something that's going to
 
06:48:13.730 --> 06:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
create issues I still would leave the
 
06:48:16.250 --> 06:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
funding at the 1099
 
06:48:19.548 --> 06:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
sorry the 999 10 million dollars total
 
06:48:22.010 --> 06:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
um which is approximately a 2.5 million
 
06:48:26.448 --> 06:48:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:29.570 --> 06:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
and so that includes the flexibility to
 
06:48:32.448 --> 06:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
be put in the footnote to to go buy that
 
06:48:33.830 --> 06:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment
 
06:48:35.990 --> 06:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
correct and it includes the flexibility
 
06:48:40.010 --> 06:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
to move money around within the accounts
 
06:48:41.750 --> 06:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
as appropriate
 
06:48:45.350 --> 06:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead so I think if you're reducing
 
06:48:47.448 --> 06:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
the entire budget to 10 million per year
 
06:48:50.030 --> 06:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
then I don't really have any detail on
 
06:48:51.830 --> 06:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
how to reduce the individual line
 
06:48:54.230 --> 06:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
numbers unless you want a proportional
 
06:48:56.208 --> 06:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
reduction so if you're going to go that
 
06:48:58.190 --> 06:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
route it might be better to just do this
 
06:49:00.048 --> 06:49:00.058 align:start position:0%
as a house built too appropriate I know
 
06:49:01.250 --> 06:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
you've already voted to take it out of
 
06:49:03.170 --> 06:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 but it might be better to
 
06:49:04.968 --> 06:49:04.978 align:start position:0%
do it as a House Bill 2 appropriation of
 
06:49:07.788 --> 06:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
a straight 10 million per year couldn't
 
06:49:09.770 --> 06:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
can't we keep it in HP one with a
 
06:49:11.750 --> 06:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
footnote that the department can move
 
06:49:15.288 --> 06:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
between expensive items without fiscal
 
06:49:17.868 --> 06:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
approval but all of the individual class
 
06:49:20.330 --> 06:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
lines add up to 11 million one hundred
 
06:49:21.590 --> 06:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
twenty three thousand in the first year
 
06:49:22.968 --> 06:49:22.978 align:start position:0%
and eleven million four hundred nine
 
06:49:25.490 --> 06:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
thousand in the second so
 
06:49:28.430 --> 06:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
so just do a proportional reduction to
 
06:49:30.948 --> 06:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
get to 10 million okay and with a foot
 
06:49:33.590 --> 06:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
now and that way it still lives in hb1
 
06:49:33.600 --> 06:49:35.330 align:start position:0%
now and that way it still lives in hb1
okay

06:49:35.330 --> 06:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:49:37.670 --> 06:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
that would mean none of the class lines
 
06:49:39.948 --> 06:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
are budgeted accurately because the
 
06:49:42.190 --> 06:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
personnel class lines are to the dollar
 
06:49:45.170 --> 06:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
based on people in those positions today
 
06:49:47.690 --> 06:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
or if they're vacant they're funded at
 
06:49:50.750 --> 06:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
step one so you're saying you you want
 
06:49:54.170 --> 06:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
to keep the Personnel line item the same
 
06:49:57.830 --> 06:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
and the benefits the same and that any
 
06:50:00.110 --> 06:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
modification to get to the 10 million
 
06:50:02.330 --> 06:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
should come from the other expense lines
 
06:50:05.330 --> 06:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh the the medical staff is also a
 
06:50:06.948 --> 06:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
contracted line
 
06:50:10.430 --> 06:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
um I I mean if I I think if it's the per
 
06:50:12.048 --> 06:50:12.058 align:start position:0%
if it's the intention of the committee
 
06:50:14.448 --> 06:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
to reduce it to 10 million at this point
 
06:50:15.708 --> 06:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
in time
 
06:50:17.448 --> 06:50:17.458 align:start position:0%
um just just given the time we have I
 
06:50:18.650 --> 06:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know if you just give an
 
06:50:21.590 --> 06:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision as Kevin was suggesting to
 
06:50:23.330 --> 06:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
provide a back of the budget cut for
 
06:50:25.750 --> 06:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
those years
 
06:50:29.208 --> 06:50:29.218 align:start position:0%
I you you trailed off because my hearing
 
06:50:32.090 --> 06:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
is bad the last sentence about the next
 
06:50:35.090 --> 06:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
year what did you it I I mean I I think
 
06:50:37.190 --> 06:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
at this point in time just just get
 
06:50:38.868 --> 06:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
given where we're at and I won't
 
06:50:41.150 --> 06:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily have time to work with the
 
06:50:43.910 --> 06:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
finance team and and Joe ribsum to
 
06:50:45.788 --> 06:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
determine which lines we should reduce
 
06:50:49.250 --> 06:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
whether it's an hb2 provision that
 
06:50:50.990 --> 06:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
essentially directs the department to
 
06:50:52.788 --> 06:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
cut to cut
 
06:50:56.810 --> 06:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 24 by 1.1 million and
 
06:50:59.570 --> 06:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
1.4 million dollars in say fiscal year
 
06:51:02.390 --> 06:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
25 as an hb2 provision if that would be
 
06:51:04.250 --> 06:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
the best way to go so that we're not
 
06:51:06.890 --> 06:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
creating class lines that are that are
 
06:51:06.900 --> 06:51:10.910 align:start position:0%
creating class lines that are that are
inaccurate

06:51:10.910 --> 06:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:12.948 --> 06:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
the majority of the money is in
 
06:51:12.958 --> 06:51:16.070 align:start position:0%
the majority of the money is in
personnel

06:51:16.070 --> 06:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:19.070 --> 06:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
he doesn't leave it in hp2
 
06:51:21.230 --> 06:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
I know but we spent so much time talking
 
06:51:23.868 --> 06:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
about getting from hp2 to HP one so
 
06:51:26.270 --> 06:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
future budget committees can have of
 
06:51:28.070 --> 06:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
continuity and
 
06:51:29.990 --> 06:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
I get it but if we're gonna do this
 
06:51:32.750 --> 06:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's the recommendation it makes sense
 
06:51:34.670 --> 06:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:51:36.770 --> 06:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
okay so do I understand this correctly a
 
06:51:39.288 --> 06:51:39.298 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 appropriation of 10 million
 
06:51:42.708 --> 06:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
per year stating that of that 300 000
 
06:51:44.750 --> 06:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
shall be used for the purchase of a full
 
06:51:46.910 --> 06:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
body scanner
 
06:51:46.920 --> 06:51:47.628 align:start position:0%
body scanner
um

06:51:47.628 --> 06:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:50.448 --> 06:51:50.458 align:start position:0%
I I would almost prefer something like
 
06:51:54.590 --> 06:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh not to exceed 325
 
06:51:56.930 --> 06:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
000 or you know so that if they if they
 
06:52:00.230 --> 06:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
get a deal for 260 you know they can
 
06:52:02.390 --> 06:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
they can use the change
 
06:52:06.230 --> 06:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
an amount not to exceed 325 000.
 
06:52:07.850 --> 06:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
and we think it's going to be three
 
06:52:09.708 --> 06:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand I've heard it could be
 
06:52:12.910 --> 06:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
as low as 250. I just don't want to like
 
06:52:16.368 --> 06:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
whatever excess money can be reapplied
 
06:52:20.750 --> 06:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:24.350 --> 06:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
got it uh representative Wallner or do
 
06:52:25.788 --> 06:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
 
06:52:28.010 --> 06:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
Mooney you almost never speak do you
 
06:52:29.930 --> 06:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
have something to say
 
06:52:32.690 --> 06:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you you had mentioned Mr White
 
06:52:35.090 --> 06:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
that there are contract agreements
 
06:52:37.190 --> 06:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps maintenance agreements and the
 
06:52:39.410 --> 06:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
like are the figures we're tossing
 
06:52:42.230 --> 06:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
around now about this body scanner going
 
06:52:45.410 --> 06:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
to cover all of the expenses not just
 
06:52:49.788 --> 06:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:53.690 --> 06:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
well we would be reducing the entire
 
06:52:57.708 --> 06:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
budget by 2.5 million dollars so
 
06:52:57.718 --> 06:52:58.490 align:start position:0%
budget by 2.5 million dollars so
um

06:52:58.490 --> 06:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:01.010 --> 06:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
to hit those numbers we would probably
 
06:53:05.170 --> 06:53:05.180 align:start position:0%
have to hold positions vacant or
 
06:53:08.090 --> 06:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
find find funding from somewhere make
 
06:53:09.410 --> 06:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
certain assumptions through a transfer
 
06:53:11.750 --> 06:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
process to to figure that out
 
06:53:11.760 --> 06:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
process to to figure that out
so

06:53:19.910 --> 06:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:22.510 --> 06:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recess for five minutes
 
06:53:22.520 --> 06:56:19.270 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recess for five minutes
[Music]

06:56:19.270 --> 06:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:19.280 --> 06:56:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:56:20.990 --> 06:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:56:23.288 --> 06:56:23.298 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna come back out of our
 
06:56:27.650 --> 06:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
caucus recess and um representative hole
 
06:56:30.830 --> 06:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
what do you have to say
 
06:56:32.570 --> 06:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
um after much discussion
 
06:56:35.448 --> 06:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
um instead of adjusting the entire
 
06:56:39.350 --> 06:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
budget and moving it to hb2 will reduce
 
06:56:41.868 --> 06:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
what the reduction that we're talking
 
06:56:43.730 --> 06:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
about and take out the one million
 
06:56:46.670 --> 06:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
dollars which is the 500 000 per year in
 
06:56:48.468 --> 06:56:48.478 align:start position:0%
overtime leaving the rest of the budget
 
06:56:51.048 --> 06:56:51.058 align:start position:0%
where it is but allowing the flexibility
 
06:56:53.510 --> 06:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
to still move money amongst accounts if
 
06:56:58.190 --> 06:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:58.200 --> 06:57:00.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:57:00.890 --> 06:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:57:00.900 --> 06:57:02.530 align:start position:0%
okay
so

06:57:02.530 --> 06:57:02.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:57:05.750 --> 06:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on that do you
 
06:57:08.150 --> 06:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
understand Mr Ripple you got it
 
06:57:11.030 --> 06:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
I do so zero out the overtime
 
06:57:13.610 --> 06:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
allow add a footnote allowing
 
06:57:15.590 --> 06:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility to move between accounts
 
06:57:18.170 --> 06:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
without going to fiscal and also
 
06:57:21.350 --> 06:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
allowing for or requiring up to 325 to
 
06:57:24.410 --> 06:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
be spent on a scanner right
 
06:57:26.690 --> 06:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
the 325 comes out of this total
 
06:57:28.610 --> 06:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
somewhere wherever
 
06:57:30.770 --> 06:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
yes not in addition to it's part of it
 
06:57:33.170 --> 06:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
yep representative walner and the
 
06:57:34.910 --> 06:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility to move between lines
 
06:57:38.330 --> 06:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:41.208 --> 06:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
it would be all lines if it's written
 
06:57:43.070 --> 06:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
the way I expect it to be written okay
 
06:57:45.590 --> 06:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
all lines I think that was the intent
 
06:57:47.090 --> 06:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
was all lines right we're trying to give
 
06:57:49.250 --> 06:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
them an operating budget
 
06:57:49.260 --> 06:57:50.448 align:start position:0%
them an operating budget
okay

06:57:50.448 --> 06:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:57:51.830 --> 06:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:57:54.410 --> 06:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
06:57:57.590 --> 06:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
um if you're in favor of the new whole
 
06:58:02.090 --> 06:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:06.830 --> 06:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
if you're opposed to the whole okay
 
06:58:09.890 --> 06:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
so all right so we're going to go with
 
06:58:20.208 --> 06:58:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:22.548 --> 06:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
let's bring up
 
06:58:26.690 --> 06:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
um the Earth amendment to line 24 the
 
06:58:28.548 --> 06:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
back of the budget Personnel reduction
 
06:58:32.990 --> 06:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:35.690 --> 06:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
is what that was was the earth Amendment
 
06:58:38.270 --> 06:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
passed out yesterday just one moment you
 
06:58:40.490 --> 06:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
had so you had a version
 
06:58:43.010 --> 06:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
um my version and then there was a Nerf
 
06:58:45.110 --> 06:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe well this one is
 
06:58:47.530 --> 06:58:47.540 align:start position:0%
also in your name and I do have it back
 
06:59:19.670 --> 06:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:24.048 --> 06:59:24.058 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is 0.927h still in play though
 
06:59:27.590 --> 06:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
for this for the purpose of discussion I
 
06:59:30.468 --> 06:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
I I'm sort of lost what was the purpose
 
06:59:32.990 --> 06:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:35.270 --> 06:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
that was the same
 
06:59:38.810 --> 06:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
that was the same back of the budget I'm
 
06:59:40.250 --> 06:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
not sure the difference real quick I'll
 
06:59:41.270 --> 06:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
06:59:41.280 --> 06:59:42.770 align:start position:0%
look at it
okay

06:59:42.770 --> 06:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:59:44.750 --> 06:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I believe that's what we're talking
 
06:59:51.410 --> 06:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:53.448 --> 06:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
go ahead are you ready for me okay all
 
06:59:58.330 --> 06:59:58.340 align:start position:0%
right so this is limiting three
 
07:00:01.670 --> 07:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
categories of head counts
 
07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
and then eliminating then the money the
 
07:00:06.530 --> 07:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
revenue the general fund freeing up is
 
07:00:08.510 --> 07:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
coming from eliminating the positions
 
07:00:11.690 --> 07:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
above those head counts so in the case
 
07:00:14.330 --> 07:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
of full-time permanent it's restricting
 
07:00:17.510 --> 07:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
it to 3 000 which Nets out to
 
07:00:17.520 --> 07:00:19.070 align:start position:0%
it to 3 000 which Nets out to
uh

07:00:19.070 --> 07:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:00:21.410 --> 07:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
213 full-time permanent positions I
 
07:00:23.390 --> 07:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
guess we're above that that were funded
 
07:00:24.948 --> 07:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
fully funded
 
07:00:26.868 --> 07:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken is that is that a read
 
07:00:29.030 --> 07:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
that or 22 full-time what is my how do I
 
07:00:31.670 --> 07:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
read that Mr Ripple
 
07:00:31.680 --> 07:00:39.110 align:start position:0%
read that Mr Ripple
oh

07:00:39.110 --> 07:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:41.090 --> 07:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
there are 22 full-time temporary
 
07:00:43.850 --> 07:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
positions that are currently funded that
 
07:00:45.410 --> 07:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
would not be funded as a result of this
 
07:00:48.410 --> 07:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
amendment okay so 213 permanent flow
 
07:00:51.468 --> 07:00:51.478 align:start position:0%
time would not be funded 22 temporary
 
07:00:55.548 --> 07:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
full-time would not be funded and 84.
 
07:00:58.010 --> 07:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
a temporary part-time would not be
 
07:01:00.410 --> 07:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
funded is that accurate
 
07:01:03.230 --> 07:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay over the two years so the net
 
07:01:06.770 --> 07:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
result of removing those positions is
 
07:01:08.510 --> 07:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
the 27 million nine hundred thousand
 
07:01:09.730 --> 07:01:09.740 align:start position:0%
dollars you see
 
07:01:17.150 --> 07:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:19.070 --> 07:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
is that accurate
 
07:01:21.788 --> 07:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
that with these Personnel limitations
 
07:01:25.330 --> 07:01:25.340 align:start position:0%
the net effect as we'd expect
 
07:01:28.548 --> 07:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
27.9 million that's correct although
 
07:01:31.128 --> 07:01:31.138 align:start position:0%
that figure is an estimate
 
07:01:34.670 --> 07:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
um it assumes on who gets I I get it
 
07:01:42.948 --> 07:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:45.350 --> 07:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
and to be clear at least from my point
 
07:01:47.150 --> 07:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
of view yeah
 
07:01:50.930 --> 07:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak for anybody else
 
07:01:53.090 --> 07:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
um the idea behind this is again to
 
07:01:55.968 --> 07:01:55.978 align:start position:0%
boost the Medicaid uh the funds
 
07:01:57.890 --> 07:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
available to the Medicaid um
 
07:01:59.990 --> 07:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
right enhancements
 
07:02:02.330 --> 07:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
from my point of view
 
07:02:06.048 --> 07:02:06.058 align:start position:0%
right I I I I agree anytime we can find
 
07:02:08.208 --> 07:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
any money I I want to put it into the
 
07:02:11.150 --> 07:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:11.160 --> 07:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:02:11.990 --> 07:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:14.448 --> 07:02:14.458 align:start position:0%
all right so representative waller or
 
07:02:18.350 --> 07:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
norgren either of you so
 
07:02:23.448 --> 07:02:23.458 align:start position:0%
the 213 positions are they filled
 
07:02:25.510 --> 07:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
positions are they
 
07:02:28.250 --> 07:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
positions where some are unfilled that's
 
07:02:30.170 --> 07:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
a great question representative I
 
07:02:31.670 --> 07:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
apologize I should have been much more
 
07:02:34.128 --> 07:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
clear about that I don't have my notes
 
07:02:35.390 --> 07:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
so funny but they're definitely not
 
07:02:38.030 --> 07:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
filled positions in fact they even in
 
07:02:41.150 --> 07:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
all three cases they leave uh quite a
 
07:02:43.490 --> 07:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
bit of Headroom um off the top of my
 
07:02:46.490 --> 07:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
head they're about a
 
07:02:49.128 --> 07:02:49.138 align:start position:0%
they still have
 
07:02:51.468 --> 07:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
quite a few vacancies up to 80 percent
 
07:02:53.690 --> 07:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
of their current total hundred percent
 
07:02:55.730 --> 07:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
in each of the three cases
 
07:02:58.190 --> 07:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
so in no case it was any was that it was
 
07:03:00.350 --> 07:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
a person a field position a person a
 
07:03:01.968 --> 07:03:01.978 align:start position:0%
position filled with a person filled I
 
07:03:04.310 --> 07:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated that didn't happen at all and
 
07:03:06.530 --> 07:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're also still empty fully funded
 
07:03:07.850 --> 07:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
positions in each of those three
 
07:03:07.860 --> 07:03:09.350 align:start position:0%
positions in each of those three
categories

07:03:09.350 --> 07:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
categories
 
07:03:11.448 --> 07:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:03:15.350 --> 07:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
so let me just expand expound on that
 
07:03:18.048 --> 07:03:18.058 align:start position:0%
but uh okay so when we did something
 
07:03:21.830 --> 07:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
similar last budget at the time the
 
07:03:25.788 --> 07:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
department had something like 3200 and
 
07:03:28.190 --> 07:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
change authorized full-time permanent
 
07:03:28.200 --> 07:03:29.510 align:start position:0%
change authorized full-time permanent
employees

07:03:29.510 --> 07:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
07:03:35.270 --> 07:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
they had only 2 650 that were actually
 
07:03:35.280 --> 07:03:36.708 align:start position:0%
they had only 2 650 that were actually
filled

07:03:36.708 --> 07:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
filled
 
07:03:40.190 --> 07:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
so when we set the limit at 3 000
 
07:03:43.330 --> 07:03:43.340 align:start position:0%
the the working logic at the time was
 
07:03:46.968 --> 07:03:46.978 align:start position:0%
that gave them the ability to prioritize
 
07:03:50.030 --> 07:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
the higher of 350
 
07:03:54.110 --> 07:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
employees up to 350 new employees
 
07:03:57.650 --> 07:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
and given the workforce vacancy rates
 
07:03:59.930 --> 07:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
07:04:02.448 --> 07:04:02.458 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem like that was going to be
 
07:04:05.330 --> 07:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
a harsh limit that they were going to
 
07:04:07.128 --> 07:04:07.138 align:start position:0%
have trouble filling all those anyways
 
07:04:09.288 --> 07:04:09.298 align:start position:0%
at least that was what was in my mind
 
07:04:11.570 --> 07:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:04:15.230 --> 07:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
this this continuation of effectively a
 
07:04:16.968 --> 07:04:16.978 align:start position:0%
3 000
 
07:04:19.190 --> 07:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
limit ceiling
 
07:04:21.770 --> 07:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the actual bill rate
 
07:04:23.868 --> 07:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
is this time around I think I've asked
 
07:04:26.690 --> 07:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
I've probably been told three times but
 
07:04:31.010 --> 07:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
I I I I I think they probably have
 
07:04:36.530 --> 07:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the 2000s for actual fill
 
07:04:38.868 --> 07:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
so they probably still have some room
 
07:04:42.230 --> 07:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
between the fill that they're at and and
 
07:04:43.910 --> 07:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
three thousand
 
07:04:46.730 --> 07:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
yes so could Mr White do you have any
 
07:04:51.048 --> 07:04:51.058 align:start position:0%
comment to make sure so just just to be
 
07:04:54.410 --> 07:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
clear so the the 213 positions and the
 
07:04:57.048 --> 07:04:57.058 align:start position:0%
22 full-time 84 part-time that assumes
 
07:05:00.128 --> 07:05:00.138 align:start position:0%
those positions are 100 General funds
 
07:05:02.448 --> 07:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
very few of our positions are 100
 
07:05:05.930 --> 07:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
General funds so like some really quick
 
07:05:07.430 --> 07:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope math we have about
 
07:05:10.490 --> 07:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
350 360 million dollars of personnel
 
07:05:13.128 --> 07:05:13.138 align:start position:0%
costs and that includes OT part-time
 
07:05:16.128 --> 07:05:16.138 align:start position:0%
full-time class 10 class 12.
 
07:05:18.830 --> 07:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
some quick quick math you take 50 of
 
07:05:20.330 --> 07:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
that you're like you're you're basically
 
07:05:22.670 --> 07:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
about 174 million dollars in general
 
07:05:27.350 --> 07:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
funds so and then you take the 27.9
 
07:05:29.390 --> 07:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
and you apply that to that this would
 
07:05:31.548 --> 07:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
force us to have a minimum vacancy rate
 
07:05:32.990 --> 07:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
of what I'm estimating I'm just doing
 
07:05:35.150 --> 07:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
some quick math here 15 to 16 of our
 
07:05:38.048 --> 07:05:38.058 align:start position:0%
positions so we had a we had a 21
 
07:05:40.968 --> 07:05:40.978 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in November the
 
07:05:42.890 --> 07:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner has been pushing HR to
 
07:05:45.048 --> 07:05:45.058 align:start position:0%
develop very clear strategies for hiring
 
07:05:49.250 --> 07:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
we're currently 19 this is going to hurt
 
07:05:51.770 --> 07:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
the department in a really bad way if
 
07:05:53.570 --> 07:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
we're targeting positions the people are
 
07:05:56.030 --> 07:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
the heart of the department and when it
 
07:05:56.930 --> 07:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
comes to New Hampshire Hospital
 
07:05:59.868 --> 07:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hampstead the path Center when I you
 
07:06:01.910 --> 07:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
know basically if this goes through come
 
07:06:05.208 --> 07:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
July I'm going to tell Joe ripsom hold X
 
07:06:07.128 --> 07:06:07.138 align:start position:0%
number of
 
07:06:09.590 --> 07:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
um of of child protective service
 
07:06:12.170 --> 07:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
workers vacant for the biennium I'm
 
07:06:14.208 --> 07:06:14.218 align:start position:0%
going to tell Melissa Hardy pulled X
 
07:06:15.708 --> 07:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
number of Adult Protective Service
 
07:06:18.890 --> 07:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
workers and you know for this biennium
 
07:06:22.070 --> 07:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's 22.6 million dollars and for New
 
07:06:23.570 --> 07:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital that equated to over
 
07:06:25.250 --> 07:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
three million dollars in general funds
 
07:06:27.110 --> 07:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
positions so it's going to be that much
 
07:06:29.510 --> 07:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
higher higher but dcyf that's the area
 
07:06:31.788 --> 07:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
where the positions BFA that's area with
 
07:06:33.590 --> 07:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
positions New Hampshire hospital
 
07:06:36.288 --> 07:06:36.298 align:start position:0%
glencliffe all of these areas that's
 
07:06:38.410 --> 07:06:38.420 align:start position:0%
what we'd be targeting
 
07:06:40.670 --> 07:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
I totally recognize the difficult place
 
07:06:42.530 --> 07:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
that you are in because you you know you
 
07:06:44.930 --> 07:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
and you you guys probably say same thing
 
07:06:47.868 --> 07:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
about me but it's not lost on me by any
 
07:06:50.810 --> 07:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
means but but I think to Target the
 
07:06:53.690 --> 07:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
Personnel I don't think and I spoke with
 
07:06:55.548 --> 07:06:55.558 align:start position:0%
the commissioner about this earlier we
 
07:06:57.530 --> 07:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
we don't think that's a good way to go
 
07:06:59.090 --> 07:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
about this at all if you want to give us
 
07:07:00.708 --> 07:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
a back of the budget cut fine give us a
 
07:07:03.410 --> 07:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
back a budget cut but the 3 000
 
07:07:06.410 --> 07:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
positions in the 213 they're meaningless
 
07:07:09.048 --> 07:07:09.058 align:start position:0%
because we actually receive a much
 
07:07:10.548 --> 07:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
deeper cut when we're targeting General
 
07:07:13.490 --> 07:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
funds and personnel only
 
07:07:16.010 --> 07:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
so so what's your offer on the back of
 
07:07:19.850 --> 07:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:22.730 --> 07:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
I mean a worse or I don't know it's it's
 
07:07:25.070 --> 07:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
kind of like like lemon juice or salt in
 
07:07:27.890 --> 07:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
a wound yes and so if we're going to put
 
07:07:29.930 --> 07:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
salt in the wound I'd rather just have a
 
07:07:32.090 --> 07:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
back to the budget cut and not Target
 
07:07:35.030 --> 07:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
Personnel I'm just asking you for the
 
07:07:36.310 --> 07:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
number now
 
07:07:38.810 --> 07:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
a number
 
07:07:40.548 --> 07:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a back of the budget
 
07:07:44.930 --> 07:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:47.510 --> 07:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
I I I think that's really a policy
 
07:07:49.610 --> 07:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
decision I mean we we submitted our our
 
07:07:51.830 --> 07:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
agency budget and I mean that those were
 
07:07:53.090 --> 07:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
our priorities can I ask a different
 
07:07:55.850 --> 07:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
question go ahead uh oh representative
 
07:07:58.610 --> 07:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry when I looked through
 
07:08:01.430 --> 07:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
your budget I see a lot of contracts
 
07:08:04.070 --> 07:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
that go out others
 
07:08:06.170 --> 07:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
what percentage do you think is going
 
07:08:08.330 --> 07:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
out in contract in your budget some of
 
07:08:10.670 --> 07:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
the lines I look at it it's almost 30 40
 
07:08:13.610 --> 07:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
percent going out in contracts sure
 
07:08:15.890 --> 07:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
um it is a significant number
 
07:08:18.650 --> 07:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
um our Personnel is about 10 of our
 
07:08:18.660 --> 07:08:19.730 align:start position:0%
um our Personnel is about 10 of our
budget

07:08:19.730 --> 07:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
budget
 
07:08:21.410 --> 07:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I mean we we have accounts like we
 
07:08:24.230 --> 07:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
have the DD account that's 400 and some
 
07:08:26.090 --> 07:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
odd million dollars each year we have
 
07:08:29.330 --> 07:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
our MCO you know that our 7948 our class
 
07:08:31.670 --> 07:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
line is 400 million dollars you know for
 
07:08:33.650 --> 07:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
for our managed care I don't have that
 
07:08:35.628 --> 07:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
figure off the top of my head but it
 
07:08:37.610 --> 07:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
would probably be north of a billion
 
07:08:39.288 --> 07:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
dollars if you looked at our class 102
 
07:08:41.990 --> 07:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
in class 74.
 
07:08:44.448 --> 07:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
thank you I also see that as a place to
 
07:08:46.730 --> 07:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
save sure
 
07:08:46.740 --> 07:08:48.948 align:start position:0%
save sure
representative

07:08:48.948 --> 07:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:08:50.930 --> 07:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
so a couple comments I understand your
 
07:08:50.940 --> 07:08:52.310 align:start position:0%
so a couple comments I understand your
position

07:08:52.310 --> 07:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
position
 
07:08:54.530 --> 07:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
as noted
 
07:08:56.390 --> 07:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I'll just note that these positions
 
07:08:58.070 --> 07:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
have never been well I should never
 
07:08:59.750 --> 07:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
might be strong but certainly I would
 
07:09:02.750 --> 07:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
say in your tenure Benfield in the case
 
07:09:04.430 --> 07:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the full-time not permanent you've
 
07:09:06.530 --> 07:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
got 45 or 110 filled right now as I
 
07:09:08.330 --> 07:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
understand in the case of the part-time
 
07:09:11.330 --> 07:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
247 and 419 in the case of the permanent
 
07:09:13.430 --> 07:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
full-time those positions have been
 
07:09:16.610 --> 07:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
vacant many of them since 2018 at least
 
07:09:19.368 --> 07:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
we've gone back that far but let's go
 
07:09:21.170 --> 07:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
with your approach and we just name a
 
07:09:21.180 --> 07:09:22.190 align:start position:0%
with your approach and we just name a
number

07:09:22.190 --> 07:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
number
 
07:09:22.200 --> 07:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
number
um

07:09:23.110 --> 07:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:26.090 --> 07:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cut or reduction
 
07:09:29.690 --> 07:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
whatever will you not fight to get that
 
07:09:32.208 --> 07:09:32.218 align:start position:0%
eliminated in the Senate because it's a
 
07:09:34.850 --> 07:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
non-specific reduction because in the
 
07:09:38.570 --> 07:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
past we have been admonished as a
 
07:09:41.990 --> 07:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee for not being specific about
 
07:09:46.070 --> 07:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
areas that we want to see reductions in
 
07:09:46.080 --> 07:09:48.788 align:start position:0%
areas that we want to see reductions in
foreign

07:09:48.788 --> 07:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:09:51.048 --> 07:09:51.058 align:start position:0%
I think you already know that of course
 
07:09:52.850 --> 07:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
we're going to Advocate not to have the
 
07:09:55.850 --> 07:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
back of the budget be cut because
 
07:09:58.310 --> 07:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
um like for for this year alone there's
 
07:10:00.170 --> 07:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
I think an estimated 89 million dollar
 
07:10:02.690 --> 07:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
agency lapse and typically the state
 
07:10:05.628 --> 07:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
looks to us for about half of that so
 
07:10:07.788 --> 07:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
for the current biennium you've probably
 
07:10:09.948 --> 07:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
heard me at fiscal we've had to reduce
 
07:10:12.890 --> 07:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
our Personnel by 22.6 million dollars
 
07:10:15.468 --> 07:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
and so for this past biennium I think
 
07:10:18.948 --> 07:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
our expenditure lapse was roughly 26.4
 
07:10:20.750 --> 07:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
07:10:23.868 --> 07:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
um because we're traditionally our lapse
 
07:10:25.548 --> 07:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
is often coming from from some of those
 
07:10:27.350 --> 07:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel but it was a little bit
 
07:10:29.390 --> 07:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
different a little bit different this
 
07:10:31.968 --> 07:10:31.978 align:start position:0%
year and I um you know I I respect and
 
07:10:33.530 --> 07:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
understand the position that you are in
 
07:10:35.090 --> 07:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
and that that criticism that you have
 
07:10:37.128 --> 07:10:37.138 align:start position:0%
faced I I just
 
07:10:40.430 --> 07:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm really concerned about
 
07:10:43.070 --> 07:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
how this kind of it it's it's not
 
07:10:44.570 --> 07:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
consistent with what what the
 
07:10:46.250 --> 07:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner has been saying publicly
 
07:10:48.048 --> 07:10:48.058 align:start position:0%
has been
 
07:10:50.330 --> 07:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
um talking to the public about talking
 
07:10:52.910 --> 07:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the staff about about her priority to
 
07:10:55.310 --> 07:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
try to get the Staffing levels back up
 
07:10:56.810 --> 07:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
to where they should be just because
 
07:10:59.090 --> 07:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
well the pandemic does feel like a
 
07:11:01.610 --> 07:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
really long time ago you know we lost we
 
07:11:03.830 --> 07:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
had a quite a bit of churn through that
 
07:11:05.810 --> 07:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're we're still
 
07:11:07.490 --> 07:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
feeling those effects I just did a staff
 
07:11:09.530 --> 07:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
survey for my division uh it's still in
 
07:11:11.330 --> 07:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
process but the feedback that I'm
 
07:11:13.010 --> 07:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
getting still is they still feel
 
07:11:15.830 --> 07:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
overworked they still feel pressed
 
07:11:17.510 --> 07:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're doing things to
 
07:11:19.190 --> 07:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
change that but but I'm just really
 
07:11:22.190 --> 07:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about another Target to the
 
07:11:23.750 --> 07:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel I just don't think in the long
 
07:11:25.788 --> 07:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
run that's going to allow us to
 
07:11:28.190 --> 07:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
effectively you know implement the
 
07:11:30.230 --> 07:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates Implement uh the the
 
07:11:31.448 --> 07:11:31.458 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
07:11:33.890 --> 07:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
agreement efforts and and all the other
 
07:11:36.708 --> 07:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
projects that that we want to do for
 
07:11:39.468 --> 07:11:39.478 align:start position:0%
um for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
07:11:41.090 --> 07:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
so here's what I would have proposed
 
07:11:44.090 --> 07:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
that we stick with the
 
07:11:46.850 --> 07:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
only putting the cap on the full-time
 
07:11:49.250 --> 07:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
permanent positions which I think is
 
07:11:50.990 --> 07:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
another amendment that folks mentioned
 
07:11:51.000 --> 07:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
another amendment that folks mentioned
earlier

07:11:52.310 --> 07:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
07:11:54.468 --> 07:11:54.478 align:start position:0%
um so don't so we don't constrain them
 
07:11:56.270 --> 07:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
like on the flexibility with regard to
 
07:11:56.280 --> 07:11:57.110 align:start position:0%
like on the flexibility with regard to
the

07:11:57.110 --> 07:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:11:58.368 --> 07:11:58.378 align:start position:0%
the temporary positions that have
 
07:11:58.378 --> 07:11:59.090 align:start position:0%
the temporary positions that have
different

07:11:59.090 --> 07:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:12:02.390 --> 07:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
um ratios but again these positions have
 
07:12:03.830 --> 07:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
not been filled it's nothing to do with
 
07:12:06.048 --> 07:12:06.058 align:start position:0%
covid going way back before covet
 
07:12:08.810 --> 07:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
they've not been filled
 
07:12:12.530 --> 07:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
so so let's let's act on that and and
 
07:12:15.830 --> 07:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
shift the conversation over to zero nine
 
07:12:18.170 --> 07:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
two seven which is I think the amendment
 
07:12:19.548 --> 07:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
you were referring to
 
07:12:22.788 --> 07:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
and this is 23.4
 
07:12:26.530 --> 07:12:26.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:29.810 --> 07:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
continuing the imposition of the same
 
07:12:32.208 --> 07:12:32.218 align:start position:0%
ceiling that we've operated under the
 
07:12:34.368 --> 07:12:34.378 align:start position:0%
current year
 
07:12:37.128 --> 07:12:37.138 align:start position:0%
or representative Stringham did you want
 
07:12:39.110 --> 07:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
to look at this before you asked your
 
07:12:41.448 --> 07:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
question you had one earlier well let me
 
07:12:41.458 --> 07:12:42.530 align:start position:0%
question you had one earlier well let me
let

07:12:42.530 --> 07:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
let
 
07:12:44.930 --> 07:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
um if it's okay before you jump to that
 
07:12:44.940 --> 07:12:46.128 align:start position:0%
um if it's okay before you jump to that
but

07:12:46.128 --> 07:12:46.138 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:12:47.750 --> 07:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we have roughly 3 000
 
07:12:50.390 --> 07:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
employees 213 would be about seven
 
07:12:53.448 --> 07:12:53.458 align:start position:0%
percent I'm just wondering if the 360
 
07:12:55.548 --> 07:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
million dollar in
 
07:12:55.558 --> 07:12:56.270 align:start position:0%
million dollar in
um

07:12:56.270 --> 07:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:59.570 --> 07:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh Personnel cost or did we do two years
 
07:13:01.368 --> 07:13:01.378 align:start position:0%
in one of these in one year for the
 
07:13:03.468 --> 07:13:03.478 align:start position:0%
other or are you really looking at
 
07:13:07.250 --> 07:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
fifteen to sixteen percent uh reduction
 
07:13:09.590 --> 07:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
oh I I apologize I was just doing some
 
07:13:11.868 --> 07:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
very quick quick math here but but the
 
07:13:13.250 --> 07:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
way that plays out though and I think
 
07:13:16.430 --> 07:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this before is we
 
07:13:18.110 --> 07:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
never even have an opportunity to post
 
07:13:19.730 --> 07:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
those positions so it effectively
 
07:13:23.090 --> 07:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
creates that that that vacancy rate
 
07:13:25.430 --> 07:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
because it constricts us there I I again
 
07:13:28.010 --> 07:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
I think that if we can have
 
07:13:30.170 --> 07:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
more if if we do have a back of the
 
07:13:32.448 --> 07:13:32.458 align:start position:0%
budget cut more flexibility in what that
 
07:13:34.310 --> 07:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
looks like and um you know I think
 
07:13:35.868 --> 07:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
representative Earth is accurate
 
07:13:37.368 --> 07:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
particularly with the part-time
 
07:13:39.708 --> 07:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
employees there have been positions that
 
07:13:42.048 --> 07:13:42.058 align:start position:0%
have been vacant for some time I mean I
 
07:13:43.850 --> 07:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
think that's certainly an area that we
 
07:13:46.730 --> 07:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
would likely lapse from
 
07:13:48.830 --> 07:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's just trying to find a
 
07:13:51.170 --> 07:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
balance between recognizing the fact
 
07:13:53.390 --> 07:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
that we will still have vacancies but
 
07:13:55.610 --> 07:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
also recognizing the fact that there are
 
07:13:57.468 --> 07:13:57.478 align:start position:0%
a lot of very clear conservative efforts
 
07:13:59.510 --> 07:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
on the part of leadership to fill those
 
07:14:01.730 --> 07:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
positions to get us closer to where we
 
07:14:02.810 --> 07:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
should be
 
07:14:05.208 --> 07:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
uh just a follow-up to we're kind of
 
07:14:06.948 --> 07:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
unique among states I think one of your
 
07:14:10.070 --> 07:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
first presentations uh compared the
 
07:14:12.350 --> 07:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
number of employees per dollar of spend
 
07:14:13.670 --> 07:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we have in health and human
 
07:14:15.948 --> 07:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
services and there's a pretty unique
 
07:14:18.230 --> 07:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
structure in New Hampshire compared to
 
07:14:20.930 --> 07:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
all all of our comparables and that we
 
07:14:22.548 --> 07:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
do a lot more work and do a lot more
 
07:14:25.250 --> 07:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
spending with fewer employees and rely
 
07:14:28.610 --> 07:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh substantially more on
 
07:14:28.620 --> 07:14:29.410 align:start position:0%
uh substantially more on
um

07:14:29.410 --> 07:14:29.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:29.420 --> 07:14:31.270 align:start position:0%
um
as

07:14:31.270 --> 07:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
07:14:34.670 --> 07:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Weiler mentioned on contract
 
07:14:37.730 --> 07:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
cases so would it be easier for you to
 
07:14:37.740 --> 07:14:38.530 align:start position:0%
cases so would it be easier for you to
work

07:14:38.530 --> 07:14:38.540 align:start position:0%
work
 
07:14:41.510 --> 07:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
with with dollar constraints rather than
 
07:14:44.208 --> 07:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
Personnel constraints
 
07:14:44.218 --> 07:14:47.708 align:start position:0%
Personnel constraints
yes

07:14:47.708 --> 07:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:50.770 --> 07:14:50.780 align:start position:0%
so so the question that representative
 
07:14:54.288 --> 07:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
Rays though is if we put in a dollar
 
07:14:56.390 --> 07:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
amount without being able to back it up
 
07:15:00.410 --> 07:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
with some sort of change in operations
 
07:15:03.948 --> 07:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
that I guess by protocol is frowned upon
 
07:15:07.070 --> 07:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
and and and and and and and and not is
 
07:15:10.788 --> 07:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
respected in the other body so so
 
07:15:13.730 --> 07:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
completely disjointing these two things
 
07:15:16.030 --> 07:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
and just doing the money it probably
 
07:15:20.350 --> 07:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
exposes the money part of it to uh easy
 
07:15:24.708 --> 07:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
being assailed easily so I think that's
 
07:15:27.530 --> 07:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
what I heard representative Weiler
 
07:15:29.750 --> 07:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's been a few years since I walked
 
07:15:31.490 --> 07:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
around your offices in the various
 
07:15:31.500 --> 07:15:32.448 align:start position:0%
around your offices in the various
buildings

07:15:32.448 --> 07:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
07:15:35.990 --> 07:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
but even when it was back around 2200
 
07:15:38.150 --> 07:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
2300 employees
 
07:15:39.830 --> 07:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we said you could go to three
 
07:15:39.840 --> 07:15:40.788 align:start position:0%
and we said you could go to three
thousand

07:15:40.788 --> 07:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
07:15:42.468 --> 07:15:42.478 align:start position:0%
I don't see how you could have done that
 
07:15:42.478 --> 07:15:43.670 align:start position:0%
I don't see how you could have done that
without

07:15:43.670 --> 07:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
without
 
07:15:45.830 --> 07:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
leasing another building
 
07:15:47.930 --> 07:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
have you had any more buildings in the
 
07:15:51.350 --> 07:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
last couple of years so DHHS has
 
07:15:54.410 --> 07:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
embraced uh the the technology that that
 
07:15:57.048 --> 07:15:57.058 align:start position:0%
came available during the pandemic and
 
07:16:00.410 --> 07:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
most areas use a hybrid model so before
 
07:16:02.990 --> 07:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
I took this role I was running the
 
07:16:05.270 --> 07:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
contracts Bureau and what we did there
 
07:16:07.190 --> 07:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
is we actually implemented death share
 
07:16:09.230 --> 07:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
programs so that people would share
 
07:16:11.030 --> 07:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
desks some would be in certain days
 
07:16:13.190 --> 07:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
someone be in other days to try to take
 
07:16:16.250 --> 07:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
advantage both of the of really the
 
07:16:17.690 --> 07:16:17.700 align:start position:0%
benefit of of
 
07:16:19.128 --> 07:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
um you know staff morale and retention
 
07:16:20.990 --> 07:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
with those programs but then also just
 
07:16:22.128 --> 07:16:22.138 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that we do have
 
07:16:23.750 --> 07:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
limited space and that's how we've been
 
07:16:25.430 --> 07:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
able to do that and dphs has been doing
 
07:16:30.890 --> 07:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:34.548 --> 07:16:34.558 align:start position:0%
representative Holt thank you so I guess
 
07:16:34.558 --> 07:16:39.288 align:start position:0%
representative Holt thank you so I guess
oops

07:16:39.288 --> 07:16:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:41.810 --> 07:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Waller we
 
07:16:44.330 --> 07:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative hole is deferring to him
 
07:16:44.340 --> 07:16:45.708 align:start position:0%
representative hole is deferring to him
okay

07:16:45.708 --> 07:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:16:45.718 --> 07:16:46.850 align:start position:0%
okay
um

07:16:46.850 --> 07:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:16:49.788 --> 07:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
I guess I I know you reviewed this and I
 
07:16:51.708 --> 07:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
want to review it one more time so I
 
07:16:53.330 --> 07:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
have it
 
07:16:56.270 --> 07:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
straight in my head when we do a back of
 
07:16:58.490 --> 07:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
the budget cut like this whether it's
 
07:17:01.190 --> 07:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
Personnel or just an open-ended back of
 
07:17:02.628 --> 07:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
07:17:06.788 --> 07:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
we risk losing federal funds
 
07:17:11.628 --> 07:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
often it's a 50 50 so 23 million becomes
 
07:17:13.850 --> 07:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
really 46 or
 
07:17:16.128 --> 07:17:16.138 align:start position:0%
maybe somewhat less depending on the
 
07:17:18.890 --> 07:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
match of whatever you decide to reduce
 
07:17:20.510 --> 07:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
the budget by so
 
07:17:22.128 --> 07:17:22.138 align:start position:0%
that service
 
07:17:25.190 --> 07:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
to our to our citizens we're losing 50
 
07:17:26.990 --> 07:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
million close to 50 million dollars
 
07:17:28.910 --> 07:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
worth of service
 
07:17:31.070 --> 07:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I know you and I talked about this
 
07:17:33.530 --> 07:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
and I think you just alluded to it but
 
07:17:35.750 --> 07:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
in every budget in the last several
 
07:17:35.760 --> 07:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
in every budget in the last several
bienniums

07:17:37.430 --> 07:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
bienniums
 
07:17:40.670 --> 07:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
there has been a lapse requirement
 
07:17:43.850 --> 07:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
how much lapse requirement have you had
 
07:17:47.150 --> 07:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
on top of these back of the budgets
 
07:17:49.968 --> 07:17:49.978 align:start position:0%
which also means you'll be probably
 
07:17:52.270 --> 07:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
losing federal funds
 
07:17:55.968 --> 07:17:55.978 align:start position:0%
sure so so as I indicated earlier
 
07:17:57.948 --> 07:17:57.958 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
07:18:00.590 --> 07:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
um so the lapse is technically in the
 
07:18:02.810 --> 07:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement it's not in hb1 it's
 
07:18:04.670 --> 07:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
not an hb2 it's the assumptions upon
 
07:18:07.310 --> 07:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
which the legislature uh balances the
 
07:18:07.320 --> 07:18:08.208 align:start position:0%
which the legislature uh balances the
budget

07:18:08.208 --> 07:18:08.218 align:start position:0%
budget
 
07:18:11.448 --> 07:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
um in 22 the LA the the total lapse for
 
07:18:14.270 --> 07:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
the uh state was 64.8 million dollars in
 
07:18:15.830 --> 07:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the general education trust fund and
 
07:18:19.730 --> 07:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
89.5 in state fiscal year 23 and so you
 
07:18:21.490 --> 07:18:21.500 align:start position:0%
take half of that and that's what's been
 
07:18:24.948 --> 07:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
expected from DHHS
 
07:18:28.788 --> 07:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
so you had to lapse on top of the back
 
07:18:29.930 --> 07:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
07:18:34.250 --> 07:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
you had to lapse an additional 32
 
07:18:37.250 --> 07:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
and an additional 45.
 
07:18:39.468 --> 07:18:39.478 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that's been the general
 
07:18:41.090 --> 07:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
expectation yes
 
07:18:41.100 --> 07:18:43.610 align:start position:0%
expectation yes
and

07:18:43.610 --> 07:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:18:45.230 --> 07:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
most of that
 
07:18:50.990 --> 07:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:51.000 --> 07:18:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:18:51.830 --> 07:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:55.490 --> 07:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
so it it certainly could I I think one
 
07:18:57.708 --> 07:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
thing just to recognize is that if we do
 
07:18:59.930 --> 07:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
receive federal funds or we do receive
 
07:19:02.510 --> 07:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
an appropriation of General funds to
 
07:19:04.610 --> 07:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
implement a program if we if we don't
 
07:19:07.250 --> 07:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
have the Personnel available or we can't
 
07:19:09.170 --> 07:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
fill those personnel and we can't spend
 
07:19:10.788 --> 07:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
those dollars we may either lose that
 
07:19:13.730 --> 07:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
match or we may actually not spend the
 
07:19:15.230 --> 07:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
federal dollars or the general fund
 
07:19:16.670 --> 07:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation lapse that back to the
 
07:19:18.948 --> 07:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
federal government or lapse that back to
 
07:19:20.750 --> 07:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund coffers
 
07:19:24.350 --> 07:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
so we lose it and we end up losing it in
 
07:19:28.548 --> 07:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
both Federal and general fund services
 
07:19:30.770 --> 07:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
one way or another
 
07:19:33.948 --> 07:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
thank you well let me just challenge
 
07:19:38.090 --> 07:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
that that logic for just a moment though
 
07:19:38.100 --> 07:19:39.170 align:start position:0%
that that logic for just a moment though
um

07:19:39.170 --> 07:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:40.968 --> 07:19:40.978 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
07:19:43.070 --> 07:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
we have a limit on how much General
 
07:19:45.468 --> 07:19:45.478 align:start position:0%
funds that we're even able to spend well
 
07:19:48.830 --> 07:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
there you know if the theory was that
 
07:19:51.590 --> 07:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
every dollar in general funds that we
 
07:19:53.208 --> 07:19:53.218 align:start position:0%
spend that we're going to get more
 
07:19:56.230 --> 07:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
Federal money we we could go to infinity
 
07:19:59.448 --> 07:19:59.458 align:start position:0%
and the general funds and get infinity
 
07:20:03.048 --> 07:20:03.058 align:start position:0%
times 2 back from the feds so there is
 
07:20:05.930 --> 07:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
some natural upper limit to how many
 
07:20:08.208 --> 07:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
General funds we can invest
 
07:20:12.350 --> 07:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
we know that right now the governor's
 
07:20:15.048 --> 07:20:15.058 align:start position:0%
budget is counting on more Revenue than
 
07:20:17.090 --> 07:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
we are projecting at this point and
 
07:20:18.770 --> 07:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
we're getting warning signs from the
 
07:20:20.930 --> 07:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
Senate that it's going to be even lower
 
07:20:23.690 --> 07:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
than the house version so somewhere
 
07:20:26.628 --> 07:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
along the line we have to worry about
 
07:20:29.270 --> 07:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
where our general funds are going
 
07:20:31.850 --> 07:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be losing if we if we
 
07:20:34.810 --> 07:20:34.820 align:start position:0%
if we take this
 
07:20:37.010 --> 07:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
23.4 million
 
07:20:39.230 --> 07:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think we're gonna we're trying to move
 
07:20:43.610 --> 07:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
it over to the the Medicaid rate
 
07:20:43.620 --> 07:20:45.350 align:start position:0%
it over to the the Medicaid rate
targeting

07:20:45.350 --> 07:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
targeting
 
07:20:47.990 --> 07:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
if we're in the Medicaid rate targeting
 
07:20:51.170 --> 07:20:51.180 align:start position:0%
we may actually get reimbursed at this
 
07:20:53.510 --> 07:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
the same level we would have if it had
 
07:20:55.548 --> 07:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
been in this account but we may actually
 
07:20:58.548 --> 07:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
get a higher yield from the feds by
 
07:21:00.230 --> 07:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
putting it through Medicaid rate
 
07:21:03.530 --> 07:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
expansion so so so the part of your
 
07:21:05.868 --> 07:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
argument I'm challenging is that we're
 
07:21:08.270 --> 07:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to lose Federal money
 
07:21:11.090 --> 07:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're just going to get the same or more
 
07:21:12.890 --> 07:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
Federal money by putting it into
 
07:21:12.900 --> 07:21:14.530 align:start position:0%
Federal money by putting it into
Medicaid

07:21:14.530 --> 07:21:14.540 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
07:21:19.070 --> 07:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
tax rate or excuse me rate hikes than if
 
07:21:23.930 --> 07:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
we kept it in headquarters people
 
07:21:25.250 --> 07:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
07:21:27.350 --> 07:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative Wyler
 
07:21:30.110 --> 07:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
many of the items we see in fiscal
 
07:21:34.548 --> 07:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
are moving the date of a of a Federal
 
07:21:34.558 --> 07:21:35.750 align:start position:0%
are moving the date of a of a Federal
Grant

07:21:35.750 --> 07:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
07:21:37.610 --> 07:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
oh so so we're going to give it another
 
07:21:40.548 --> 07:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
year or so so if if we move money out of
 
07:21:42.530 --> 07:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
something that was going to be a Federal
 
07:21:44.510 --> 07:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
grant we didn't get to use it up at this
 
07:21:47.510 --> 07:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
at the rate we thought we would we quite
 
07:21:49.788 --> 07:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
often the feds let us keep it and move
 
07:21:52.010 --> 07:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
it to another year so a lot of this
 
07:21:54.230 --> 07:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
losing all these federal funds doesn't
 
07:21:56.270 --> 07:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
happen they've already written off the
 
07:21:58.968 --> 07:21:58.978 align:start position:0%
funds they sent to us and give us more
 
07:22:01.430 --> 07:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
time to spend them that's why we have so
 
07:22:04.128 --> 07:22:04.138 align:start position:0%
many items in fiscal saying the lap
 
07:22:06.350 --> 07:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
State shall be changed to such and such
 
07:22:09.110 --> 07:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
see that all the time thank you who is
 
07:22:10.430 --> 07:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
next representative
 
07:22:16.010 --> 07:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
we're not losing any federal funds match
 
07:22:18.770 --> 07:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
because these positions that were
 
07:22:21.110 --> 07:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
reducing the funding for are not going
 
07:22:23.208 --> 07:22:23.218 align:start position:0%
to be filled as I said this has nothing
 
07:22:25.310 --> 07:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
to do with covid these positions have
 
07:22:32.468 --> 07:22:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:36.170 --> 07:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
the the ceiling of 3000 is the same as
 
07:22:39.230 --> 07:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
the ceiling in this past budget so so
 
07:22:41.750 --> 07:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is not money that got spent in the
 
07:22:44.030 --> 07:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
last budget and and we this would just
 
07:22:46.190 --> 07:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
continue it into the next budget so
 
07:22:48.170 --> 07:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
there's kind of no change at that level
 
07:22:48.180 --> 07:22:49.788 align:start position:0%
there's kind of no change at that level
we're

07:22:49.788 --> 07:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
we're
 
07:22:51.468 --> 07:22:51.478 align:start position:0%
was was there another over here
 
07:22:55.490 --> 07:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:58.208 --> 07:22:58.218 align:start position:0%
sure comparing the differences between
 
07:23:02.750 --> 07:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
927 and 1149 right and this is to to Mr
 
07:23:02.760 --> 07:23:04.010 align:start position:0%
927 and 1149 right and this is to to Mr
White

07:23:04.010 --> 07:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
White
 
07:23:05.810 --> 07:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
if I heard him correctly he'd rather
 
07:23:08.810 --> 07:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
have a dollar value than us kind of
 
07:23:11.448 --> 07:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
meddling with full-time
 
07:23:13.788 --> 07:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
temporary part-time temporary positions
 
07:23:16.368 --> 07:23:16.378 align:start position:0%
I guess my question for him is
 
07:23:19.310 --> 07:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
if we kept the 27.9
 
07:23:22.430 --> 07:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
as the cost reduction
 
07:23:24.230 --> 07:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
and allowed it to go to Personnel
 
07:23:27.230 --> 07:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
related class but expanded line six
 
07:23:30.170 --> 07:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
in 927 to Personnel related class
 
07:23:33.530 --> 07:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
reductions and and maybe contract
 
07:23:36.650 --> 07:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
and then use the explanation of deleting
 
07:23:40.610 --> 07:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
the 213 unfilled right for some period
 
07:23:42.530 --> 07:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
of time positions as part of the
 
07:23:46.010 --> 07:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
justification could you accept that
 
07:23:48.170 --> 07:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
right I guess I'm making a change said
 
07:23:51.770 --> 07:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
another way to 927 of increasing Line 6
 
07:23:53.830 --> 07:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
to 27 9.
 
07:23:57.468 --> 07:23:57.478 align:start position:0%
and allowing you beyond just personnel
 
07:23:59.930 --> 07:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
class lines maybe some additional places
 
07:24:01.968 --> 07:24:01.978 align:start position:0%
you could go in contracts to find that
 
07:24:01.978 --> 07:24:07.090 align:start position:0%
you could go in contracts to find that
money

07:24:07.090 --> 07:24:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:08.770 --> 07:24:08.780 align:start position:0%
so so
 
07:24:12.650 --> 07:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
you you just to clarify So you you're
 
07:24:17.510 --> 07:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:20.208 --> 07:24:20.218 align:start position:0%
like that that I'm okay so we can use
 
07:24:22.330 --> 07:24:22.340 align:start position:0%
either one as the Baseline if we use
 
07:24:25.850 --> 07:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
11.40 no we can't we're talking about uh
 
07:24:28.730 --> 07:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
927 all the conversations okay so let's
 
07:24:31.730 --> 07:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
use 927. okay right change line six to
 
07:24:31.740 --> 07:24:34.128 align:start position:0%
use 927. okay right change line six to
27.9

07:24:34.128 --> 07:24:34.138 align:start position:0%
27.9
 
07:24:38.330 --> 07:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
but change also on line six
 
07:24:41.510 --> 07:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
that the reduction could be Beyond just
 
07:24:44.628 --> 07:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
Personnel related class lines
 
07:24:47.810 --> 07:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
to allow you some contract lines to have
 
07:24:49.910 --> 07:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
access to because you might find savings
 
07:24:49.920 --> 07:24:51.708 align:start position:0%
access to because you might find savings
there

07:24:51.708 --> 07:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:24:54.048 --> 07:24:54.058 align:start position:0%
so you're going to increase the amount
 
07:24:56.208 --> 07:24:56.218 align:start position:0%
that we have to lapse
 
07:24:58.250 --> 07:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
with the flexibility that it can come
 
07:25:01.310 --> 07:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
from other places correct I I honestly
 
07:25:04.448 --> 07:25:04.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:07.490 --> 07:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's I I mean I would probably need to
 
07:25:09.530 --> 07:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
speak with a commissioner about that
 
07:25:11.510 --> 07:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
option I I mean I don't think either one
 
07:25:15.288 --> 07:25:15.298 align:start position:0%
is a great option and moreover the
 
07:25:18.110 --> 07:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
the 200 the 3000
 
07:25:21.288 --> 07:25:21.298 align:start position:0%
position count it it's it's fairly it's
 
07:25:23.868 --> 07:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
not it's not meaningful because when
 
07:25:25.968 --> 07:25:25.978 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 27 million or 24
 
07:25:28.070 --> 07:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds again
 
07:25:30.590 --> 07:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
most of those positions are 50 50 and
 
07:25:32.570 --> 07:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot more than 3 000
 
07:25:35.510 --> 07:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
like like it's I I quick math it's
 
07:25:37.850 --> 07:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
probably closer to 2 800 that we
 
07:25:40.430 --> 07:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to fund so so the I I
 
07:25:42.048 --> 07:25:42.058 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
07:25:43.910 --> 07:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
I I I think
 
07:25:46.070 --> 07:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
the most benefit comes from focusing on
 
07:25:48.948 --> 07:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount of of what we of what
 
07:25:51.350 --> 07:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
you want to do there
 
07:25:53.810 --> 07:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I think my position is is
 
07:25:55.250 --> 07:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
pretty clear it's gonna it's going to
 
07:25:57.708 --> 07:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
hurt us one way or another it's just to
 
07:25:59.930 --> 07:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
the extent that it does because as
 
07:26:02.208 --> 07:26:02.218 align:start position:0%
representative walner pointed out
 
07:26:05.090 --> 07:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
we still have to find whatever the lapse
 
07:26:07.010 --> 07:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
ends up being you know whether the
 
07:26:08.750 --> 07:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
whether the committee conference assumes
 
07:26:10.128 --> 07:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
two percent or three percent or four
 
07:26:10.138 --> 07:26:11.090 align:start position:0%
two percent or three percent or four
percent

07:26:11.090 --> 07:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
percent
 
07:26:13.190 --> 07:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
all those contract dollars that aren't
 
07:26:14.990 --> 07:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
spent are still going to probably need
 
07:26:17.810 --> 07:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
to go towards that lap so if if we have
 
07:26:20.208 --> 07:26:20.218 align:start position:0%
the back of the budget cut and the labs
 
07:26:22.670 --> 07:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
whether there's flexibility here or
 
07:26:25.010 --> 07:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
flexibility on the laps we're going to
 
07:26:27.350 --> 07:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
have to intentionally hold positions
 
07:26:29.810 --> 07:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
vacant one way or another
 
07:26:32.448 --> 07:26:32.458 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple what is the current lapse in
 
07:26:34.730 --> 07:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
hb2 do you remember
 
07:26:34.740 --> 07:26:35.890 align:start position:0%
hb2 do you remember
foreign

07:26:35.890 --> 07:26:35.900 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:26:37.788 --> 07:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
well there's a back of the budget
 
07:26:39.830 --> 07:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in the current House Bill one
 
07:26:41.990 --> 07:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
of 22.6 million that's related to
 
07:26:44.150 --> 07:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
Personnel glass lines
 
07:26:46.548 --> 07:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
but if unless I'm mistaken there's no
 
07:26:49.430 --> 07:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
lapse called for in the current budget
 
07:26:51.468 --> 07:26:51.478 align:start position:0%
is that right that's correct the lapse
 
07:26:53.390 --> 07:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
is not the lapse expectation is not
 
07:26:55.310 --> 07:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
written into law right so we did not
 
07:26:58.070 --> 07:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
require a lapse we did just the yeah
 
07:26:59.810 --> 07:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
back of the budget reduction of
 
07:27:03.468 --> 07:27:03.478 align:start position:0%
full-time permanent positions correct
 
07:27:05.628 --> 07:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
but but the way that the Surplus
 
07:27:07.250 --> 07:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
statement has historically been
 
07:27:08.690 --> 07:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
interpreted even though it's not
 
07:27:10.368 --> 07:27:10.378 align:start position:0%
technically part of state law that's
 
07:27:12.708 --> 07:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
That's the basis upon which the
 
07:27:14.390 --> 07:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
Department administrative services and
 
07:27:17.150 --> 07:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's office looks to DHHS and
 
07:27:19.490 --> 07:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
other agencies when they're looking for
 
07:27:25.030 --> 07:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:29.030 --> 07:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's on you so to speak not on us the
 
07:27:31.310 --> 07:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
the the reason again going back to the
 
07:27:33.048 --> 07:27:33.058 align:start position:0%
reason of this is not just to say we
 
07:27:34.968 --> 07:27:34.978 align:start position:0%
want elapse money it's to say let's
 
07:27:37.490 --> 07:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
release these General funds so we can
 
07:27:39.830 --> 07:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
apply them into the Medicaid rates and
 
07:27:41.448 --> 07:27:41.458 align:start position:0%
hopefully get above that 40 million
 
07:27:43.788 --> 07:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
dollar uh threshold we're talking about
 
07:27:45.530 --> 07:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid rate increases 40 million
 
07:27:46.788 --> 07:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
dollars per year for Medicare rate
 
07:27:46.798 --> 07:27:57.530 align:start position:0%
dollars per year for Medicare rate
increases

07:27:57.530 --> 07:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:01.128 --> 07:28:01.138 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'd propose that we move 927
 
07:28:05.090 --> 07:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
hotel as we have in front of us
 
07:28:07.910 --> 07:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
07:28:11.150 --> 07:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative Norton
 
07:28:13.070 --> 07:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
effect sure okay
 
07:28:16.910 --> 07:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:19.968 --> 07:33:19.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:33.770 --> 07:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:35.750 --> 07:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
this one was actually close to five
 
07:33:35.760 --> 07:33:39.468 align:start position:0%
this one was actually close to five
minutes

07:33:39.468 --> 07:33:39.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:39.478 --> 07:33:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

07:33:41.990 --> 07:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:33:43.548 --> 07:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:33:47.150 --> 07:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
um we're we're back out of recess uh
 
07:33:49.788 --> 07:33:49.798 align:start position:0%
representative erf would you would you
 
07:33:52.128 --> 07:33:52.138 align:start position:0%
would you bring us up to speed on uh
 
07:33:54.410 --> 07:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to zero nine two
 
07:33:56.628 --> 07:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
seven so Mr Ripple is actually working
 
07:33:58.548 --> 07:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
on a clean version so you all can read
 
07:34:01.548 --> 07:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
it but here's and I discussed this with
 
07:34:02.930 --> 07:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
Mr White as well
 
07:34:05.628 --> 07:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
so looking at 927
 
07:34:08.628 --> 07:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
starting towards the end of line five
 
07:34:10.490 --> 07:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
whereas that is hereby directed to
 
07:34:14.090 --> 07:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
reduce Personnel related class lines
 
07:34:17.390 --> 07:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
change that to is hereby director to
 
07:34:22.010 --> 07:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
reduce state general fund Appropriations
 
07:34:24.948 --> 07:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
by same amount and then delete in
 
07:34:26.270 --> 07:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
general funds because the GF is
 
07:34:28.250 --> 07:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the Clause before
 
07:34:31.368 --> 07:34:31.378 align:start position:0%
for the biennium ending June 30 2025 and
 
07:34:31.378 --> 07:34:32.230 align:start position:0%
for the biennium ending June 30 2025 and
then

07:34:32.230 --> 07:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:34:34.548 --> 07:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
on line seven to lead all the way up to
 
07:34:36.170 --> 07:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
the period so that so the period would
 
07:34:38.208 --> 07:34:38.218 align:start position:0%
fall at the end of line six
 
07:34:42.048 --> 07:34:42.058 align:start position:0%
the 3000 limit would still apply
 
07:34:43.850 --> 07:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't be directed for the
 
07:34:45.770 --> 07:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
funding to come out of the
 
07:34:48.590 --> 07:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
full-time person full-time permanent
 
07:34:50.930 --> 07:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
Personnel loans
 
07:34:54.288 --> 07:34:54.298 align:start position:0%
first of all does that just make sense
 
07:34:56.510 --> 07:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
does everybody understand the word to
 
07:34:58.610 --> 07:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
rep or Mr Ripple it looks like you want
 
07:35:04.730 --> 07:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:06.170 --> 07:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
um no
 
07:35:08.810 --> 07:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
I can I can make copies of what
 
07:35:10.490 --> 07:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Earth just described if
 
07:35:11.628 --> 07:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
you're willing to tolerate my
 
07:35:16.788 --> 07:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
handwritten scroll let's do that okay
 
07:35:16.798 --> 07:35:18.430 align:start position:0%
handwritten scroll let's do that okay
so

07:35:18.430 --> 07:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:35:21.530 --> 07:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
the idea is to provide more flexibility
 
07:35:21.540 --> 07:35:22.730 align:start position:0%
the idea is to provide more flexibility
to

07:35:22.730 --> 07:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:35:24.468 --> 07:35:24.478 align:start position:0%
the department
 
07:35:26.628 --> 07:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
while still being specific about what
 
07:35:28.128 --> 07:35:28.138 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish
 
07:35:29.690 --> 07:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
and hopefully still being able to use
 
07:35:32.930 --> 07:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
these funds to apply to the Medicaid
 
07:35:35.270 --> 07:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh rate
 
07:35:37.610 --> 07:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
um increases
 
07:35:38.990 --> 07:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
07:35:42.170 --> 07:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is the intent intent to
 
07:35:44.150 --> 07:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
um just have that so we can look at it
 
07:35:47.090 --> 07:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
are we going to vote from a him I'm
 
07:35:49.070 --> 07:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
feeling like I'm going to vote on it but
 
07:35:51.650 --> 07:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
to vote on it I want you to be able to
 
07:35:54.230 --> 07:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
see exactly what just got verbally
 
07:35:54.240 --> 07:35:56.510 align:start position:0%
see exactly what just got verbally
described

07:35:56.510 --> 07:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
described
 
07:35:58.548 --> 07:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know the part that's not
 
07:36:00.890 --> 07:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
going to be written is our intent is
 
07:36:02.570 --> 07:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
we're looking for money
 
07:36:07.250 --> 07:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
to move into a higher priority to I
 
07:36:11.990 --> 07:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
think of uh Inc increasing the Medicaid
 
07:36:14.990 --> 07:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
rate hikes
 
07:36:17.510 --> 07:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
because I think our number one problem
 
07:36:19.250 --> 07:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
in the state from a health care
 
07:36:22.968 --> 07:36:22.978 align:start position:0%
perspective is the ER boarding that's
 
07:36:25.788 --> 07:36:25.798 align:start position:0%
the symptom of a tremendous amount of
 
07:36:28.310 --> 07:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
dysfunction throughout the state to the
 
07:36:30.890 --> 07:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
extent that we can address that we
 
07:36:33.530 --> 07:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
should be a healthier happier state so
 
07:36:35.990 --> 07:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying if I can going to spend
 
07:36:38.868 --> 07:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
money on Personnel in the department
 
07:36:38.878 --> 07:36:40.090 align:start position:0%
money on Personnel in the department
versus

07:36:40.090 --> 07:36:40.100 align:start position:0%
versus
 
07:36:43.910 --> 07:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid money to build out the delivery
 
07:36:46.968 --> 07:36:46.978 align:start position:0%
system I I think where we're at I I
 
07:36:48.830 --> 07:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
would prioritize building out the
 
07:36:51.110 --> 07:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
delivery system
 
07:36:51.120 --> 07:37:27.310 align:start position:0%
delivery system
foreign

07:37:27.310 --> 07:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:29.690 --> 07:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
you haven't gotten any sort of update
 
07:37:56.030 --> 07:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:59.030 --> 07:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
to so I would just observe that that
 
07:38:01.128 --> 07:38:01.138 align:start position:0%
this language initially came from what
 
07:38:03.410 --> 07:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
what we did in hb2
 
07:38:05.990 --> 07:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
basically word for word with what we did
 
07:38:08.270 --> 07:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
in hb2 last term
 
07:38:11.810 --> 07:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
and with these changes that
 
07:38:14.510 --> 07:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative verf is proposing this
 
07:38:17.090 --> 07:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
actually is more permissive than what we
 
07:38:27.048 --> 07:38:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:29.448 --> 07:38:29.458 align:start position:0%
so I think everyone's had an opportunity
 
07:38:32.030 --> 07:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
to read this language I I don't think
 
07:38:34.548 --> 07:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
it's changed anyone's positions except I
 
07:38:36.468 --> 07:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
think it's made
 
07:38:39.048 --> 07:38:39.058 align:start position:0%
the prevailing position probably more
 
07:38:42.670 --> 07:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:46.730 --> 07:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
so if there's no further discussion I'll
 
07:38:48.770 --> 07:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go ahead and take a straw
 
07:38:50.948 --> 07:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
07:38:55.548 --> 07:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
all in favor of accepting zero nine two
 
07:38:58.128 --> 07:38:58.138 align:start position:0%
seven with the handwritten changes done
 
07:39:02.750 --> 07:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:02.760 --> 07:39:05.208 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

07:39:05.208 --> 07:39:05.218 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
07:39:13.788 --> 07:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:17.030 --> 07:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
so so somebody everybody should check me
 
07:39:18.830 --> 07:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
because I think
 
07:39:22.910 --> 07:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're down to one last item and that is
 
07:39:25.850 --> 07:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid rate
 
07:39:28.548 --> 07:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
targeted rate hikes
 
07:39:30.288 --> 07:39:30.298 align:start position:0%
that's the last issue is there anything
 
07:39:33.288 --> 07:39:33.298 align:start position:0%
else I still have my Amendment hanging
 
07:39:35.270 --> 07:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
out there in The Ether
 
07:39:35.280 --> 07:39:36.590 align:start position:0%
out there in The Ether
oh

07:39:36.590 --> 07:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
07:39:44.448 --> 07:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:49.070 --> 07:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:52.368 --> 07:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
oh okay so so
 
07:39:54.708 --> 07:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
um look for representative tolerski's
 
07:39:59.990 --> 07:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment it was basically adding 625
 
07:40:05.350 --> 07:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:08.810 --> 07:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
do you recall the number 8 it's an HP
 
07:40:11.390 --> 07:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:14.990 --> 07:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's an HB one Amendment oh HP one okay
 
07:40:18.048 --> 07:40:18.058 align:start position:0%
a list of five Regional
 
07:40:18.058 --> 07:40:34.868 align:start position:0%
a list of five Regional
groups

07:40:34.868 --> 07:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:38.270 --> 07:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
oh I have one I actually found a piece
 
07:40:42.128 --> 07:40:42.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:44.030 --> 07:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:40:44.040 --> 07:40:45.530 align:start position:0%
all right
so

07:40:45.530 --> 07:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:40:47.868 --> 07:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
this is representative tolerski's
 
07:40:47.878 --> 07:40:50.690 align:start position:0%
this is representative tolerski's
proposal

07:40:50.690 --> 07:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:55.690 --> 07:40:55.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:57.948 --> 07:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr chair
 
07:40:59.750 --> 07:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if perhaps we could reduce
 
07:41:01.910 --> 07:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the amount considering the circumstance
 
07:41:03.350 --> 07:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
07:41:06.468 --> 07:41:06.478 align:start position:0%
to forty thousand dollars per
 
07:41:06.478 --> 07:41:08.448 align:start position:0%
to forty thousand dollars per
organization

07:41:08.448 --> 07:41:08.458 align:start position:0%
organization
 
07:41:10.070 --> 07:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
listed here
 
07:41:14.570 --> 07:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:17.810 --> 07:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
so we're changing the the proposed
 
07:41:21.770 --> 07:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
change of 625 to 200.
 
07:41:21.780 --> 07:41:23.990 align:start position:0%
change of 625 to 200.
correct

07:41:23.990 --> 07:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
07:41:26.690 --> 07:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
that's my motion
 
07:41:31.190 --> 07:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
any any discussion on that proposal
 
07:41:34.090 --> 07:41:34.100 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we're gonna
 
07:41:36.288 --> 07:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
I was just going to say I was planning
 
07:41:38.030 --> 07:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
to vote against it but at this level I
 
07:41:40.670 --> 07:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
think I support it
 
07:41:43.070 --> 07:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
so your your opposition I'm just curious
 
07:41:46.330 --> 07:41:46.340 align:start position:0%
about what your opposition was at 625.
 
07:41:50.570 --> 07:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
well it it's just that it's uh it you
 
07:41:53.590 --> 07:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
know it's a select group of of providers
 
07:41:55.730 --> 07:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
07:41:55.740 --> 07:41:56.628 align:start position:0%
and you know
um

07:41:56.628 --> 07:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:41:58.368 --> 07:41:58.378 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
07:42:01.190 --> 07:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
kind of put out for wider distribution
 
07:42:04.070 --> 07:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's the right group or not but
 
07:42:06.110 --> 07:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
they have been fairly well organized and
 
07:42:08.990 --> 07:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
and they do good work so at this level
 
07:42:11.750 --> 07:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable putting some support in
 
07:42:14.510 --> 07:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for sharing that any
 
07:42:17.150 --> 07:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
other comments representative Weiler
 
07:42:19.490 --> 07:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
do these groups get any money from like
 
07:42:21.708 --> 07:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
United Fund or any of these other
 
07:42:26.208 --> 07:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:28.128 --> 07:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
I know that the United Way actually is
 
07:42:30.650 --> 07:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
the Fiscal Agent for the National
 
07:42:32.750 --> 07:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
Organization I don't know if that's all
 
07:42:34.330 --> 07:42:34.340 align:start position:0%
of them or not
 
07:42:37.190 --> 07:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you but but yesterday we had a
 
07:42:39.170 --> 07:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
discussion I think on the that there's
 
07:42:41.030 --> 07:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
some match money that the organization
 
07:42:43.368 --> 07:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
is going to attempt to solicit and that
 
07:42:46.490 --> 07:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
the match money is somehow meant to be
 
07:42:50.448 --> 07:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
um comparable to the general funds at
 
07:42:51.830 --> 07:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
least this is what I'm thinking I
 
07:42:53.990 --> 07:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
remember it was a little unclear I think
 
07:42:55.610 --> 07:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
after our conversation and looking at
 
07:42:57.288 --> 07:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
the questions it was unclear
 
07:42:59.090 --> 07:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
on the answer
 
07:43:01.910 --> 07:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay so being honest so so the part of
 
07:43:05.090 --> 07:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
it that is probably clear though is that
 
07:43:07.490 --> 07:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
there they have an internal expectation
 
07:43:08.750 --> 07:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they're going to go raise
 
07:43:11.708 --> 07:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
supplemental funds
 
07:43:14.930 --> 07:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
and I would assume the fact that they
 
07:43:16.490 --> 07:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
can say that they've gotten some general
 
07:43:19.968 --> 07:43:19.978 align:start position:0%
funding could help prime the pump for
 
07:43:22.850 --> 07:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
their fundraising if if they Market it
 
07:43:24.468 --> 07:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
that way
 
07:43:28.490 --> 07:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
all right so uh all those in favor of
 
07:43:32.270 --> 07:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
accepting the the tolersky hb1 amendment
 
07:43:36.230 --> 07:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
at 200 000 versus 625 a year please
 
07:43:39.410 --> 07:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:39.420 --> 07:43:41.570 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

07:43:41.570 --> 07:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
07:43:41.580 --> 07:43:42.590 align:start position:0%
opposed
okay

07:43:42.590 --> 07:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:43:42.600 --> 07:43:47.390 align:start position:0%
okay
so

07:43:47.390 --> 07:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:54.590 --> 07:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:59.330 --> 07:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:00.830 --> 07:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:44:03.230 --> 07:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
so representative Mooney you handed me
 
07:44:05.570 --> 07:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
this for a reason and I'm not sure what
 
07:44:17.090 --> 07:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:20.570 --> 07:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's up to you so so we're discussing
 
07:44:22.968 --> 07:44:22.978 align:start position:0%
just so you know it says irf on it and
 
07:44:25.850 --> 07:44:25.860 align:start position:0%
it's an hb2 item
 
07:44:28.368 --> 07:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
and it's number
 
07:44:31.670 --> 07:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
is uh one zero five three
 
07:44:35.448 --> 07:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
it's related to construction funds
 
07:44:38.750 --> 07:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't think that we need to
 
07:44:42.230 --> 07:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
pick this up because what the finance
 
07:44:44.810 --> 07:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
committee passed and what the floor
 
07:44:48.048 --> 07:44:48.058 align:start position:0%
amendment is for this week
 
07:44:50.208 --> 07:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
I think has already taken care of the
 
07:44:52.010 --> 07:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
construction fund issue I don't I don't
 
07:44:53.690 --> 07:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
know that this adds anything because
 
07:44:56.090 --> 07:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass something
 
07:44:59.510 --> 07:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:02.510 --> 07:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
putting aside what happens
 
07:45:05.810 --> 07:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
on the floor or anytime this basically
 
07:45:07.850 --> 07:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
goes back to the
 
07:45:10.670 --> 07:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars of General funds
 
07:45:13.190 --> 07:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
which is currently in uh being taken
 
07:45:15.590 --> 07:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
pulled out of FY 23 it's
 
07:45:17.510 --> 07:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
I I didn't know if we voted on it or not
 
07:45:18.890 --> 07:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
voted on I'm trying to find it on the
 
07:45:18.900 --> 07:45:20.270 align:start position:0%
voted on I'm trying to find it on the
list

07:45:20.270 --> 07:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
list
 
07:45:20.280 --> 07:45:20.810 align:start position:0%
list
um

07:45:20.810 --> 07:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:45:22.548 --> 07:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
but but I know where it appears on my
 
07:45:25.190 --> 07:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
list I I thought we had voted it said
 
07:45:27.788 --> 07:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
someone to make everything come from
 
07:45:29.810 --> 07:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
I thought we voted on it too but if
 
07:45:31.730 --> 07:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
you're bringing it up maybe we didn't no
 
07:45:35.208 --> 07:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
I I I think the appropriation was 21.6
 
07:45:37.190 --> 07:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it was all meant to be arpa unless
 
07:45:39.530 --> 07:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
they ran out arpa in which case the
 
07:45:41.330 --> 07:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
governor would come back and request
 
07:45:44.270 --> 07:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
General funds but I note that on your or
 
07:45:46.250 --> 07:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
on the sheet that Mr Kane produced for
 
07:45:47.628 --> 07:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
us this morning he still shows the 10
 
07:45:50.030 --> 07:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
million sununu funny money on there you
 
07:45:52.430 --> 07:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
know that how he produces that
 
07:45:54.170 --> 07:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I thought he took off the 10 million
 
07:45:55.968 --> 07:45:55.978 align:start position:0%
for the sununu center
 
07:45:59.810 --> 07:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh however I think I think he was
 
07:46:02.868 --> 07:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
planning on carrying
 
07:46:05.930 --> 07:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
6.6 million in general funds uh if House
 
07:46:08.270 --> 07:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 becomes law assuming 15 million
 
07:46:15.048 --> 07:46:15.058 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:17.690 --> 07:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
so where it says 10 now we we'd strike
 
07:46:21.230 --> 07:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
through that and make it 6.6
 
07:46:23.690 --> 07:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
the well effectively yes the 10 would be
 
07:46:25.490 --> 07:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
removed and there'd be 6.6 million
 
07:46:28.368 --> 07:46:28.378 align:start position:0%
associated with house bill 49. and why
 
07:46:30.410 --> 07:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
is that
 
07:46:30.420 --> 07:46:32.570 align:start position:0%
is that
be

07:46:32.570 --> 07:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:46:35.750 --> 07:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's if you that's if you voted to uh
 
07:46:39.948 --> 07:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
undo Amendment 1053 that's
 
07:46:41.390 --> 07:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
oh is that we're voting dude to undo
 
07:46:43.330 --> 07:46:43.340 align:start position:0%
1053 now right now we're discussing
 
07:46:46.430 --> 07:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
1053. have we previously approved it
 
07:46:50.690 --> 07:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:50.700 --> 07:46:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:46:52.390 --> 07:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:46:58.430 --> 07:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
so I I it's it's backwards in my head
 
07:47:01.968 --> 07:47:01.978 align:start position:0%
I I am predisposed to thinking that 49
 
07:47:04.250 --> 07:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
in one way or another is going to pass
 
07:47:05.810 --> 07:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
the house and it's going to go to the
 
07:47:09.048 --> 07:47:09.058 align:start position:0%
Senate and the appropriation amount is
 
07:47:10.628 --> 07:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
going to remain
 
07:47:14.270 --> 07:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
21.6 with the use of arpa money first
 
07:47:17.990 --> 07:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
that any Gap can be picked up by General
 
07:47:18.000 --> 07:47:19.968 align:start position:0%
that any Gap can be picked up by General
funds

07:47:19.968 --> 07:47:19.978 align:start position:0%
funds
 
07:47:24.430 --> 07:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't we just put like
 
07:47:29.448 --> 07:47:29.458 align:start position:0%
6.6 of General funds into an hb1 budget
 
07:47:33.288 --> 07:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
line item so that we're not surprised if
 
07:47:35.150 --> 07:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
they have to come back from for General
 
07:47:38.030 --> 07:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
funds I I don't think you need to do
 
07:47:40.128 --> 07:47:40.138 align:start position:0%
that the Surplus statement that Mike
 
07:47:42.708 --> 07:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
Kane produces will show 6.6 million in
 
07:47:44.448 --> 07:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
general funds associated with house bill
 
07:47:46.910 --> 07:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
49. I think what representative erf's
 
07:47:48.830 --> 07:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment which was adopted previously
 
07:47:51.350 --> 07:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
was designed to do is eliminate the hit
 
07:47:53.448 --> 07:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
to the general fund At All by requiring
 
07:47:56.570 --> 07:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
that the entire 21.6 B arpa
 
07:47:59.090 --> 07:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with what ended up
 
07:48:01.430 --> 07:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the finance committee voted that
 
07:48:04.190 --> 07:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
out and the floor amendment is keeps the
 
07:48:07.390 --> 07:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
same language so so
 
07:48:11.208 --> 07:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
why why do we need this hb2 item
 
07:48:14.030 --> 07:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
the the language in House Bill 49 does
 
07:48:15.708 --> 07:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
not require that everything be General
 
07:48:17.750 --> 07:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
funds it allows the governor to use arpa
 
07:48:18.948 --> 07:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
to the
 
07:48:20.448 --> 07:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
sorry does not require that everything
 
07:48:22.190 --> 07:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
the arbor funds it allows the governor
 
07:48:24.048 --> 07:48:24.058 align:start position:0%
to use arpa funds to the extent
 
07:48:24.058 --> 07:48:26.030 align:start position:0%
to use arpa funds to the extent
available

07:48:26.030 --> 07:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
07:48:28.490 --> 07:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
this would require the exclusive use of
 
07:48:31.250 --> 07:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
arpa or federal
 
07:48:33.110 --> 07:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
I have to look up the exact language but
 
07:48:34.850 --> 07:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
it would require the exclusive use of
 
07:48:37.548 --> 07:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
arpa funds okay so what happens if he's
 
07:48:39.288 --> 07:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
out of arpa funds
 
07:48:41.330 --> 07:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
these General funds
 
07:48:43.788 --> 07:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
and and if this is in law what happens
 
07:48:46.250 --> 07:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
it reads including any funds which have
 
07:48:47.750 --> 07:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
previously been allocated by the
 
07:48:48.948 --> 07:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
governor but which have not been
 
07:48:51.948 --> 07:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
expended so if gopher had allocated arpa
 
07:48:53.510 --> 07:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
to a different purpose but they hadn't
 
07:48:55.128 --> 07:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
been spent the governor would have to
 
07:48:56.448 --> 07:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
find the money there
 
07:48:58.250 --> 07:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
what if he can
 
07:49:00.770 --> 07:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
and this is in the fact what what what
 
07:49:03.468 --> 07:49:03.478 align:start position:0%
happens then then there's there's no
 
07:49:03.478 --> 07:49:04.850 align:start position:0%
happens then then there's there's no
alternative

07:49:04.850 --> 07:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
07:49:06.770 --> 07:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's arpa or nothing under that
 
07:49:06.780 --> 07:49:07.628 align:start position:0%
it's arpa or nothing under that
Amendment

07:49:07.628 --> 07:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
07:49:10.010 --> 07:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
but more importantly I still don't
 
07:49:11.990 --> 07:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand why there would be some money
 
07:49:14.810 --> 07:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
left in general funds if this has
 
07:49:18.048 --> 07:49:18.058 align:start position:0%
already passed and been accounted for
 
07:49:21.230 --> 07:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be if 1053 remains
 
07:49:23.510 --> 07:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill 2 there would be no
 
07:49:25.490 --> 07:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
general fund expense associated with
 
07:49:27.350 --> 07:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
this new center replacement I I think
 
07:49:29.990 --> 07:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
the discussion is whether to keep 1053
 
07:49:32.868 --> 07:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
or do something else with it well that's
 
07:49:34.910 --> 07:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking I'm thinking that we
 
07:49:37.070 --> 07:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
we could recovery I don't know what
 
07:49:40.690 --> 07:49:40.700 align:start position:0%
value this is adding it keeps
 
07:49:43.910 --> 07:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
so new new funding General funds out of
 
07:49:45.288 --> 07:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
the budget so we have more money
 
07:49:47.510 --> 07:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
available more General funds available
 
07:49:49.730 --> 07:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
for what we're doing
 
07:49:52.250 --> 07:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the and this is what
 
07:49:54.530 --> 07:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
we I thought we'd already done all this
 
07:49:56.510 --> 07:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
but back to the
 
07:49:59.150 --> 07:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
um FY 23 Surplus
 
07:50:01.010 --> 07:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
there's a line in there for sonuna that
 
07:50:02.690 --> 07:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
says 10 million dollars
 
07:50:05.810 --> 07:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
and this that's General funds coming out
 
07:50:08.448 --> 07:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
of surplus right now this this year
 
07:50:11.628 --> 07:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
this took that away so that that goes to
 
07:50:13.788 --> 07:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
zero which frees up 10 million dollars
 
07:50:15.288 --> 07:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
of General funds along with what
 
07:50:16.190 --> 07:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
everything everything else we've been
 
07:50:17.810 --> 07:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
trying to free up here okay and we've
 
07:50:20.570 --> 07:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
already voted on this I thought so all
 
07:50:20.580 --> 07:50:22.610 align:start position:0%
already voted on this I thought so all
right

07:50:22.610 --> 07:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:50:26.388 --> 07:50:26.398 align:start position:0%
okay so just to clarify please make sure
 
07:50:27.590 --> 07:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
Mr King has removed it because I'm
 
07:50:28.910 --> 07:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's on today's version it
 
07:50:31.430 --> 07:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
was still there the 10 million
 
07:50:33.350 --> 07:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
I think he had a line associated with it
 
07:50:36.410 --> 07:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
but I think he showed it as a a division
 
07:50:38.208 --> 07:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
three savings compared to the governor's
 
07:50:40.730 --> 07:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
Original House Bill too
 
07:50:45.410 --> 07:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay so that topic came up because I'm
 
07:50:47.750 --> 07:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging everyone to take a look at
 
07:50:50.030 --> 07:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
all of their notes
 
07:50:53.030 --> 07:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
because I believe we've done everything
 
07:50:56.090 --> 07:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
except for the final thing on the
 
07:50:56.100 --> 07:50:57.110 align:start position:0%
except for the final thing on the
Medicaid

07:50:57.110 --> 07:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
07:51:01.128 --> 07:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:03.110 --> 07:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's that and there's one other item
 
07:51:04.610 --> 07:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to discuss with you if
 
07:51:06.170 --> 07:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
you're willing to take a five-minute
 
07:51:06.180 --> 07:51:07.910 align:start position:0%
you're willing to take a five-minute
recess

07:51:07.910 --> 07:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
recess
 
07:51:10.368 --> 07:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
we're in a five-minute recess
 
07:51:10.378 --> 07:51:22.010 align:start position:0%
we're in a five-minute recess
foreign

07:51:22.010 --> 07:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:22.020 --> 07:57:14.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:57:14.690 --> 07:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:16.490 --> 07:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
everybody's had an orange Lifesaver
 
07:57:19.150 --> 07:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
except for urban center Orange
 
07:57:22.910 --> 07:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
Lifesavers Okay so
 
07:57:25.070 --> 07:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go ahead and come out
 
07:57:26.628 --> 07:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
of recess
 
07:57:30.468 --> 07:57:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:32.990 --> 07:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
we are
 
07:57:35.448 --> 07:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
is this the first time we've looked as a
 
07:57:39.530 --> 07:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee uh at Medicaid expansion
 
07:57:41.270 --> 07:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
so this is we've talked about it a
 
07:57:42.770 --> 07:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
little bit but this is the first time
 
07:57:45.230 --> 07:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
we've seen it he uh Mr Ripple would you
 
07:57:49.070 --> 07:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:49.080 --> 07:57:55.128 align:start position:0%
 
.

07:57:55.128 --> 07:57:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:55.138 --> 07:57:57.948 align:start position:0%
 
laughs

07:57:57.948 --> 07:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
07:57:59.868 --> 07:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
why are we doing this instead of waiting
 
07:58:02.510 --> 07:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
for the Senate bill
 
07:58:04.730 --> 07:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
so that we have a house position because
 
07:58:06.830 --> 07:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
we've got a few things that we want to
 
07:58:09.170 --> 07:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
put stakes in the ground so that in a
 
07:58:11.030 --> 07:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee a conference our position is
 
07:58:11.040 --> 07:58:12.590 align:start position:0%
committee a conference our position is
known

07:58:12.590 --> 07:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
known
 
07:58:15.410 --> 07:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
and and Mr Ripple go through it so
 
07:58:18.350 --> 07:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
you'll you you may not agree one that we
 
07:58:20.270 --> 07:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
want those to be our house positions but
 
07:58:43.810 --> 07:58:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:48.048 --> 07:58:48.058 align:start position:0%
okay no do that I I'd appreciate an
 
07:58:50.628 --> 07:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
independent comparison so representative
 
07:58:52.910 --> 07:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
walner is running off to get her version
 
07:58:57.830 --> 07:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the Senate Medicaid expansion bill so
 
07:58:57.840 --> 08:01:07.850 align:start position:0%
of the Senate Medicaid expansion bill so
um

08:01:07.850 --> 08:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:07.860 --> 08:01:10.330 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

08:01:10.330 --> 08:01:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:31.610 --> 08:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:35.810 --> 08:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
the Senate primarily with some other
 
08:01:40.010 --> 08:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
house Geniuses looking at it to tweak it
 
08:01:42.170 --> 08:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
but it's it
 
08:01:46.030 --> 08:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:48.530 --> 08:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's representative Waller asks the
 
08:01:51.230 --> 08:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:53.930 --> 08:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's the answer to her is
 
08:01:56.510 --> 08:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
because if we don't do this the house
 
08:01:58.910 --> 08:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
does not have a position if we go into a
 
08:02:01.310 --> 08:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee a conference this established
 
08:02:03.048 --> 08:02:03.058 align:start position:0%
this if we pass this this would
 
08:02:05.868 --> 08:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
establish a house position on the
 
08:02:08.448 --> 08:02:08.458 align:start position:0%
committee a conference
 
08:02:10.788 --> 08:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
and so Mr Ripple would you go through
 
08:02:14.570 --> 08:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
and and I think the key thing you intend
 
08:02:17.150 --> 08:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
to highlight are the distinctions
 
08:02:19.430 --> 08:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
between this version and the Senate
 
08:02:20.868 --> 08:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
version or would do you think we ought
 
08:02:22.548 --> 08:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
to go through the whole thing I'll
 
08:02:24.170 --> 08:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
highlight the distinction between this
 
08:02:26.510 --> 08:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 263 as passed by the
 
08:02:28.128 --> 08:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
Senate all right
 
08:02:30.230 --> 08:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
so everything about the commission on
 
08:02:30.240 --> 08:02:31.430 align:start position:0%
so everything about the commission on
page

08:02:31.430 --> 08:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
page
 
08:02:36.530 --> 08:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:38.690 --> 08:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
um on page three
 
08:02:41.628 --> 08:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom section six you can
 
08:02:43.788 --> 08:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
see that it extends the repeal of the
 
08:02:46.250 --> 08:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
program not permanently as the Senate
 
08:02:48.288 --> 08:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
bill would do but until December 31st
 
08:02:50.448 --> 08:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
2025 so it extends it for another two
 
08:02:50.458 --> 08:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
2025 so it extends it for another two
years

08:02:55.910 --> 08:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:02:58.310 --> 08:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
everything else about this page is the
 
08:02:59.930 --> 08:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
same and it may look familiar because
 
08:03:01.548 --> 08:03:01.558 align:start position:0%
you've already passed all the other
 
08:03:03.530 --> 08:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
language on page three in the context of
 
08:03:05.388 --> 08:03:05.398 align:start position:0%
the alcohol fund amendment that the
 
08:03:11.868 --> 08:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:13.910 --> 08:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
08:03:16.070 --> 08:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
likewise there is some more language
 
08:03:17.690 --> 08:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
that was included in the earlier alcohol
 
08:03:19.548 --> 08:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
fund Amendment
 
08:03:23.208 --> 08:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
but on lines 12 and 13 there's bolded
 
08:03:25.250 --> 08:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
language that is not included in the
 
08:03:26.750 --> 08:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 263 that reads the
 
08:03:28.250 --> 08:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
department shall include the cost of the
 
08:03:30.170 --> 08:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
program and its biennial budget requests
 
08:03:33.170 --> 08:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
under rsa94 the intent of this is to
 
08:03:34.910 --> 08:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
require the program to appear in the
 
08:03:36.830 --> 08:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget going forward rather
 
08:03:40.190 --> 08:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
than be off budget as it currently is
 
08:03:42.708 --> 08:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
and and and that's in the next budget
 
08:03:44.750 --> 08:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
not this budget cycle that's correct it
 
08:03:47.628 --> 08:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
would first appear in 2627.
 
08:03:50.448 --> 08:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
and the other new language starting on
 
08:03:53.090 --> 08:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
line 21 uh Liquor Commission fund
 
08:03:55.548 --> 08:03:55.558 align:start position:0%
transfers this language was lifted
 
08:03:57.770 --> 08:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
directly from the alcohol fund amendment
 
08:04:00.230 --> 08:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
that you adopted earlier today uh that
 
08:04:03.110 --> 08:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
requires the transfer of liquor funds to
 
08:04:05.448 --> 08:04:05.458 align:start position:0%
the alcohol fund uh to be reduced by the
 
08:04:07.070 --> 08:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
amount of the final donation from the
 
08:04:09.230 --> 08:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals and that was added to make
 
08:04:11.090 --> 08:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
sure that everything that impacts liquor
 
08:04:13.730 --> 08:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
funds and the alcohol fund is identical
 
08:04:16.430 --> 08:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
between what you did earlier and and
 
08:04:18.888 --> 08:04:18.898 align:start position:0%
this amendment so if we were to pass
 
08:04:21.048 --> 08:04:21.058 align:start position:0%
this amendment to keep things neat and
 
08:04:23.330 --> 08:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
clean should we come back and back some
 
08:04:26.270 --> 08:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
of those earlier decisions out
 
08:04:28.250 --> 08:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think you really need to be
 
08:04:29.930 --> 08:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
because it's duplicative of everything
 
08:04:31.548 --> 08:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
that you passed earlier we would only
 
08:04:33.288 --> 08:04:33.298 align:start position:0%
include it in The house's version of
 
08:04:35.208 --> 08:04:35.218 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 once it would read as it
 
08:04:36.770 --> 08:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
does here
 
08:04:40.610 --> 08:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
all right so so in summary
 
08:04:43.368 --> 08:04:43.378 align:start position:0%
this is either identical to the senate
 
08:04:45.948 --> 08:04:45.958 align:start position:0%
or similar to the treatment we've
 
08:04:48.530 --> 08:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
already voted on with the exception of
 
08:04:52.128 --> 08:04:52.138 align:start position:0%
two things it establishes a suspense or
 
08:04:55.128 --> 08:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
a Sunset date of two years and it
 
08:04:57.788 --> 08:04:57.798 align:start position:0%
directs that any future
 
08:05:01.010 --> 08:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
medicated it may be not called expansion
 
08:05:02.990 --> 08:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the future but Medicaid expansion
 
08:05:06.230 --> 08:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond budget instead of off budget as a
 
08:05:07.788 --> 08:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
separate project
 
08:05:10.250 --> 08:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
so the second item I think we just all
 
08:05:11.628 --> 08:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
agree if we're going to be doing this
 
08:05:13.548 --> 08:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
over and over is probably just good
 
08:05:13.558 --> 08:05:14.930 align:start position:0%
over and over is probably just good
policy

08:05:14.930 --> 08:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
policy
 
08:05:16.368 --> 08:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
the part that we probably see
 
08:05:19.788 --> 08:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
differently is the two-year Sunset is
 
08:05:24.770 --> 08:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:26.448 --> 08:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
08:05:28.610 --> 08:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
no I have a clerical question for Mr
 
08:05:32.690 --> 08:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
Ripple page four line 26
 
08:05:35.090 --> 08:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
sections two three four six seven eight
 
08:05:36.948 --> 08:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
have an effective date instead of
 
08:05:39.048 --> 08:05:39.058 align:start position:0%
section five but I don't see section one
 
08:05:43.910 --> 08:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:43.920 --> 08:05:50.510 align:start position:0%
 
issue

08:05:50.510 --> 08:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:53.270 --> 08:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes section one should have an effective
 
08:05:55.670 --> 08:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
date let me see what it is in Senate
 
08:06:05.388 --> 08:06:05.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:05.398 --> 08:06:06.888 align:start position:0%
 
oh

08:06:06.888 --> 08:06:06.898 align:start position:0%
oh
 
08:06:06.898 --> 08:06:08.690 align:start position:0%
oh
um

08:06:08.690 --> 08:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:06:12.230 --> 08:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
it would be upon passage and actually
 
08:06:14.930 --> 08:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's okay because the way House Bill 2
 
08:06:16.610 --> 08:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
was drafted every section that doesn't
 
08:06:18.468 --> 08:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
have a specific effective date is upon
 
08:06:18.478 --> 08:06:20.208 align:start position:0%
have a specific effective date is upon
Passage

08:06:20.208 --> 08:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
08:06:22.910 --> 08:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:27.288 --> 08:06:27.298 align:start position:0%
okay are there questions comments about
 
08:06:28.910 --> 08:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
the proposal
 
08:06:32.270 --> 08:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and do the two halves
 
08:06:34.010 --> 08:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
you can and we'll start with ever
 
08:06:35.930 --> 08:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
whichever half you want to the two
 
08:06:37.430 --> 08:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
things I'd want to talk about since
 
08:06:40.368 --> 08:06:40.378 align:start position:0%
we've already seen and agreed to all of
 
08:06:42.410 --> 08:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
this but those two issues the two-year
 
08:06:45.170 --> 08:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
Sunset and requiring It Go on budget
 
08:06:47.330 --> 08:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
maybe we could limit our conversation to
 
08:06:49.010 --> 08:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
those two things first
 
08:06:55.430 --> 08:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:58.250 --> 08:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the opportunity
 
08:06:58.260 --> 08:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the opportunity
um

08:06:59.510 --> 08:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:07:02.388 --> 08:07:02.398 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh that the decision as to
 
08:07:04.070 --> 08:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's two years are permanent is
 
08:07:06.888 --> 08:07:06.898 align:start position:0%
really a policy decision that uh
 
08:07:11.628 --> 08:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of uh page four line 12
 
08:07:14.090 --> 08:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh including it in our budget is really
 
08:07:15.948 --> 08:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
again I think it was a policy decision
 
08:07:17.810 --> 08:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
originally outside of the department to
 
08:07:19.968 --> 08:07:19.978 align:start position:0%
make that so we're we're agnostic with
 
08:07:20.990 --> 08:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
08:07:23.090 --> 08:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
it's wherever you'd like it to be we'll
 
08:07:24.468 --> 08:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
make it there
 
08:07:27.770 --> 08:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I just had a question on 21 if you
 
08:07:29.448 --> 08:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
could just
 
08:07:32.270 --> 08:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
um on line 21 and Page four just could
 
08:07:33.708 --> 08:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
go over that one more time so I'm
 
08:07:35.510 --> 08:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
following what you did there
 
08:07:38.150 --> 08:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
so this is the same language that was in
 
08:07:40.250 --> 08:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
the earlier alcohol fund amendment that
 
08:07:42.288 --> 08:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
was adopted today right well and that
 
08:07:44.090 --> 08:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
was consistent with what was in the
 
08:07:45.708 --> 08:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
Senate version in terms of how it
 
08:07:47.090 --> 08:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
treated that
 
08:07:49.010 --> 08:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
um the Senate version of Senate Bill 263
 
08:07:51.650 --> 08:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
did everything the same as this with
 
08:07:53.270 --> 08:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
respect to the alcohol fund and the
 
08:07:56.030 --> 08:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
treatment of liquor funds except it did
 
08:07:57.530 --> 08:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
not reduce
 
08:08:00.530 --> 08:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
the transfer from liquor to the alcohol
 
08:08:02.628 --> 08:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
fund by the by the amount of the last
 
08:08:04.368 --> 08:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
remaining Hospital donation so that's
 
08:08:06.170 --> 08:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
what this section is
 
08:08:06.180 --> 08:08:10.310 align:start position:0%
what this section is
okay

08:08:10.310 --> 08:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:12.350 --> 08:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
now if that's helpful perspective I mean
 
08:08:16.128 --> 08:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
I think really the the two things uh you
 
08:08:18.110 --> 08:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
know from a historical standpoint I
 
08:08:20.388 --> 08:08:20.398 align:start position:0%
think the reason I think five years was
 
08:08:22.730 --> 08:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
picked last time was just the
 
08:08:26.750 --> 08:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the uh churn on legislators part in
 
08:08:28.250 --> 08:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
terms of having to do it every two years
 
08:08:30.948 --> 08:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
so but we're in the game for whatever's
 
08:08:35.048 --> 08:08:35.058 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:38.090 --> 08:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
comments questions representative stream
 
08:08:40.788 --> 08:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh this may be picky Yoon but since the
 
08:08:42.888 --> 08:08:42.898 align:start position:0%
meeting first meetings of the Commission
 
08:08:44.868 --> 08:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
in section one start in this biennium
 
08:08:47.628 --> 08:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
and and legislative members get mileage
 
08:08:56.388 --> 08:08:56.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:00.948 --> 08:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
okay the other did other questions
 
08:09:00.958 --> 08:09:04.670 align:start position:0%
okay the other did other questions
comments

08:09:04.670 --> 08:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:08.030 --> 08:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
represent tolersky I'll just make a
 
08:09:10.548 --> 08:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
quick comment that I know for a number
 
08:09:13.430 --> 08:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
of people in my caucus this is a very
 
08:09:16.730 --> 08:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
very high priority and I think they
 
08:09:18.948 --> 08:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
would have expected to have dealt with
 
08:09:21.490 --> 08:09:21.500 align:start position:0%
this when the Senate bill came over
 
08:09:24.590 --> 08:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
after crossover and would have the
 
08:09:26.930 --> 08:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
ability to discuss it have a proper
 
08:09:29.690 --> 08:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
public hearing receive input and and
 
08:09:31.730 --> 08:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
take it as the policy change that it is
 
08:09:35.090 --> 08:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
so that is my big opposition to this is
 
08:09:38.448 --> 08:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't like the uh
 
08:09:41.388 --> 08:09:41.398 align:start position:0%
tacking it on without having the entire
 
08:09:43.190 --> 08:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
house take a look at it individually
 
08:09:45.530 --> 08:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's just too important so you know
 
08:09:48.468 --> 08:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
we're mid-stream though I I think I can
 
08:09:50.750 --> 08:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
agree with you that we want our policy
 
08:09:53.150 --> 08:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
committees involved when that Senate
 
08:09:55.368 --> 08:09:55.378 align:start position:0%
Bill comes over it's going to get worked
 
08:09:57.770 --> 08:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
through the policy committee they will
 
08:09:59.510 --> 08:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
come out with a position the house will
 
08:10:01.670 --> 08:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
come out with a recommendation and
 
08:10:03.350 --> 08:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
depending on the timing of that that
 
08:10:06.350 --> 08:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
will inform anybody that's involved in a
 
08:10:08.810 --> 08:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
committee a conference on what the what
 
08:10:12.468 --> 08:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
the policy-based house position is but
 
08:10:15.670 --> 08:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
but but this basically sets up
 
08:10:18.288 --> 08:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
a point of view on what the house
 
08:10:20.090 --> 08:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
position ought to be I understand what
 
08:10:22.368 --> 08:10:22.378 align:start position:0%
you're saying and my only point is that
 
08:10:25.010 --> 08:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
there are members of my caucus that this
 
08:10:26.868 --> 08:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
is hugely important to them and they
 
08:10:28.910 --> 08:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to be a part of the conversation
 
08:10:30.770 --> 08:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
and I feel establishing this as a house
 
08:10:33.048 --> 08:10:33.058 align:start position:0%
position without letting them have their
 
08:10:36.650 --> 08:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
their time to be a part of the policy
 
08:10:38.930 --> 08:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
making I just I don't think it's it's an
 
08:10:41.270 --> 08:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do it
 
08:10:44.810 --> 08:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
if in the worst case scenario the policy
 
08:10:47.270 --> 08:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee can't get a position out of
 
08:10:49.250 --> 08:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
the house for whatever reason
 
08:10:52.368 --> 08:10:52.378 align:start position:0%
you know that is a possibility at least
 
08:10:53.750 --> 08:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
there would still be a house position
 
08:10:56.208 --> 08:10:56.218 align:start position:0%
that we could talk to the senate about
 
08:10:59.030 --> 08:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and we can change this based on the
 
08:11:01.368 --> 08:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
policy decision if that's sort of a
 
08:11:03.888 --> 08:11:03.898 align:start position:0%
leadership decision so everyone who
 
08:11:05.990 --> 08:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
thinks this is important which is pretty
 
08:11:08.170 --> 08:11:08.180 align:start position:0%
much everyone in the house
 
08:11:11.090 --> 08:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
respects the policy committee and their
 
08:11:11.100 --> 08:11:12.170 align:start position:0%
respects the policy committee and their
input

08:11:12.170 --> 08:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
input
 
08:11:15.650 --> 08:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
I I don't think this is a roadblock to
 
08:11:18.410 --> 08:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
that but I can understand how people
 
08:11:20.868 --> 08:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
might feel that because I just have my
 
08:11:23.270 --> 08:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
own way of looking at it I I think I
 
08:11:25.128 --> 08:11:25.138 align:start position:0%
think two things can happen in parallel
 
08:11:27.770 --> 08:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
but uh representative Waller do you have
 
08:11:29.330 --> 08:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
08:11:31.910 --> 08:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
well I was going to say that I think
 
08:11:33.530 --> 08:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
people are going to be
 
08:11:35.810 --> 08:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
Maybe not maybe not on your side of the
 
08:11:37.490 --> 08:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
aisle but I think on our side of the
 
08:11:38.750 --> 08:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
aisle I do think people are going to be
 
08:11:41.350 --> 08:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
surprised to find it in the budget
 
08:11:44.570 --> 08:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
without having any um
 
08:11:47.750 --> 08:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
any input into it and even
 
08:11:50.930 --> 08:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
it wasn't I mean it wasn't even there
 
08:11:53.208 --> 08:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
for people to comment in the public
 
08:11:55.730 --> 08:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
hearing that we had
 
08:11:55.740 --> 08:11:57.048 align:start position:0%
hearing that we had
so

08:11:57.048 --> 08:11:57.058 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:11:59.270 --> 08:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm concerned about that
 
08:12:02.750 --> 08:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
just that particular process and I guess
 
08:12:04.490 --> 08:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
I could I just asked the department a
 
08:12:07.368 --> 08:12:07.378 align:start position:0%
couple of questions about the um being
 
08:12:09.770 --> 08:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
included in the in the budget
 
08:12:14.150 --> 08:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay I you know I I think from the
 
08:12:15.410 --> 08:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
standpoint of being able to really
 
08:12:18.230 --> 08:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
understand the program every two years
 
08:12:20.690 --> 08:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
when we do the budget I I think it is
 
08:12:24.410 --> 08:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
good to have it in in the budget but how
 
08:12:27.048 --> 08:12:27.058 align:start position:0%
much work is what's going to how how is
 
08:12:28.610 --> 08:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
the department going to handle that I
 
08:12:30.350 --> 08:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
mean when is that going to be when is
 
08:12:31.850 --> 08:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
that work going to be done and how much
 
08:12:33.468 --> 08:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
work is there going to be to doing that
 
08:12:33.478 --> 08:12:35.048 align:start position:0%
work is there going to be to doing that
and

08:12:35.048 --> 08:12:35.058 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:12:37.610 --> 08:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
just explain to me how it's going to
 
08:12:40.788 --> 08:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
work sure so we we already have all of
 
08:12:43.430 --> 08:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers and and the figures um it
 
08:12:44.868 --> 08:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
would really just be
 
08:12:47.030 --> 08:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
adding it to our our agency budget
 
08:12:47.040 --> 08:12:48.350 align:start position:0%
adding it to our our agency budget
requests

08:12:48.350 --> 08:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
requests
 
08:12:50.690 --> 08:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's it's you know but
 
08:12:52.368 --> 08:12:52.378 align:start position:0%
logistically it's it's not that
 
08:12:55.548 --> 08:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
difficult frankly okay so do we stay
 
08:12:55.558 --> 08:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
difficult frankly okay so do we stay
offline

08:12:56.750 --> 08:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
offline
 
08:12:58.910 --> 08:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
during I mean obviously we don't have it
 
08:13:01.670 --> 08:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have any numbers now so we stay
 
08:13:05.388 --> 08:13:05.398 align:start position:0%
offline all of this
 
08:13:08.570 --> 08:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
biennium this upcoming biennium and then
 
08:13:12.708 --> 08:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
we start with the numbers in the next
 
08:13:12.718 --> 08:13:14.270 align:start position:0%
we start with the numbers in the next
biennium

08:13:14.270 --> 08:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
08:13:18.350 --> 08:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
yes yes so it's not going the num the uh
 
08:13:20.990 --> 08:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
cost of this program is not going to be
 
08:13:24.650 --> 08:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
reflected in house bill one or two
 
08:13:27.110 --> 08:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
not unless an additional amendment is
 
08:13:27.120 --> 08:13:28.548 align:start position:0%
not unless an additional amendment is
proposed

08:13:28.548 --> 08:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
08:13:33.230 --> 08:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:36.048 --> 08:13:36.058 align:start position:0%
I think to the other point
 
08:13:39.170 --> 08:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
there's people in the house on the GOP
 
08:13:42.110 --> 08:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
side of the caucus that want to pass
 
08:13:45.410 --> 08:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion and the fact that
 
08:13:48.230 --> 08:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're offering to our members
 
08:13:50.628 --> 08:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
that there is a two-year Sunset where we
 
08:13:52.310 --> 08:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
can keep getting data and keep making
 
08:13:55.190 --> 08:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
sure that this program is on track this
 
08:13:59.030 --> 08:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
helps us get votes too so
 
08:14:01.368 --> 08:14:01.378 align:start position:0%
um so that that that that is a reason
 
08:14:04.010 --> 08:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's in here
 
08:14:05.628 --> 08:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
all right
 
08:14:07.548 --> 08:14:07.558 align:start position:0%
I this there's not a whole lot to
 
08:14:08.830 --> 08:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
discuss on this
 
08:14:11.090 --> 08:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative Holt thank you Mr chair
 
08:14:13.368 --> 08:14:13.378 align:start position:0%
furthermore there was some discussions I
 
08:14:15.888 --> 08:14:15.898 align:start position:0%
mean this is a large dollar item that is
 
08:14:17.930 --> 08:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
off budget and there are people who
 
08:14:19.430 --> 08:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
would like to see the transparency of
 
08:14:22.850 --> 08:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
government and and honestly wanted this
 
08:14:25.368 --> 08:14:25.378 align:start position:0%
in hb1 not an hb2 so there was a
 
08:14:26.990 --> 08:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
compromise on our side at some level as
 
08:14:27.000 --> 08:14:30.530 align:start position:0%
compromise on our side at some level as
well

08:14:30.530 --> 08:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:32.628 --> 08:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments questions
 
08:14:35.330 --> 08:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
of the department
 
08:14:37.670 --> 08:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
I'll even take comments from the
 
08:14:39.530 --> 08:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
audience is there anyone sitting back
 
08:14:43.388 --> 08:14:43.398 align:start position:0%
here it's uh it's past six o'clock so
 
08:15:09.230 --> 08:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:09.240 --> 08:15:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

08:15:12.070 --> 08:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
08:15:15.410 --> 08:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'm Jim Monahan with Dupont group um the
 
08:15:16.910 --> 08:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the same Coalition that has been
 
08:15:18.048 --> 08:15:18.058 align:start position:0%
working around the Medicaid rate
 
08:15:20.270 --> 08:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
increases has also been working with
 
08:15:21.830 --> 08:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
others have been working on the Medicaid
 
08:15:25.250 --> 08:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
reauthorization around 262 and so three
 
08:15:25.260 --> 08:15:27.010 align:start position:0%
reauthorization around 262 and so three
um

08:15:27.010 --> 08:15:27.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:15:30.468 --> 08:15:30.478 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh I was saying that the same
 
08:15:31.968 --> 08:15:31.978 align:start position:0%
Coalition that has been working anyway
 
08:15:34.670 --> 08:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh just uh Paul will talk about it I
 
08:15:35.448 --> 08:15:35.458 align:start position:0%
suspect you know the minute
 
08:15:37.730 --> 08:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative was Edwards observed
 
08:15:39.948 --> 08:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
there were two differences between
 
08:15:43.430 --> 08:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 263 in this amendment I
 
08:15:44.990 --> 08:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
think there's three
 
08:15:48.048 --> 08:15:48.058 align:start position:0%
um the third one is that the
 
08:15:52.610 --> 08:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 263 does not Envision the
 
08:15:55.430 --> 08:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
hospital's voluntary contribution as a
 
08:15:57.230 --> 08:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
part of the um
 
08:15:59.750 --> 08:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's commission mechanism
 
08:16:01.250 --> 08:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
that was there
 
08:16:02.930 --> 08:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and I think could you draw our
 
08:16:04.610 --> 08:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
attention to the line item so that we
 
08:16:06.170 --> 08:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
can see what you're saying yeah why
 
08:16:09.170 --> 08:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
don't I turn that piece over to Paula
 
08:16:10.788 --> 08:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
um thank you Paula minahan Hospital
 
08:16:13.250 --> 08:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
Association so I think it starts on page
 
08:16:17.628 --> 08:16:17.638 align:start position:0%
four its um item 9 9 21 The Liquor
 
08:16:20.570 --> 08:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
Commission fund transfers and I
 
08:16:22.250 --> 08:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
apologize this is the first time we're
 
08:16:24.610 --> 08:16:24.620 align:start position:0%
seeing this as well so maybe I'm just
 
08:16:27.468 --> 08:16:27.478 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting this but
 
08:16:30.468 --> 08:16:30.478 align:start position:0%
um unless Mr Ripple did you say this is
 
08:16:30.478 --> 08:16:31.430 align:start position:0%
um unless Mr Ripple did you say this is
just

08:16:31.430 --> 08:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
08:16:33.888 --> 08:16:33.898 align:start position:0%
what was passed earlier
 
08:16:36.650 --> 08:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
today relative to adjusting
 
08:16:38.750 --> 08:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
the okay
 
08:16:41.810 --> 08:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
um so this is really for
 
08:16:44.810 --> 08:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
what you passed earlier relative to um
 
08:16:47.750 --> 08:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
what happens in the for the remainder of
 
08:16:47.760 --> 08:16:49.310 align:start position:0%
what happens in the for the remainder of
the

08:16:49.310 --> 08:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:16:52.190 --> 08:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
um Governor's commission funding the
 
08:16:55.368 --> 08:16:55.378 align:start position:0%
voluntary contributions but this is
 
08:16:58.670 --> 08:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
unique to this bill
 
08:17:01.368 --> 08:17:01.378 align:start position:0%
um and that is not in 263. that is not
 
08:17:04.190 --> 08:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
in Senate bill 263. is my
 
08:17:07.670 --> 08:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
I believe I I think Jim's right so I'm I
 
08:17:09.350 --> 08:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not seeing it I'm looking at
 
08:17:13.610 --> 08:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:16.910 --> 08:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
oh line see I really am losing it okay
 
08:17:21.468 --> 08:17:21.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:24.410 --> 08:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
this may not be in 263. this is you're
 
08:17:28.070 --> 08:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
saying it's not in SB 263 and I think I
 
08:17:30.888 --> 08:17:30.898 align:start position:0%
think what we should have made clear is
 
08:17:34.610 --> 08:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
that lines 21 through 25 were items that
 
08:17:37.368 --> 08:17:37.378 align:start position:0%
we voted on earlier right
 
08:17:39.948 --> 08:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
um this Division and we're trying to
 
08:17:43.548 --> 08:17:43.558 align:start position:0%
clean up the relationship between what
 
08:17:45.350 --> 08:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
the general funds and other funds ought
 
08:17:48.888 --> 08:17:48.898 align:start position:0%
to be doing to pay these obligations and
 
08:17:52.548 --> 08:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
get sort of the shell game out of here
 
08:17:54.650 --> 08:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals having to make
 
08:17:56.570 --> 08:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
contributions to the alcohol and drug
 
08:17:58.730 --> 08:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
commission and sort of the movement of
 
08:18:01.368 --> 08:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
that money so this is I think the intent
 
08:18:05.208 --> 08:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
is to just do the cleanup to get
 
08:18:06.770 --> 08:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
these different organizations
 
08:18:06.780 --> 08:18:09.110 align:start position:0%
these different organizations
independents

08:18:09.110 --> 08:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
independents
 
08:18:11.628 --> 08:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
Clarity of responsibility into some
 
08:18:11.638 --> 08:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
Clarity of responsibility into some
transparency

08:18:13.190 --> 08:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
08:18:16.430 --> 08:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to point out that it was
 
08:18:18.048 --> 08:18:18.058 align:start position:0%
stated there were two differences
 
08:18:22.910 --> 08:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:25.730 --> 08:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
you agree with that Mr Ripple
 
08:18:27.770 --> 08:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
I agree section 9 is not in Senate Bill
 
08:18:30.650 --> 08:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
263. all right and Miss Ripple pointed
 
08:18:31.850 --> 08:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
that out when he was presenting it as
 
08:18:34.548 --> 08:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
well so I probably made it confusing I'm
 
08:18:36.708 --> 08:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
probably the guy that said too
 
08:18:39.650 --> 08:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
all right and then uh with regard to the
 
08:18:41.030 --> 08:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
the two-year duration of the
 
08:18:42.948 --> 08:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
reauthorization what you'll hear in the
 
08:18:46.190 --> 08:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on on 263 and you know I've been
 
08:18:48.170 --> 08:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
part of this conversation with the uh
 
08:18:50.330 --> 08:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
for some time on it is that
 
08:18:52.128 --> 08:18:52.138 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
08:18:54.708 --> 08:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
or many providers this is really
 
08:18:57.288 --> 08:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
important for the SD sud providers for
 
08:18:59.270 --> 08:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
example uh these are businesses that
 
08:19:01.610 --> 08:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
need some expectation of Revenue going
 
08:19:01.620 --> 08:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
need some expectation of Revenue going
forward

08:19:03.110 --> 08:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
forward
 
08:19:06.468 --> 08:19:06.478 align:start position:0%
um and it and I do a lot of emphasis I
 
08:19:08.930 --> 08:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
think belongs here and the the sub
 
08:19:11.750 --> 08:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
providers who maybe 80 percent of their
 
08:19:14.330 --> 08:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
Medicaid businesses from the granite
 
08:19:16.250 --> 08:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program trying to build a
 
08:19:20.288 --> 08:19:20.298 align:start position:0%
business hire staff have predictability
 
08:19:23.690 --> 08:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
buy buildings for residential units for
 
08:19:25.330 --> 08:19:25.340 align:start position:0%
residential beds and things like that
 
08:19:27.770 --> 08:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
poses a lot of risk and if you don't
 
08:19:30.590 --> 08:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
know on a two-year cycle uh if your
 
08:19:32.388 --> 08:19:32.398 align:start position:0%
funding is going to be there or not it's
 
08:19:34.368 --> 08:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
disruptive to the development of this
 
08:19:36.590 --> 08:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
important industry that's going to be a
 
08:19:39.410 --> 08:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
wad of what you'll hear in 263 so I
 
08:19:41.750 --> 08:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if this two-year Sunset is
 
08:19:44.030 --> 08:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
just to line it up with House Bill one
 
08:19:48.350 --> 08:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
and two being a two-year package or if
 
08:19:50.330 --> 08:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
it extends beyond that into the the
 
08:19:51.770 --> 08:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
policy realm of whether or not we want
 
08:19:53.628 --> 08:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
predict stability in the state as a
 
08:19:56.270 --> 08:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
payer through the program I I don't
 
08:19:58.310 --> 08:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
think it's to line it up with the budget
 
08:20:00.830 --> 08:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
cycle I think this is more to just
 
08:20:03.288 --> 08:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
ensure people who will vote for this
 
08:20:05.208 --> 08:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
extension because a lot of people didn't
 
08:20:06.948 --> 08:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
want this to happen in the first place
 
08:20:08.990 --> 08:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
and aren't interested in extending it
 
08:20:11.990 --> 08:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is a way to say
 
08:20:14.388 --> 08:20:14.398 align:start position:0%
we're going to revisit it so this isn't
 
08:20:15.708 --> 08:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
permanent we're going to continue to
 
08:20:18.288 --> 08:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
revisit it so so I think that's that's
 
08:20:21.110 --> 08:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
what the intent on this is and then
 
08:20:24.048 --> 08:20:24.058 align:start position:0%
if if this were instead of two years
 
08:20:26.270 --> 08:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
four years would that substantially
 
08:20:28.910 --> 08:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
change the mindset of those building
 
08:20:31.128 --> 08:20:31.138 align:start position:0%
their business plans or would it
 
08:20:33.048 --> 08:20:33.058 align:start position:0%
effectively just be the same
 
08:20:35.448 --> 08:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
confusion and ambiguity
 
08:20:38.510 --> 08:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
it would be less bad
 
08:20:40.368 --> 08:20:40.378 align:start position:0%
all right representative hold did you
 
08:20:43.190 --> 08:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:45.110 --> 08:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
I was going to take a slightly alternate
 
08:20:48.468 --> 08:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
view than you right we are put the some
 
08:20:51.048 --> 08:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
of people wanted to see this as an hb1
 
08:20:52.670 --> 08:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
item in the budget which would
 
08:20:54.770 --> 08:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
automatically put the two-year sunset in
 
08:20:57.350 --> 08:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
because it's right so
 
08:20:59.270 --> 08:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of a
 
08:21:02.208 --> 08:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
it's that proverbial swing set that was
 
08:21:04.310 --> 08:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
designed and envisioned by one person
 
08:21:06.230 --> 08:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
and built by somebody else and when all
 
08:21:07.610 --> 08:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
was said and done you had the swing set
 
08:21:09.110 --> 08:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
not hanging on the branches if you've
 
08:21:12.048 --> 08:21:12.058 align:start position:0%
seen that Meme this is the same so what
 
08:21:13.788 --> 08:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
happens in the process which is why the
 
08:21:15.888 --> 08:21:15.898 align:start position:0%
two years is in there right now I think
 
08:21:17.930 --> 08:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
I can understand that when you're
 
08:21:20.030 --> 08:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
building million dollar 100 million
 
08:21:21.770 --> 08:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
dollar plus programs that you need some
 
08:21:24.170 --> 08:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
clarity of where things are going I
 
08:21:26.208 --> 08:21:26.218 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
08:21:27.708 --> 08:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
um I don't see a difference whether it's
 
08:21:31.430 --> 08:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
two years four years or infinite in
 
08:21:34.250 --> 08:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
terms of the next two-year runway for
 
08:21:36.650 --> 08:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
each I I understand the ability to look
 
08:21:38.448 --> 08:21:38.458 align:start position:0%
beyond that but if you were talking to
 
08:21:41.510 --> 08:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
businesses in January of 2020 and they
 
08:21:43.190 --> 08:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
were putting forecasts together no one
 
08:21:44.388 --> 08:21:44.398 align:start position:0%
would have seen the anomaly that
 
08:21:46.610 --> 08:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
happened in February and March so there
 
08:21:48.770 --> 08:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
is some level that we need to take into
 
08:21:50.448 --> 08:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
account we can see a couple years into
 
08:21:52.250 --> 08:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
the future we can plan for a couple
 
08:21:54.650 --> 08:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
years every year we do that and if we're
 
08:21:56.810 --> 08:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
putting it on budget right some of us
 
08:21:59.270 --> 08:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
want it on budget this year we can't do
 
08:22:01.788 --> 08:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
that but we're trying to get there
 
08:22:05.750 --> 08:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
no I I understand I mean if you know the
 
08:22:07.610 --> 08:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers are in
 
08:22:09.888 --> 08:22:09.898 align:start position:0%
the same situation 80 of the funding
 
08:22:11.510 --> 08:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
comes through Medicaid and every two
 
08:22:13.548 --> 08:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
years it might not be there but because
 
08:22:14.750 --> 08:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's been around for a while there's
 
08:22:17.030 --> 08:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
been some certainty it's in state law
 
08:22:18.948 --> 08:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
that they they exist and so I think for
 
08:22:22.070 --> 08:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
again for the sud providers you know
 
08:22:23.930 --> 08:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
when Provisions like this make it harder
 
08:22:25.910 --> 08:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
to go to a bank and say
 
08:22:27.530 --> 08:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
can we borrow three million dollars to
 
08:22:29.810 --> 08:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
build a residential treatment facility
 
08:22:31.610 --> 08:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
um by the way you know there's some
 
08:22:34.368 --> 08:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
doubt there's more doubt you hear what
 
08:22:35.990 --> 08:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm saying represented absolutely but
 
08:22:37.548 --> 08:22:37.558 align:start position:0%
there is also I think the program
 
08:22:41.270 --> 08:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
started in 2014 or thereabouts so
 
08:22:42.888 --> 08:22:42.898 align:start position:0%
there's yeah we're eight years into this
 
08:22:45.288 --> 08:22:45.298 align:start position:0%
at this point right so
 
08:22:46.548 --> 08:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
um getting it on budget for the first
 
08:22:48.590 --> 08:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
time is an important metric in where you
 
08:22:50.208 --> 08:22:50.218 align:start position:0%
want to go
 
08:22:52.788 --> 08:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
um and while we may disagree what the
 
08:22:54.590 --> 08:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
dollar value and all of that but it's
 
08:22:57.350 --> 08:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
baby steps so so well I just hope we
 
08:23:00.230 --> 08:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity in 263 to make the
 
08:23:03.350 --> 08:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
case for for you know more permanency to
 
08:23:04.910 --> 08:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
the reauthorization so I really do
 
08:23:06.770 --> 08:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate the perspective you added
 
08:23:09.888 --> 08:23:09.898 align:start position:0%
because I I hadn't thought through the
 
08:23:11.868 --> 08:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility needing a
 
08:23:14.090 --> 08:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
business loan that's just an example I
 
08:23:15.288 --> 08:23:15.298 align:start position:0%
it just hadn't considered it
 
08:23:18.110 --> 08:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
08:23:20.208 --> 08:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
we forget that this is an evolving
 
08:23:22.548 --> 08:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
program and the first page
 
08:23:24.830 --> 08:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
talks about appointing this very lengthy
 
08:23:24.840 --> 08:23:26.208 align:start position:0%
talks about appointing this very lengthy
Commission

08:23:26.208 --> 08:23:26.218 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
08:23:29.090 --> 08:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the effectiveness and future
 
08:23:30.770 --> 08:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire granted Advantage
 
08:23:34.128 --> 08:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
Health Care Program so that presupposes
 
08:23:36.888 --> 08:23:36.898 align:start position:0%
there will be big changes if this
 
08:23:39.410 --> 08:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
commission decides that that it needs to
 
08:23:41.990 --> 08:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
do this it needs to do that and so on so
 
08:23:43.788 --> 08:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
we we're going to get their report
 
08:23:46.190 --> 08:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
within the year hopefully and it gives
 
08:23:49.128 --> 08:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
us a year to make changes or so on so
 
08:23:51.530 --> 08:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
that going forward we may adopt there
 
08:23:53.990 --> 08:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
may be some great recommendations come
 
08:23:55.548 --> 08:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
from this commission that want to be
 
08:23:58.070 --> 08:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
adopted so that's why you don't want to
 
08:24:03.128 --> 08:24:03.138 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:05.628 --> 08:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
in 2018 when the legislature
 
08:24:05.638 --> 08:24:07.250 align:start position:0%
in 2018 when the legislature
reauthorized

08:24:07.250 --> 08:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
reauthorized
 
08:24:09.708 --> 08:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
um through how Senate Bill 313 it also
 
08:24:11.690 --> 08:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
included a commission commission meant
 
08:24:13.788 --> 08:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
many times they concluded the work this
 
08:24:15.170 --> 08:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
summer and one of their recommendations
 
08:24:15.180 --> 08:24:16.368 align:start position:0%
summer and one of their recommendations
was

08:24:16.368 --> 08:24:16.378 align:start position:0%
was
 
08:24:18.530 --> 08:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
permanent reauthorization
 
08:24:22.010 --> 08:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
and so in full disclosure uh Mr chair my
 
08:24:25.788 --> 08:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
boss uh I I am a member or was a member
 
08:24:29.030 --> 08:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh of this commission that's been
 
08:24:32.270 --> 08:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
established and I was a signatory saying
 
08:24:34.788 --> 08:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's my idea or my recommendation that
 
08:24:38.930 --> 08:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
we make this permanent so
 
08:24:42.708 --> 08:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
so there's that so we I do have a
 
08:24:44.690 --> 08:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
history of sometimes agreeing with
 
08:24:46.548 --> 08:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
08:24:49.548 --> 08:24:49.558 align:start position:0%
so and I just would like to make one
 
08:24:50.990 --> 08:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
comment about
 
08:24:52.788 --> 08:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
um those individuals that are on
 
08:24:52.798 --> 08:24:54.110 align:start position:0%
um those individuals that are on
Medicaid

08:24:54.110 --> 08:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
08:24:54.120 --> 08:24:55.128 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
um

08:24:55.128 --> 08:24:55.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:24:58.430 --> 08:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
um expansion that they they go on and
 
08:25:00.948 --> 08:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
off quite frequently because this really
 
08:25:03.708 --> 08:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for them if they're if
 
08:25:06.830 --> 08:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
they lose their job or are struggling
 
08:25:09.708 --> 08:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
um financially to get on and get
 
08:25:11.930 --> 08:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
assistance and so that they can take
 
08:25:13.670 --> 08:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
care of themselves and their families so
 
08:25:16.070 --> 08:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they can get a job and we have
 
08:25:17.810 --> 08:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
statistics and I know
 
08:25:21.048 --> 08:25:21.058 align:start position:0%
um Mr lippman has this data that again
 
08:25:23.270 --> 08:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
we will be sharing in full transparency
 
08:25:26.690 --> 08:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing on 263 because
 
08:25:29.388 --> 08:25:29.398 align:start position:0%
a lot of work has been done and a lot of
 
08:25:32.570 --> 08:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
data has been collected individuals do
 
08:25:35.868 --> 08:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
not stay on this for very long I do
 
08:25:39.048 --> 08:25:39.058 align:start position:0%
um I I do I worry a lot about doing this
 
08:25:41.448 --> 08:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
every two years there is um that would
 
08:25:44.750 --> 08:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
really impact I believe them as well not
 
08:25:47.388 --> 08:25:47.398 align:start position:0%
knowing whether or not this would exist
 
08:25:48.948 --> 08:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
um in the future
 
08:25:50.750 --> 08:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the commission made that
 
08:25:52.310 --> 08:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation so they wouldn't have to
 
08:25:54.610 --> 08:25:54.620 align:start position:0%
go back and study this again
 
08:25:57.190 --> 08:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
now the commission would continue under
 
08:26:00.410 --> 08:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
263. yeah yeah
 
08:26:03.948 --> 08:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you is there any more
 
08:26:05.330 --> 08:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
 
08:26:07.850 --> 08:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
I I so with that
 
08:26:10.610 --> 08:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
I I don't I'm not seeing or hearing any
 
08:26:10.620 --> 08:26:12.170 align:start position:0%
I I don't I'm not seeing or hearing any
proposed

08:26:12.170 --> 08:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
08:26:15.288 --> 08:26:15.298 align:start position:0%
changes to this but but I think it's
 
08:26:19.490 --> 08:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
implied for all those who are in favor
 
08:26:21.968 --> 08:26:21.978 align:start position:0%
of approving
 
08:26:26.628 --> 08:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:26:29.810 --> 08:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
08:26:34.850 --> 08:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
08:26:37.010 --> 08:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm going to say it again
 
08:26:39.888 --> 08:26:39.898 align:start position:0%
and probably be wrong again but I think
 
08:26:42.888 --> 08:26:42.898 align:start position:0%
we're down to just one item is that
 
08:26:45.770 --> 08:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
correct and I think the one item is
 
08:26:50.510 --> 08:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
coming from OLS dealing with our
 
08:26:53.030 --> 08:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
rate hike recommendation
 
08:26:55.670 --> 08:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct and I do have the
 
08:26:56.990 --> 08:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
Amendments but I'm going through them
 
08:26:59.570 --> 08:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
now and I'd like to run each one by the
 
08:27:01.430 --> 08:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
respective sides before you discuss it
 
08:27:03.410 --> 08:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
so you need 10 minutes for quality
 
08:27:05.150 --> 08:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
assurance to make sure you think it's
 
08:27:08.150 --> 08:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
right I think so yes all right so let's
 
08:45:50.990 --> 08:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:45:53.930 --> 08:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
all right let's uh let's come out of
 
08:45:56.750 --> 08:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
recess while we were away
 
08:45:59.030 --> 08:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Weiler kicked over a
 
08:46:01.548 --> 08:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
rock with Mr lippman and something came
 
08:46:03.350 --> 08:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
out that she wants to tell us about and
 
08:46:05.590 --> 08:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
talk about she says she needs 60 seconds
 
08:46:08.350 --> 08:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
what did I say
 
08:46:11.750 --> 08:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
walner won't no no no no no no I I'm
 
08:46:14.750 --> 08:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's just uh I'm fading I think I I'm
 
08:46:17.090 --> 08:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
not a young man anymore
 
08:46:17.100 --> 08:46:17.868 align:start position:0%
not a young man anymore
um

08:46:17.868 --> 08:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:46:20.208 --> 08:46:20.218 align:start position:0%
so we'll kick over that rock and and you
 
08:46:22.070 --> 08:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
can tell us what this is yeah well let
 
08:46:24.830 --> 08:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
Mr lip Moon explain it to you I just I
 
08:46:26.330 --> 08:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
just think it's information I know we've
 
08:46:28.548 --> 08:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
already voted it's it's going to be in
 
08:46:30.230 --> 08:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
the budget Medicaid expansion is going
 
08:46:31.850 --> 08:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
to be in the budget but I just think we
 
08:46:34.850 --> 08:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
need to be aware of the pitfalls that we
 
08:46:37.250 --> 08:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
might be falling into okay because it'll
 
08:46:39.468 --> 08:46:39.478 align:start position:0%
come out later and then you'll say oh I
 
08:46:41.150 --> 08:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
didn't know that I hate to be
 
08:46:43.070 --> 08:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy but if this is really
 
08:46:45.110 --> 08:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
important we just voted on her we could
 
08:46:48.350 --> 08:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
maybe come back so I mean I I'm not ever
 
08:46:50.388 --> 08:46:50.398 align:start position:0%
committed to doing something stupid just
 
08:46:51.888 --> 08:46:51.898 align:start position:0%
because we did it
 
08:46:54.350 --> 08:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
we I just think it's good good to know
 
08:46:57.430 --> 08:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
before the public tells you right okay
 
08:47:00.350 --> 08:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman
 
08:47:03.888 --> 08:47:03.898 align:start position:0%
so similar to the issue that Jim Monahan
 
08:47:06.350 --> 08:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
raised there's a similar issue in
 
08:47:08.990 --> 08:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
procuring the MCO contract you may or
 
08:47:11.628 --> 08:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
may not know that our contract expires
 
08:47:13.910 --> 08:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
August to 24 so we're going to be doing
 
08:47:16.548 --> 08:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
a re-procurement uh
 
08:47:19.190 --> 08:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
starting September of this year so that
 
08:47:20.690 --> 08:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
we can get something in place for
 
08:47:22.968 --> 08:47:22.978 align:start position:0%
September next year what I see
 
08:47:25.730 --> 08:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
potentially is that they could it might
 
08:47:28.910 --> 08:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
affect who bids based on the uncertainty
 
08:47:31.070 --> 08:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
and whether we get as many bidders with
 
08:47:32.830 --> 08:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
just a two-year
 
08:47:35.570 --> 08:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
reauthorization that's I think an
 
08:47:36.888 --> 08:47:36.898 align:start position:0%
important thing when you talk about
 
08:47:38.930 --> 08:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
where can we maybe get Contract savings
 
08:47:41.030 --> 08:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you only give a one-year
 
08:47:43.430 --> 08:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
commitment we may lose
 
08:47:45.468 --> 08:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
um you know the field that would bid for
 
08:47:46.968 --> 08:47:46.978 align:start position:0%
it otherwise
 
08:47:50.510 --> 08:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
question for you okay if if we change
 
08:47:53.388 --> 08:47:53.398 align:start position:0%
the sunset from two years to four years
 
08:47:55.610 --> 08:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
that would effectively give you three
 
08:47:58.910 --> 08:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
years to to run the contract is three
 
08:48:01.310 --> 08:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
years a nice bite at the contract Apple
 
08:48:04.490 --> 08:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
I I think that's much better than than
 
08:48:07.730 --> 08:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
that situation I think you know in terms
 
08:48:09.948 --> 08:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
of I think is it more reasonable
 
08:48:12.288 --> 08:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
certainty that that they have a chance
 
08:48:16.490 --> 08:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
to you know get it set up and be able to
 
08:48:19.190 --> 08:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know have you know several years if
 
08:48:20.868 --> 08:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
you're for example if we're able to
 
08:48:23.270 --> 08:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
attract a new bidder you know it takes
 
08:48:25.490 --> 08:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
them 18 months to stand up their their
 
08:48:28.490 --> 08:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
program so so so what's what's the
 
08:48:31.670 --> 08:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
standard length of the contract five
 
08:48:33.830 --> 08:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
years you really want to have five to be
 
08:48:33.840 --> 08:48:34.610 align:start position:0%
years you really want to have five to be
normal

08:48:34.610 --> 08:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
normal
 
08:48:37.128 --> 08:48:37.138 align:start position:0%
that that's that's what we've done um
 
08:48:39.110 --> 08:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
the last two procurements so if we were
 
08:48:41.930 --> 08:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
to do that it would have to be six years
 
08:48:45.048 --> 08:48:45.058 align:start position:0%
the way we're lined up now yes
 
08:48:49.548 --> 08:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
all right so that's all interesting data
 
08:48:57.110 --> 08:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:48:59.448 --> 08:48:59.458 align:start position:0%
are you open or proposing a
 
08:49:01.730 --> 08:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
reconsideration with a tweak to the
 
08:49:04.250 --> 08:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
sunset I'm open to reconsider the sunset
 
08:49:07.190 --> 08:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
if if there's discussion and thought on
 
08:49:09.230 --> 08:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
what we just heard
 
08:49:11.990 --> 08:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
I would be more than willing to make a
 
08:49:14.090 --> 08:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider the vote if we can
 
08:49:16.730 --> 08:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
look to extending the sunset from two
 
08:49:19.968 --> 08:49:19.978 align:start position:0%
years to six years which would allow the
 
08:49:22.730 --> 08:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
better procurement of the contracts and
 
08:49:25.430 --> 08:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh put the department in a much stronger
 
08:49:27.708 --> 08:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
position to get
 
08:49:31.490 --> 08:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
08:49:31.500 --> 08:49:34.730 align:start position:0%
 
comment

08:49:34.730 --> 08:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
08:49:37.788 --> 08:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
well I don't know this is new data so I
 
08:49:39.288 --> 08:49:39.298 align:start position:0%
didn't know if the new data would
 
08:49:42.410 --> 08:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
influence your viewpoint
 
08:49:44.510 --> 08:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think that the expanded Medicaid
 
08:49:47.330 --> 08:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
Program has been on
 
08:49:47.340 --> 08:49:48.888 align:start position:0%
Program has been on
effectively

08:49:48.888 --> 08:49:48.898 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
08:49:50.990 --> 08:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
fixed cycle
 
08:49:52.788 --> 08:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
budget requests I think the first time
 
08:49:54.770 --> 08:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
was two years if I recall and then it
 
08:49:56.628 --> 08:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
was was it two years again and then five
 
08:49:58.850 --> 08:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
years I'm trying to rank it was two two
 
08:50:00.948 --> 08:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
and five two two and five so I I think
 
08:50:02.628 --> 08:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
the providers can handle a two-year
 
08:50:04.070 --> 08:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
window in terms of quoting it's been
 
08:50:06.410 --> 08:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
done twice before there's a track record
 
08:50:08.810 --> 08:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
now on nine years so there is some
 
08:50:10.190 --> 08:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
expectation that it's going to go
 
08:50:10.200 --> 08:50:11.208 align:start position:0%
expectation that it's going to go
forward

08:50:11.208 --> 08:50:11.218 align:start position:0%
forward
 
08:50:13.250 --> 08:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I in the business cycle it's possible
 
08:50:16.368 --> 08:50:16.378 align:start position:0%
to do a two-year contract
 
08:50:18.770 --> 08:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
they can't do your contract because this
 
08:50:21.410 --> 08:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
one expires at a point in time in which
 
08:50:24.048 --> 08:50:24.058 align:start position:0%
if we put two years in they can only do
 
08:50:26.570 --> 08:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
one year correct and if we do four years
 
08:50:29.208 --> 08:50:29.218 align:start position:0%
it can only do three years if we do six
 
08:50:31.910 --> 08:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
years it can do five years that's this
 
08:50:33.830 --> 08:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
is what I'm hearing
 
08:50:37.730 --> 08:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman if I understand correctly I
 
08:50:39.590 --> 08:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
think the current contract is a December
 
08:50:43.430 --> 08:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
31st expiration date yes no um it is in
 
08:50:50.830 --> 08:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:50:54.110 --> 08:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler do you have any
 
08:50:57.048 --> 08:50:57.058 align:start position:0%
thoughts given the confrontation with
 
08:50:58.868 --> 08:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
this new data
 
08:51:01.070 --> 08:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
I thought we didn't want to make this
 
08:51:02.750 --> 08:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
permanent but basically we're getting
 
08:51:05.090 --> 08:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
around to it
 
08:51:08.330 --> 08:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
so what I think I just heard you say is
 
08:51:10.250 --> 08:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
that you would want to maintain the two
 
08:51:13.010 --> 08:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
years and you wouldn't be open to
 
08:51:15.770 --> 08:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
considering four years for example
 
08:51:18.170 --> 08:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'm open if if that's what people want
 
08:51:20.990 --> 08:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
but you know obviously in the past we
 
08:51:21.888 --> 08:51:21.898 align:start position:0%
have had
 
08:51:23.990 --> 08:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
two-year contract but as he said that's
 
08:51:25.910 --> 08:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
really only is one year because it takes
 
08:51:27.410 --> 08:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
them so long to ramp up but what about
 
08:51:29.150 --> 08:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
the ones that are currently doing this
 
08:51:31.128 --> 08:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
isn't it easy for them to continue
 
08:51:33.170 --> 08:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
without ramp up
 
08:51:36.110 --> 08:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't okay to get another two-year
 
08:51:38.808 --> 08:51:38.818 align:start position:0%
contract wouldn't we at least need to do
 
08:51:41.150 --> 08:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
a sunset of three years
 
08:51:41.160 --> 08:51:45.530 align:start position:0%
a sunset of three years
yes

08:51:45.530 --> 08:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:48.288 --> 08:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
so for those people who really love two
 
08:51:52.070 --> 08:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
years is three years kind of acceptable
 
08:51:54.650 --> 08:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
just to just to give them I would just
 
08:51:56.510 --> 08:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
leave it where it is you would leave it
 
08:51:56.520 --> 08:52:00.888 align:start position:0%
leave it where it is you would leave it
yes

08:52:00.888 --> 08:52:00.898 align:start position:0%
 
08:52:03.468 --> 08:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
we're not creating a law today we're in
 
08:52:05.170 --> 08:52:05.180 align:start position:0%
the process of creating a two-year
 
08:52:07.850 --> 08:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar budget there's a
 
08:52:09.708 --> 08:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunities to have this
 
08:52:11.388 --> 08:52:11.398 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we should stay at two
 
08:52:11.398 --> 08:52:15.708 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we should stay at two
years

08:52:15.708 --> 08:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:52:18.948 --> 08:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
well I I hate doing things that I don't
 
08:52:23.030 --> 08:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
think make sense and I I I think based
 
08:52:25.730 --> 08:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
on the I had never considered or
 
08:52:29.510 --> 08:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
factored in the contract windows
 
08:52:31.788 --> 08:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
we have experience doing two-year
 
08:52:33.770 --> 08:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
contracts we don't have experience doing
 
08:52:38.208 --> 08:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
08:52:40.128 --> 08:52:40.138 align:start position:0%
MCO procurements have been five years
 
08:52:44.030 --> 08:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
each each time yeah so
 
08:52:46.850 --> 08:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
so a lot of Manpower gets burnt going
 
08:52:49.010 --> 08:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
through the whole contract
 
08:52:51.770 --> 08:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an expensive process
 
08:52:53.990 --> 08:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
where we don't see the dollars but the
 
08:52:56.410 --> 08:52:56.420 align:start position:0%
the Manpower gets consumed
 
08:52:59.930 --> 08:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
and I do think that there there is some
 
08:53:01.850 --> 08:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
impact in terms of
 
08:53:03.830 --> 08:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
how they have to factor in their startup
 
08:53:06.128 --> 08:53:06.138 align:start position:0%
cost recovery when when they make a bid
 
08:53:09.190 --> 08:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
08:53:11.270 --> 08:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
having the opportunity for other
 
08:53:13.670 --> 08:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
entrants to to at least be interested in
 
08:53:13.680 --> 08:53:14.510 align:start position:0%
entrants to to at least be interested in
it

08:53:14.510 --> 08:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:53:17.030 --> 08:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
helps you know over a five-year period
 
08:53:19.730 --> 08:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's over six billion of spending and so
 
08:53:23.150 --> 08:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
I think that that that
 
08:53:23.160 --> 08:53:24.170 align:start position:0%
I think that that that
um

08:53:24.170 --> 08:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:53:28.610 --> 08:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
having some more competition helps the
 
08:53:30.410 --> 08:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
state get a better deal on what it's
 
08:53:34.010 --> 08:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
going to be getting if if we were the
 
08:53:36.110 --> 08:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
last stop in this process and not the
 
08:53:36.120 --> 08:53:37.308 align:start position:0%
last stop in this process and not the
first

08:53:37.308 --> 08:53:37.318 align:start position:0%
first
 
08:53:37.318 --> 08:53:38.330 align:start position:0%
first
um

08:53:38.330 --> 08:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:53:42.230 --> 08:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
I I would I would eat up everything you
 
08:53:44.510 --> 08:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
just said and and and and and try to
 
08:53:46.610 --> 08:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
deliver but this is the first step in a
 
08:53:49.308 --> 08:53:49.318 align:start position:0%
process so so I I don't think I'm open
 
08:53:51.888 --> 08:53:51.898 align:start position:0%
to reopening the vote we voted on two
 
08:53:54.948 --> 08:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
years and
 
08:53:54.958 --> 08:53:57.350 align:start position:0%
years and
um

08:53:57.350 --> 08:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:53:57.360 --> 08:54:00.170 align:start position:0%
 
what

08:54:00.170 --> 08:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
what
 
08:54:03.410 --> 08:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
go go go ahead
 
08:54:05.628 --> 08:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman it just seems
 
08:54:06.888 --> 08:54:06.898 align:start position:0%
from the discussion and I knew this
 
08:54:08.990 --> 08:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
would be a sticking point
 
08:54:12.468 --> 08:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
it seems like four years would be an
 
08:54:15.888 --> 08:54:15.898 align:start position:0%
appropriate starting point and so I'm
 
08:54:18.490 --> 08:54:18.500 align:start position:0%
wondering if the committee would
 
08:54:21.590 --> 08:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
consider a four-year
 
08:54:24.770 --> 08:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
time frame on this particular Amendment
 
08:54:26.570 --> 08:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
and while I have the mic I just want to
 
08:54:28.128 --> 08:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
point out too you brought up a very good
 
08:54:29.990 --> 08:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
point that it is important to have this
 
08:54:32.150 --> 08:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the budget to keep it alive in case
 
08:54:35.208 --> 08:54:35.218 align:start position:0%
anything goes wrong with the Senate Bill
 
08:54:35.218 --> 08:54:37.030 align:start position:0%
anything goes wrong with the Senate Bill
version

08:54:37.030 --> 08:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
version
 
08:54:42.590 --> 08:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
263. so I would put out there four years
 
08:54:45.110 --> 08:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
based on this new information based on
 
08:54:48.590 --> 08:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
previous based on where both sides are
 
08:54:51.350 --> 08:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
differentiating on this
 
08:54:54.110 --> 08:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
four years is my thought
 
08:54:56.690 --> 08:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
I hate to do this but I I think we need
 
08:59:02.048 --> 08:59:02.058 align:start position:0%
 
08:59:06.410 --> 08:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
all right we're we're out of recess and
 
08:59:11.150 --> 08:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
um we uh have already voted on
 
08:59:15.708 --> 08:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
um the amendment I think it was 11 28.
 
08:59:18.350 --> 08:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
or whatever the number was it was the
 
08:59:21.770 --> 08:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
one with the two-year sunset this is an
 
08:59:26.750 --> 08:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
early step in a one path to the
 
08:59:30.110 --> 08:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
completion of this and so I let's just
 
08:59:31.968 --> 08:59:31.978 align:start position:0%
be done with it we've already voted
 
08:59:34.670 --> 08:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
let's let's move on
 
08:59:37.670 --> 08:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:59:40.368 --> 08:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham is going to
 
08:59:44.808 --> 08:59:44.818 align:start position:0%
take the First at-bat on explaining your
 
08:59:48.770 --> 08:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate hike proposal and then
 
08:59:52.730 --> 08:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative hole and Earth will take
 
08:59:59.930 --> 08:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
09:00:01.368 --> 09:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
well great
 
09:00:03.830 --> 09:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
um an amendment is going to be handed
 
09:00:05.150 --> 09:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
out I don't know what the amendment
 
09:00:06.770 --> 09:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
number is
 
09:00:10.490 --> 09:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
um but uh you know the process of uh we
 
09:00:12.288 --> 09:00:12.298 align:start position:0%
were we were
 
09:00:14.030 --> 09:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
originally brought
 
09:00:15.888 --> 09:00:15.898 align:start position:0%
uh hb2
 
09:00:15.898 --> 09:00:18.530 align:start position:0%
uh hb2
with

09:00:18.530 --> 09:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
with
 
09:00:22.070 --> 09:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
with uh across the board rate increases
 
09:00:26.090 --> 09:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid services at 3.1 percent
 
09:00:28.670 --> 09:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh since that's been done we've been
 
09:00:32.150 --> 09:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
working on the process of of uh
 
09:00:34.610 --> 09:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
determining really how much increase we
 
09:00:37.430 --> 09:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
needed and also uh where we could Target
 
09:00:39.468 --> 09:00:39.478 align:start position:0%
it to be the most effective
 
09:00:42.948 --> 09:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
and during that process we we got a
 
09:00:46.670 --> 09:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of input from from
 
09:00:48.730 --> 09:00:48.740 align:start position:0%
many different providers
 
09:00:51.468 --> 09:00:51.478 align:start position:0%
receiving Medicaid funds and through the
 
09:00:51.478 --> 09:00:52.330 align:start position:0%
receiving Medicaid funds and through the
services

09:00:52.330 --> 09:00:52.340 align:start position:0%
services
 
09:00:55.670 --> 09:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
on both of these questions the level of
 
09:00:58.448 --> 09:00:58.458 align:start position:0%
funding that would be
 
09:01:02.030 --> 09:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to close some of the gaps and
 
09:01:04.808 --> 09:01:04.818 align:start position:0%
services because often
 
09:01:08.690 --> 09:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
are artificially low rates were so low
 
09:01:10.730 --> 09:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
that essentially they couldn't find
 
09:01:14.770 --> 09:01:14.780 align:start position:0%
providers to do things so
 
09:01:17.150 --> 09:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
increasing the budget without increasing
 
09:01:19.968 --> 09:01:19.978 align:start position:0%
the targeted or the rates for some of
 
09:01:22.730 --> 09:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
these Services uh was was a high
 
09:01:25.190 --> 09:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
priority for us as a committee
 
09:01:27.170 --> 09:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
09:01:27.180 --> 09:01:28.548 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

09:01:28.548 --> 09:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:01:32.208 --> 09:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
uh with that we the request came in for
 
09:01:35.570 --> 09:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
our for as low as zero percent uh from
 
09:01:37.308 --> 09:01:37.318 align:start position:0%
the hospital inpatient and outpatient
 
09:01:40.308 --> 09:01:40.318 align:start position:0%
industry uh for a hospital inpatient
 
09:01:43.308 --> 09:01:43.318 align:start position:0%
outpatient services uh to Upward and
 
09:01:48.530 --> 09:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
over 25 percent uh so uh I offer
 
09:01:54.830 --> 09:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
um uh Amendment uh 1154 H which
 
09:01:54.840 --> 09:01:55.448 align:start position:0%
um uh Amendment uh 1154 H which
um

09:01:55.448 --> 09:01:55.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:01:58.610 --> 09:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh you know was was the result of the
 
09:02:02.030 --> 09:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
concerted effort uh by stakeholders as
 
09:02:03.708 --> 09:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
well as the members of the committee
 
09:02:07.250 --> 09:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
themselves from both parties uh uh
 
09:02:10.270 --> 09:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
requesting approximately
 
09:02:14.288 --> 09:02:14.298 align:start position:0%
175 million dollars in Appropriations
 
09:02:17.808 --> 09:02:17.818 align:start position:0%
roughly 75 million in the first year and
 
09:02:20.150 --> 09:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
100 million in the second year
 
09:02:24.288 --> 09:02:24.298 align:start position:0%
uh the the numbers uh written in this
 
09:02:29.270 --> 09:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
amendment include the figures that were
 
09:02:32.330 --> 09:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
originally provided or the 17 million
 
09:02:36.650 --> 09:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
per year that was in the governor's hb2
 
09:02:38.990 --> 09:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
budget so we did that even though
 
09:02:40.730 --> 09:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
there's still a separate line item in
 
09:02:43.670 --> 09:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
there there's wording in there to say
 
09:02:47.570 --> 09:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
that taking into account the other uh
 
09:02:50.510 --> 09:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
monies that would be appropriated under
 
09:02:55.308 --> 09:02:55.318 align:start position:0%
existing what was lined 232 in hb2 this
 
09:02:57.110 --> 09:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
is the total amount of money that we
 
09:03:00.288 --> 09:03:00.298 align:start position:0%
would need I got I have two clarifying
 
09:03:02.570 --> 09:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
questions one for you and then one for
 
09:03:05.530 --> 09:03:05.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple so
 
09:03:09.190 --> 09:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
am I right to then think that of your
 
09:03:14.410 --> 09:03:14.420 align:start position:0%
175 million the 24 million that's
 
09:03:18.170 --> 09:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
reflected in par in paragraph one under
 
09:03:21.230 --> 09:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
the appropriation that's part of it so
 
09:03:24.650 --> 09:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
your your increment Above This across
 
09:03:30.410 --> 09:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
the board 3.1 percent is 151 million
 
09:03:33.410 --> 09:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
exactly all right so the the second
 
09:03:37.070 --> 09:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying question Mr Ripple you you've
 
09:03:40.250 --> 09:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
you've seen these and if on a side by
 
09:03:43.490 --> 09:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
side is are the the structures of these
 
09:03:46.968 --> 09:03:46.978 align:start position:0%
two amendments identical except for the
 
09:03:50.288 --> 09:03:50.298 align:start position:0%
 
09:03:55.610 --> 09:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
09:03:58.910 --> 09:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment 1154 h
 
09:04:01.730 --> 09:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
outline specific ambulance codes on page
 
09:04:05.150 --> 09:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
three line 16 through 20. thank you
 
09:04:05.160 --> 09:04:07.490 align:start position:0%
three line 16 through 20. thank you
and

09:04:07.490 --> 09:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
09:04:09.590 --> 09:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
also on page three
 
09:04:13.308 --> 09:04:13.318 align:start position:0%
lines 27 through 32 are in this
 
09:04:17.150 --> 09:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
amendment but not in the other Amendment
 
09:04:20.868 --> 09:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
okay did you say page 2 27 through H3
 
09:04:25.430 --> 09:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
09:04:28.308 --> 09:04:28.318 align:start position:0%
okay now that I know what I'm looking at
 
09:04:31.368 --> 09:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
this this is this is only in this
 
09:04:33.350 --> 09:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
version and not in the other that's
 
09:04:35.930 --> 09:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
09:04:40.850 --> 09:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple so lines 21 through 26 on page
 
09:04:42.948 --> 09:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
three are also not in the other
 
09:04:55.308 --> 09:04:55.318 align:start position:0%
 
09:04:55.318 --> 09:05:07.850 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

09:05:07.850 --> 09:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
09:05:10.368 --> 09:05:10.378 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where they they are in
 
09:05:10.378 --> 09:05:11.270 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where they they are in
their

09:05:11.270 --> 09:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
09:05:29.868 --> 09:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
09:05:32.090 --> 09:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
they they are in there but in the other
 
09:05:33.650 --> 09:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
amendments which which I can hand out
 
09:05:35.208 --> 09:05:35.218 align:start position:0%
momentarily they relate to different
 
09:05:37.250 --> 09:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
line numbers because the the line
 
09:05:38.448 --> 09:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
numbers are different between the two
 
09:05:38.458 --> 09:05:40.548 align:start position:0%
numbers are different between the two
amendments

09:05:40.548 --> 09:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
09:05:46.128 --> 09:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
09:05:49.788 --> 09:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
okay as far as structure goes
 
09:05:49.798 --> 09:05:51.490 align:start position:0%
okay as far as structure goes
um

09:05:51.490 --> 09:05:51.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:05:54.048 --> 09:05:54.058 align:start position:0%
representative a whole and
 
09:05:55.670 --> 09:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
09:05:58.910 --> 09:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
it feels to me like the ambulance code
 
09:06:01.910 --> 09:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
Edition on this version
 
09:06:06.490 --> 09:06:06.500 align:start position:0%
may be helpful if we were to pass the uh
 
09:06:09.170 --> 09:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
that version you we don't need the
 
09:06:12.310 --> 09:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
ambulance codes in there so I was
 
09:06:14.990 --> 09:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
speaking with Mr Lipton about this and
 
09:06:16.428 --> 09:06:16.438 align:start position:0%
you might just want to ask him directly
 
09:06:19.548 --> 09:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
but he said this makes their life a lot
 
09:06:19.558 --> 09:06:21.290 align:start position:0%
but he said this makes their life a lot
harder

09:06:21.290 --> 09:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
harder
 
09:06:25.368 --> 09:06:25.378 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead comment on that that uh Mr
 
09:06:29.530 --> 09:06:29.540 align:start position:0%
uh Lipson pointed out to me that uh
 
09:06:31.908 --> 09:06:31.918 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll we'll get them all right one
 
09:06:34.970 --> 09:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
way uh the um representative Waller
 
09:06:34.980 --> 09:06:36.310 align:start position:0%
way uh the um representative Waller
Weiler

09:06:36.310 --> 09:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
09:06:38.150 --> 09:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
the the
 
09:06:41.030 --> 09:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
um uh ambulance codes uh in in most
 
09:06:43.548 --> 09:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and and in Medicare they
 
09:06:45.772 --> 09:06:45.782 align:start position:0%
have urban and rural rates uh but
 
09:06:48.830 --> 09:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in New Hampshire does not so uh
 
09:06:51.170 --> 09:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
my Amendment uh this latest Amendment
 
09:06:53.928 --> 09:06:53.938 align:start position:0%
actually went down to just having one
 
09:06:57.772 --> 09:06:57.782 align:start position:0%
rate for ambulance uh Statewide rather
 
09:06:59.630 --> 09:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
than rural and urban which was the
 
09:07:03.350 --> 09:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
complaint uh that we got about the um uh
 
09:07:05.630 --> 09:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
or the concern that uh was brought
 
09:07:07.908 --> 09:07:07.918 align:start position:0%
forward about having an urban and rural
 
09:07:10.368 --> 09:07:10.378 align:start position:0%
so he would have had changed the
 
09:07:13.368 --> 09:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
structure I I don't know these codes uh
 
09:07:19.150 --> 09:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
so so is the one unified State rate the
 
09:07:22.130 --> 09:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
a0425 and then the others those are
 
09:07:23.690 --> 09:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
those are different ambulance services
 
09:07:26.510 --> 09:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
the 13 that represents a mileage rate
 
09:07:30.408 --> 09:07:30.418 align:start position:0%
for an ambulance service and then uh on
 
09:07:32.272 --> 09:07:32.282 align:start position:0%
top of the you take the mileage times
 
09:07:34.490 --> 09:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
the number of miles and then you add
 
09:07:37.728 --> 09:07:37.738 align:start position:0%
whichever service is appropriate uh and
 
09:07:40.368 --> 09:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
depends on how much medication and how
 
09:07:42.888 --> 09:07:42.898 align:start position:0%
complex the ride is for the ambulance
 
09:07:44.990 --> 09:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
provider one of the three codes actually
 
09:07:46.908 --> 09:07:46.918 align:start position:0%
is of the three remaining codes is
 
09:07:49.310 --> 09:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
actually not even covered under Medicaid
 
09:07:51.048 --> 09:07:51.058 align:start position:0%
provision but there's no reason that it
 
09:07:53.330 --> 09:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
it might not be in the in the future and
 
09:07:55.248 --> 09:07:55.258 align:start position:0%
most ambulance fee schedules have
 
09:07:57.530 --> 09:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
something in for that value okay so
 
09:08:04.548 --> 09:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
after talking to Mr ribbum or Lipson uh
 
09:08:08.568 --> 09:08:08.578 align:start position:0%
yeah it's your position that lines 16
 
09:08:11.272 --> 09:08:11.282 align:start position:0%
through 20 should remain that they those
 
09:08:13.850 --> 09:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
add value right is that right Mr
 
09:08:15.950 --> 09:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham and now we're
 
09:08:19.612 --> 09:08:19.622 align:start position:0%
going to hear Mr lipman's perspective
 
09:08:19.622 --> 09:08:24.772 align:start position:0%
going to hear Mr lipman's perspective

[Music]
 
09:08:29.272 --> 09:08:29.282 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
09:08:31.068 --> 09:08:31.078 align:start position:0%
um Earth and representative Stringham
 
09:08:35.030 --> 09:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
have two different points here one is
 
09:08:37.088 --> 09:08:37.098 align:start position:0%
um in terms of targeting the codes
 
09:08:40.368 --> 09:08:40.378 align:start position:0%
specifically I think and and keeping it
 
09:08:42.772 --> 09:08:42.782 align:start position:0%
simple to to having one code for the
 
09:08:45.470 --> 09:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
state that I agree with that approach I
 
09:08:47.150 --> 09:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
think what representative erf I had
 
09:08:50.388 --> 09:08:50.398 align:start position:0%
mentioned to him is that when you put
 
09:08:52.612 --> 09:08:52.622 align:start position:0%
something into statute if you know
 
09:08:54.650 --> 09:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
federal government or other coding
 
09:08:54.660 --> 09:08:56.272 align:start position:0%
federal government or other coding
changes

09:08:56.272 --> 09:08:56.282 align:start position:0%
changes
 
09:08:59.088 --> 09:08:59.098 align:start position:0%
um then you you run the risk that that
 
09:09:01.670 --> 09:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
this becomes sort of outdated if you
 
09:09:03.470 --> 09:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
will I think that
 
09:09:06.708 --> 09:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
um you know it's workable either way I
 
09:09:08.030 --> 09:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
think having
 
09:09:09.950 --> 09:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
the role in urban would have create
 
09:09:11.510 --> 09:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
would have delayed us implementing
 
09:09:12.588 --> 09:09:12.598 align:start position:0%
something because we would have to
 
09:09:14.208 --> 09:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
create a new methodology
 
09:09:16.670 --> 09:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I hope I didn't make it more
 
09:09:18.650 --> 09:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
confusing but so I'm going to summarize
 
09:09:20.928 --> 09:09:20.938 align:start position:0%
what I just think I heard you say is
 
09:09:24.950 --> 09:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the idea that these code rates be
 
09:09:28.068 --> 09:09:28.078 align:start position:0%
included is fine your concern is that
 
09:09:31.248 --> 09:09:31.258 align:start position:0%
we're using specific codes and those
 
09:09:33.530 --> 09:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
specific codes can change over time and
 
09:09:35.272 --> 09:09:35.282 align:start position:0%
it's that sort of thing that could cause
 
09:09:37.728 --> 09:09:37.738 align:start position:0%
a problem in the long term in the short
 
09:09:39.950 --> 09:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
term no in the long term yes I think
 
09:09:42.950 --> 09:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
that having just one one of these each
 
09:09:46.010 --> 09:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
of these codes here is the better of the
 
09:09:48.170 --> 09:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
two options that if you're going to
 
09:09:50.272 --> 09:09:50.282 align:start position:0%
include this some so just from a utility
 
09:09:53.388 --> 09:09:53.398 align:start position:0%
perspective the uses of these codes is
 
09:09:55.248 --> 09:09:55.258 align:start position:0%
sort of a one and done anyways you're
 
09:09:57.888 --> 09:09:57.898 align:start position:0%
going to go in and and program these in
 
09:10:01.490 --> 09:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
and let them go and then two years from
 
09:10:03.170 --> 09:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
now we're going to be talking about this
 
09:10:05.030 --> 09:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
completely new the codes could be
 
09:10:07.248 --> 09:10:07.258 align:start position:0%
different and these codes now won't
 
09:10:09.548 --> 09:10:09.558 align:start position:0%
matter what we put in here
 
09:10:12.888 --> 09:10:12.898 align:start position:0%
yes in in one respect but I think that
 
09:10:15.112 --> 09:10:15.122 align:start position:0%
if there's if for example a future
 
09:10:17.088 --> 09:10:17.098 align:start position:0%
legislature says do a two percent across
 
09:10:19.368 --> 09:10:19.378 align:start position:0%
the board and the codes don't exist
 
09:10:24.350 --> 09:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
anymore that's where it so so Mr Ripple
 
09:10:24.360 --> 09:10:25.428 align:start position:0%
anymore that's where it so so Mr Ripple
is

09:10:25.428 --> 09:10:25.438 align:start position:0%
is
 
09:10:27.650 --> 09:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
is this
 
09:10:29.928 --> 09:10:29.938 align:start position:0%
is this amendment
 
09:10:33.588 --> 09:10:33.598 align:start position:0%
only valid for the two years or is this
 
09:10:40.368 --> 09:10:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
09:10:42.290 --> 09:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
I believe yeah everything in here
 
09:10:45.530 --> 09:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
relates only to the biennium to your
 
09:10:47.928 --> 09:10:47.938 align:start position:0%
budget so correct next time we look at
 
09:10:49.330 --> 09:10:49.340 align:start position:0%
this in two years
 
09:10:52.490 --> 09:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
we don't care what these codes are that
 
09:10:54.408 --> 09:10:54.418 align:start position:0%
we say today because we're going to be
 
09:10:56.748 --> 09:10:56.758 align:start position:0%
looking at something different
 
09:10:59.450 --> 09:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
is the way I'm interpreting this and so
 
09:11:02.030 --> 09:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
it so it's feeling fine to me to leave
 
09:11:03.650 --> 09:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
these codes in because they provide
 
09:11:06.470 --> 09:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
information they're one-time use they
 
09:11:08.150 --> 09:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't interfere with what we would do in
 
09:11:10.510 --> 09:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle that all sounds
 
09:11:12.950 --> 09:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable and good to me
 
09:11:14.388 --> 09:11:14.398 align:start position:0%
representative irf do you have a
 
09:11:17.030 --> 09:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
different point of view
 
09:11:19.248 --> 09:11:19.258 align:start position:0%
well I think we just want to slip and
 
09:11:20.990 --> 09:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
say if next time around they say oh just
 
09:11:22.310 --> 09:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
increase everything two percent that's
 
09:11:23.990 --> 09:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
where there could be an issue if the
 
09:11:26.810 --> 09:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
codes themselves have gone away
 
09:11:29.088 --> 09:11:29.098 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not you know I'm not going to
 
09:11:32.030 --> 09:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
suggest we change this right what I'm
 
09:11:33.588 --> 09:11:33.598 align:start position:0%
trying to do is if this is good
 
09:11:36.588 --> 09:11:36.598 align:start position:0%
structure I I might suggest that we pick
 
09:11:38.272 --> 09:11:38.282 align:start position:0%
it up and put it in the other one as
 
09:11:39.650 --> 09:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
well I'm just trying to keep the
 
09:11:41.450 --> 09:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
structures aligned
 
09:11:45.830 --> 09:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so thank you anything
 
09:11:47.928 --> 09:11:47.938 align:start position:0%
else while you're sitting there
 
09:11:47.938 --> 09:11:50.450 align:start position:0%
else while you're sitting there
okay

09:11:50.450 --> 09:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
09:11:50.460 --> 09:11:52.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

09:11:52.850 --> 09:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
09:11:55.248 --> 09:11:55.258 align:start position:0%
so what are we doing with lines 21 and
 
09:11:57.950 --> 09:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
26 why are tell me again why these are
 
09:12:01.548 --> 09:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
uh in in this version and isn't compat
 
09:12:04.068 --> 09:12:04.078 align:start position:0%
not the same as what was in the other
 
09:12:04.078 --> 09:12:05.330 align:start position:0%
not the same as what was in the other
version

09:12:05.330 --> 09:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
version
 
09:12:09.408 --> 09:12:09.418 align:start position:0%
lines 21 through 23 is in your version
 
09:12:11.810 --> 09:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
It's just in a different place that
 
09:12:14.928 --> 09:12:14.938 align:start position:0%
relates to the Granite State
 
09:12:18.530 --> 09:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
um request is that right it is yes and
 
09:12:21.830 --> 09:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
and if I could the reasons 21 through 26
 
09:12:23.630 --> 09:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
are bracketed is because I got the
 
09:12:25.612 --> 09:12:25.622 align:start position:0%
amounts wrong it should have been 1.5
 
09:12:28.612 --> 09:12:28.622 align:start position:0%
million and 3 million online 21 and the
 
09:12:30.408 --> 09:12:30.418 align:start position:0%
amount on 24 should have been the the
 
09:12:32.208 --> 09:12:32.218 align:start position:0%
handwritten number that you see here so
 
09:12:33.290 --> 09:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's that's why you have The
 
09:12:33.300 --> 09:12:35.388 align:start position:0%
that's that's why you have The
annotation

09:12:35.388 --> 09:12:35.398 align:start position:0%
annotation
 
09:12:37.850 --> 09:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just trying to keep the
 
09:12:40.970 --> 09:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
structure as you so this is a different
 
09:12:43.068 --> 09:12:43.078 align:start position:0%
structure than the other Amendment and
 
09:12:44.690 --> 09:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand why we
 
09:12:46.368 --> 09:12:46.378 align:start position:0%
need this and we didn't need it in the
 
09:12:49.190 --> 09:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
other version those Roman 20 and 21 are
 
09:12:51.530 --> 09:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
in the other version
 
09:12:51.540 --> 09:12:52.970 align:start position:0%
in the other version
so

09:12:52.970 --> 09:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:12:54.950 --> 09:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
so with the exception of the ambulance
 
09:12:57.350 --> 09:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
codes this structure is identical it's
 
09:12:58.728 --> 09:12:58.738 align:start position:0%
just the dollar amounts that are
 
09:13:01.272 --> 09:13:01.282 align:start position:0%
different the ambulance codes
 
09:13:04.728 --> 09:13:04.738 align:start position:0%
the provision online is 27 through 28
 
09:13:06.170 --> 09:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
that says each of the individual
 
09:13:08.088 --> 09:13:08.098 align:start position:0%
Appropriations shall be reduced by that
 
09:13:10.248 --> 09:13:10.258 align:start position:0%
provider type share of the lump sum
 
09:13:12.408 --> 09:13:12.418 align:start position:0%
appropriation made in section one that
 
09:13:14.450 --> 09:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
12 million per year figure
 
09:13:17.510 --> 09:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
and section three that begins on line 29
 
09:13:19.490 --> 09:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
is also in this amendment but not in the
 
09:13:23.630 --> 09:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
09:13:26.510 --> 09:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
so 27 through 32 has two different
 
09:13:28.490 --> 09:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
components that are unique to this
 
09:13:33.408 --> 09:13:33.418 align:start position:0%
 
09:13:37.428 --> 09:13:37.438 align:start position:0%
you know what does what does 27 and 28
 
09:13:40.670 --> 09:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
add to the discussion what what why is
 
09:13:43.428 --> 09:13:43.438 align:start position:0%
is this something we should maintain in
 
09:13:45.888 --> 09:13:45.898 align:start position:0%
both structures is there Logic for that
 
09:13:47.868 --> 09:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
what what
 
09:13:50.330 --> 09:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
I that's a choice for the committee but
 
09:13:51.530 --> 09:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
the intent behind this and
 
09:13:52.850 --> 09:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham can correct me
 
09:13:55.728 --> 09:13:55.738 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong was to rather than adding
 
09:13:58.190 --> 09:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
the entire 24 million to the sum of all
 
09:14:00.650 --> 09:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
of these it was to reduce that by
 
09:14:09.470 --> 09:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
09:14:13.690 --> 09:14:13.700 align:start position:0%
okay and then 29 through 32.
 
09:14:16.490 --> 09:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
did we not have in the other version
 
09:14:18.708 --> 09:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
anything about adult medical day
 
09:14:20.630 --> 09:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
Services you don't have it in the other
 
09:14:22.728 --> 09:14:22.738 align:start position:0%
version no so we just missed something
 
09:14:25.248 --> 09:14:25.258 align:start position:0%
in theory
 
09:14:26.990 --> 09:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think there was a
 
09:14:30.228 --> 09:14:30.238 align:start position:0%
it's not included all right yes okay
 
09:14:33.350 --> 09:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
all right representative walner
 
09:14:35.450 --> 09:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
so over the weekend that was one of the
 
09:14:39.650 --> 09:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
that was one of the areas in the Monahan
 
09:14:39.660 --> 09:14:40.368 align:start position:0%
that was one of the areas in the Monahan
um

09:14:40.368 --> 09:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:14:43.130 --> 09:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
sheet that had it no
 
09:14:46.490 --> 09:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
no information so I did reach out to
 
09:14:49.248 --> 09:14:49.258 align:start position:0%
someone who is pretty familiar with the
 
09:14:51.772 --> 09:14:51.782 align:start position:0%
service and actually
 
09:14:56.208 --> 09:14:56.218 align:start position:0%
um has I think been a service a provider
 
09:14:59.450 --> 09:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
um at Easter Seals and
 
09:15:04.068 --> 09:15:04.078 align:start position:0%
the issue was that their rate is lower
 
09:15:08.708 --> 09:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
than the CFI rate for for medical day
 
09:15:12.888 --> 09:15:12.898 align:start position:0%
day service for uh
 
09:15:16.310 --> 09:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
the for buying a day of service
 
09:15:19.670 --> 09:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
um the CFI rate is 75 a day and the
 
09:15:23.588 --> 09:15:23.598 align:start position:0%
state planned rate is
 
09:15:28.068 --> 09:15:28.078 align:start position:0%
52.34 cents so it's it's a service that
 
09:15:30.530 --> 09:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
not many providers want to provide and
 
09:15:33.408 --> 09:15:33.418 align:start position:0%
so it was in very I mean I had no way of
 
09:15:36.112 --> 09:15:36.122 align:start position:0%
figuring out how many units of service
 
09:15:38.810 --> 09:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
they even have ever purchased because
 
09:15:40.970 --> 09:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
the rate is low so you're deeper into it
 
09:15:43.130 --> 09:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
than I am I'm still at a kind of a
 
09:15:46.490 --> 09:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
higher uh simple level I think this is
 
09:15:48.650 --> 09:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
the only paragraph that we can associate
 
09:15:51.772 --> 09:15:51.782 align:start position:0%
a cost to right and I had no way of
 
09:15:53.690 --> 09:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
figuring that out maybe the department
 
09:15:56.330 --> 09:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
could have figured that out but at this
 
09:15:57.830 --> 09:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
point it was sort of we were trying to
 
09:15:59.928 --> 09:15:59.938 align:start position:0%
put the amendment together I I just
 
09:16:02.510 --> 09:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
wonder if we need a cost because Mr
 
09:16:06.048 --> 09:16:06.058 align:start position:0%
Ripple in the in the LBA team is going
 
09:16:08.450 --> 09:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
to try to go through and count up all of
 
09:16:10.548 --> 09:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
the places that we've spent money so
 
09:16:13.068 --> 09:16:13.078 align:start position:0%
that we know what we're obligating and
 
09:16:14.748 --> 09:16:14.758 align:start position:0%
this paragraph I don't know if this is
 
09:16:17.272 --> 09:16:17.282 align:start position:0%
so tiny it's irrelevant or if we need
 
09:16:21.290 --> 09:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh a wag
 
09:16:21.300 --> 09:16:22.908 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh a wag
foreign

09:16:22.908 --> 09:16:22.918 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
09:16:24.290 --> 09:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know that you need an
 
09:16:26.868 --> 09:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
appropriation if it passes without we
 
09:16:28.310 --> 09:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
would send it to the department for
 
09:16:30.170 --> 09:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
their inputs and we would put that into
 
09:16:32.868 --> 09:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
09:16:32.878 --> 09:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

09:16:35.030 --> 09:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
09:16:38.272 --> 09:16:38.282 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative Hull
 
09:16:38.282 --> 09:16:40.010 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative Hull
so

09:16:40.010 --> 09:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:16:41.568 --> 09:16:41.578 align:start position:0%
I understand that we have an amendment
 
09:16:44.568 --> 09:16:44.578 align:start position:0%
number 1153 well we haven't gotten to it
 
09:16:46.728 --> 09:16:46.738 align:start position:0%
but could we put at the end of one of
 
09:16:47.928 --> 09:16:47.938 align:start position:0%
these amendments that the department
 
09:16:50.388 --> 09:16:50.398 align:start position:0%
could move money over to that line item
 
09:16:52.428 --> 09:16:52.438 align:start position:0%
if they needed to as a
 
09:16:55.068 --> 09:16:55.078 align:start position:0%
subsequent provision
 
09:16:57.708 --> 09:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
it was zero in the Monahan worksheet
 
09:17:01.368 --> 09:17:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
09:17:05.630 --> 09:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
09:17:08.208 --> 09:17:08.218 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea of the order of
 
09:17:10.970 --> 09:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
magnitude of that
 
09:17:12.830 --> 09:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
few lines
 
09:17:15.650 --> 09:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
I don't I I don't I'm not asking you
 
09:17:17.510 --> 09:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
because there's somebody back there this
 
09:17:20.150 --> 09:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
is Monahan available or maybe Mr Lipman
 
09:17:22.970 --> 09:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
could tell us is that is that
 
09:17:24.830 --> 09:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
are there very many units of this
 
09:17:34.850 --> 09:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
09:17:36.588 --> 09:17:36.598 align:start position:0%
I could probably provide something
 
09:17:39.470 --> 09:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
within by morning time I just I'm not
 
09:17:40.850 --> 09:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
sure I have anything on my computer here
 
09:17:42.772 --> 09:17:42.782 align:start position:0%
to give me that stat
 
09:17:42.782 --> 09:17:43.612 align:start position:0%
to give me that stat
um

09:17:43.612 --> 09:17:43.622 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:17:46.970 --> 09:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
but uh I think even just an order of
 
09:17:48.708 --> 09:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
magnitude relative to other expenses is
 
09:17:52.790 --> 09:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
it I don't think it is a multi-million
 
09:17:54.290 --> 09:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
dollar item
 
09:17:54.300 --> 09:17:55.068 align:start position:0%
dollar item
um

09:17:55.068 --> 09:17:55.078 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:17:57.408 --> 09:17:57.418 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
09:17:59.928 --> 09:17:59.938 align:start position:0%
I'd rather than just yeah okay guessing
 
09:18:01.428 --> 09:18:01.438 align:start position:0%
I think you know at least having the
 
09:18:02.810 --> 09:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
provision that represented a whole
 
09:18:04.428 --> 09:18:04.438 align:start position:0%
talked about in terms of being able to
 
09:18:06.950 --> 09:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
move money would be a good good start if
 
09:18:10.010 --> 09:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
09:18:12.830 --> 09:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
so if this was goalie locks this would
 
09:18:16.130 --> 09:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
be small too small and not just right
 
09:18:18.470 --> 09:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is the smallest of the three kind
 
09:18:22.190 --> 09:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
of orders of magnitude tiny I think it's
 
09:18:24.790 --> 09:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
in in that
 
09:18:28.990 --> 09:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
magnitude of not huge okay
 
09:18:31.970 --> 09:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
not significant
 
09:18:34.970 --> 09:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
99 years not usually not just right
 
09:18:38.990 --> 09:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe tiny go ahead in the
 
09:18:41.510 --> 09:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid State Plan home health aids
 
09:18:43.548 --> 09:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
category right looking at the initial
 
09:18:45.888 --> 09:18:45.898 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet right Medicaid Meals on
 
09:18:47.748 --> 09:18:47.758 align:start position:0%
Wheels although showed up as zero
 
09:18:50.510 --> 09:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
actually had 250 000 and this was
 
09:18:52.728 --> 09:18:52.738 align:start position:0%
actually left blank so potentially it's
 
09:18:57.068 --> 09:18:57.078 align:start position:0%
sub 250 000 in terms of dollar value
 
09:18:59.748 --> 09:18:59.758 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I was thinking three
 
09:19:01.670 --> 09:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
different things are you still talking
 
09:19:04.612 --> 09:19:04.622 align:start position:0%
about 1154 and you're making an
 
09:19:06.830 --> 09:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
observation that we may want to consider
 
09:19:09.408 --> 09:19:09.418 align:start position:0%
a change to 1154.
 
09:19:13.068 --> 09:19:13.078 align:start position:0%
no I'm observing that when he says the
 
09:19:14.870 --> 09:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
dollar amount is small if it's less than
 
09:19:16.670 --> 09:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
the other things in that same category
 
09:19:20.870 --> 09:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're probably sub 250 000. as a oh okay
 
09:19:23.630 --> 09:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
just so so this paragraph costs us less
 
09:19:30.530 --> 09:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
09:19:32.570 --> 09:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's probably a fair
 
09:19:34.970 --> 09:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
guess because you know this is general
 
09:19:36.830 --> 09:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
fund so you're talking that's a half a
 
09:19:38.510 --> 09:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars I would imagine that
 
09:19:44.510 --> 09:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
09:19:47.450 --> 09:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair go ahead
 
09:19:52.370 --> 09:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
09:19:55.970 --> 09:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
just just now I I would I would like to
 
09:19:57.950 --> 09:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
just kind of if we could just a little
 
09:20:00.110 --> 09:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
longer stay on structure we'll go
 
09:20:02.746 --> 09:20:02.756 align:start position:0%
wherever you want Oh but I'm just trying
 
09:20:04.730 --> 09:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
to make sure we crosswalk the structure
 
09:20:07.550 --> 09:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
right so I'm I was going to suggest that
 
09:20:09.950 --> 09:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to we could look at a
 
09:20:12.530 --> 09:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral 22
 
09:20:16.850 --> 09:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
at the end which allows for right the
 
09:20:20.870 --> 09:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS can supplement out of right adult
 
09:20:23.746 --> 09:20:23.756 align:start position:0%
mental sorry adult medical day Services
 
09:20:27.310 --> 09:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
up to 250 000 out of some other
 
09:20:29.210 --> 09:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
Department's funding or something
 
09:20:32.210 --> 09:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking so we're
 
09:20:37.246 --> 09:20:37.256 align:start position:0%
we've at least have a section in 11 53 H
 
09:20:39.830 --> 09:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
that is similar not exactly the same
 
09:20:42.650 --> 09:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
verbatim as 11 54 H in terms of covering
 
09:20:47.150 --> 09:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:20:51.290 --> 09:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
did you follow that
 
09:20:53.150 --> 09:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
um no
 
09:20:57.350 --> 09:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
so my proposal is right on a lines 1154h
 
09:21:00.406 --> 09:21:00.416 align:start position:0%
which is the Wallner proposal for this
 
09:21:03.770 --> 09:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
they fund at some level the adult
 
09:21:06.290 --> 09:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
medical day service so give me a page
 
09:21:07.906 --> 09:21:07.916 align:start position:0%
and line number that's your page four
 
09:21:11.050 --> 09:21:11.060 align:start position:0%
page three lines 29 through 32
 
09:21:14.570 --> 09:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
32. take that section instead of
 
09:21:16.970 --> 09:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
duplicating the text do what I mentioned
 
09:21:19.190 --> 09:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
to Mr Ripple earlier which is give the
 
09:21:22.010 --> 09:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
department the ability to fund up to 250
 
09:21:24.586 --> 09:21:24.596 align:start position:0%
000 dollars through some other means
 
09:21:26.630 --> 09:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
right give them the ability to pull out
 
09:21:27.950 --> 09:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
of another fund to fund this if they
 
09:21:31.010 --> 09:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
want to is that easier than just copy
 
09:21:34.246 --> 09:21:34.256 align:start position:0%
and pasting lines 29 and 32 into the
 
09:21:38.650 --> 09:21:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
09:21:41.630 --> 09:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that too I know I have no
 
09:21:43.970 --> 09:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
heartache in making moving lines 29
 
09:21:48.050 --> 09:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
through 32 over to this and so
 
09:21:51.170 --> 09:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay do you do you have any issues with
 
09:21:55.370 --> 09:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
moving lines 16 through 20 over on the
 
09:21:57.406 --> 09:21:57.416 align:start position:0%
ambulance codes do you have any issues
 
09:22:00.230 --> 09:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you primarily because you
 
09:22:02.330 --> 09:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
spent more time doing the number drill
 
09:22:02.340 --> 09:22:03.550 align:start position:0%
spent more time doing the number drill
nope

09:22:03.550 --> 09:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
nope
 
09:22:07.310 --> 09:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like line 21
 
09:22:08.870 --> 09:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
is actually
 
09:22:12.950 --> 09:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
already line 12 page three that is
 
09:22:12.960 --> 09:22:13.906 align:start position:0%
already line 12 page three that is
correct

09:22:13.906 --> 09:22:13.916 align:start position:0%
correct
 
09:22:16.730 --> 09:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
so we're not moving it and the numbers
 
09:22:20.690 --> 09:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
are aligned between the the left and the
 
09:22:22.790 --> 09:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
right version correct
 
09:22:26.210 --> 09:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
it so then when we get to
 
09:22:28.850 --> 09:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
the bottom one there's a substantial
 
09:22:30.710 --> 09:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
difference in the numbers there right
 
09:22:32.990 --> 09:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
but the structure is the same correct
 
09:22:33.000 --> 09:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
but the structure is the same correct
okay

09:22:35.510 --> 09:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
09:22:38.266 --> 09:22:38.276 align:start position:0%
so just in one second
 
09:22:38.276 --> 09:22:39.950 align:start position:0%
so just in one second
so

09:22:39.950 --> 09:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:22:44.150 --> 09:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:22:47.330 --> 09:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
could we get this I'm going to propose
 
09:22:49.246 --> 09:22:49.256 align:start position:0%
it and then you can tell me if it's just
 
09:22:50.746 --> 09:22:50.756 align:start position:0%
not worth
 
09:22:53.330 --> 09:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
sending it back to OLS this late because
 
09:22:54.470 --> 09:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to finish
 
09:22:54.480 --> 09:22:56.510 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to finish
this

09:22:56.510 --> 09:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
09:22:58.610 --> 09:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
right any change we do at this point
 
09:23:01.130 --> 09:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
we're not going to turn around tonight
 
09:23:03.110 --> 09:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct
 
09:23:04.310 --> 09:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
um if there are changes that you won't
 
09:23:06.050 --> 09:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
make to this
 
09:23:08.450 --> 09:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
what I was going to see just anyway is
 
09:23:10.550 --> 09:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
that at the end of this meeting you
 
09:23:12.950 --> 09:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
recess until Friday morning in case
 
09:23:14.746 --> 09:23:14.756 align:start position:0%
which the other two divisions are doing
 
09:23:17.030 --> 09:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
as well in case there are any changes
 
09:23:19.870 --> 09:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
that need to be made to anything
 
09:23:22.730 --> 09:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
at this point this is the only potential
 
09:23:25.310 --> 09:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
change that I've I'm aware of I think so
 
09:23:27.890 --> 09:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair yes if I took a pair of
 
09:23:30.710 --> 09:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
scissors and cut lines 29 through 32 out
 
09:23:33.110 --> 09:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the amended analysis and photocopied
 
09:23:36.170 --> 09:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
it on the bottom starting at line 17 and
 
09:23:37.970 --> 09:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
we handed that out as an amendment to be
 
09:23:40.070 --> 09:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
drafted would that meet the requirements
 
09:23:43.010 --> 09:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
of at least conveying the information of
 
09:23:44.690 --> 09:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
a joint Amendment
 
09:23:48.950 --> 09:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
I I I I I I yes
 
09:23:52.670 --> 09:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
but I I want to know are we going to
 
09:23:55.010 --> 09:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
keep the ambulance codes or not oh right
 
09:23:56.926 --> 09:23:56.936 align:start position:0%
okay FairPoint
 
09:23:59.510 --> 09:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit harder to merge in
 
09:24:02.810 --> 09:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
actually it's not it's just another take
 
09:24:04.850 --> 09:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
the scissors and cut the ambulance codes
 
09:24:06.890 --> 09:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
and paste it over there I think
 
09:24:09.530 --> 09:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
nonetheless this is a
 
09:24:11.570 --> 09:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
this is a big Amendment and maybe you
 
09:24:13.246 --> 09:24:13.256 align:start position:0%
want to see the final
 
09:24:15.406 --> 09:24:15.416 align:start position:0%
the final version of it
 
09:24:17.266 --> 09:24:17.276 align:start position:0%
um so if you recess until Friday morning
 
09:24:18.890 --> 09:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
anyway division three is meeting on
 
09:24:21.766 --> 09:24:21.776 align:start position:0%
bills anyway I can give you the revised
 
09:24:23.150 --> 09:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
version at that time
 
09:24:25.906 --> 09:24:25.916 align:start position:0%
okay should I ask that question go ahead
 
09:24:28.906 --> 09:24:28.916 align:start position:0%
so in the meantime you may have some
 
09:24:31.790 --> 09:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
other numbers on the on the gef freed
 
09:24:33.950 --> 09:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
upside that we could also consider on
 
09:24:33.960 --> 09:24:35.630 align:start position:0%
upside that we could also consider on
Friday

09:24:35.630 --> 09:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
09:24:38.330 --> 09:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
well and I think the purpose of all
 
09:24:40.426 --> 09:24:40.436 align:start position:0%
three divisions holding Friday open is
 
09:24:41.990 --> 09:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
for that very reason
 
09:24:45.426 --> 09:24:45.436 align:start position:0%
so the answer to that is yes yes okay
 
09:24:48.890 --> 09:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
awesome uh representative walner and
 
09:24:50.870 --> 09:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
ripple and irf do we have fiscal
 
09:24:53.030 --> 09:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee Friday morning
 
09:24:54.950 --> 09:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
this Friday afternoon do we have
 
09:24:57.890 --> 09:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
anything going on Friday morning
 
09:24:57.900 --> 09:25:03.950 align:start position:0%
anything going on Friday morning
what

09:25:03.950 --> 09:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
09:25:05.746 --> 09:25:05.756 align:start position:0%
we have four bills
 
09:25:07.730 --> 09:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
and what time are we meeting on the
 
09:25:07.740 --> 09:25:08.810 align:start position:0%
and what time are we meeting on the
bills

09:25:08.810 --> 09:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
bills
 
09:25:17.810 --> 09:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
09:25:22.150 --> 09:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
so it feels to me like we want to
 
09:25:26.086 --> 09:25:26.096 align:start position:0%
convene recess this until 8 30 Friday
 
09:25:26.096 --> 09:25:28.010 align:start position:0%
convene recess this until 8 30 Friday
morning

09:25:28.010 --> 09:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
morning
 
09:25:31.550 --> 09:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
that way we have an hour where we can
 
09:25:34.730 --> 09:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
look at this representative pilersky is
 
09:25:36.530 --> 09:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
that a issue with you
 
09:25:38.570 --> 09:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
no I've just been wanting to ask a
 
09:25:41.210 --> 09:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
question for a number of hours oh for a
 
09:25:43.010 --> 09:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
number of hours yes a number of hours
 
09:25:44.926 --> 09:25:44.936 align:start position:0%
ago I wanted to ask representative a
 
09:25:46.790 --> 09:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
question and you said not at this time
 
09:25:48.586 --> 09:25:48.596 align:start position:0%
we're staying on track and it has to do
 
09:25:49.970 --> 09:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
with his Amendment and how they brought
 
09:25:51.650 --> 09:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
got to the numbers and I just would like
 
09:25:54.170 --> 09:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
a clarify no go for it
 
09:25:54.180 --> 09:25:56.266 align:start position:0%
a clarify no go for it
thanks

09:25:56.266 --> 09:25:56.276 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
09:25:56.276 --> 09:25:57.650 align:start position:0%
thanks
so

09:25:57.650 --> 09:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:26:01.070 --> 09:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
when representative hole was running all
 
09:26:02.690 --> 09:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
of his numbers and you were talking
 
09:26:04.670 --> 09:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
about the ratios and can we just be
 
09:26:06.586 --> 09:26:06.596 align:start position:0%
clear that we you know we or the
 
09:26:09.170 --> 09:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
approach of how we're doing it my
 
09:26:10.850 --> 09:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
question was
 
09:26:14.330 --> 09:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
you started the day with
 
09:26:17.510 --> 09:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
now I forget your term about five or six
 
09:26:20.210 --> 09:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
things that you said we're gonna hold
 
09:26:24.050 --> 09:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
constant hold constant and then as in
 
09:26:26.630 --> 09:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
the Monahan numbers would stand and then
 
09:26:28.970 --> 09:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
the rest would be a ratio based on what
 
09:26:32.086 --> 09:26:32.096 align:start position:0%
they are so my question was were your
 
09:26:35.810 --> 09:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
numbers in this amendment developed with
 
09:26:39.766 --> 09:26:39.776 align:start position:0%
those cherry-picked categories on a hold
 
09:26:42.050 --> 09:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
and everything else
 
09:26:45.050 --> 09:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
fluctuated at a different Ratio or was
 
09:26:47.926 --> 09:26:47.936 align:start position:0%
everything done on the same sort of
 
09:26:49.370 --> 09:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
balance did you take our numbers and
 
09:26:51.290 --> 09:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
then go down a percentage no I did it
 
09:26:52.906 --> 09:26:52.916 align:start position:0%
the way I described or we did it I
 
09:26:54.766 --> 09:26:54.776 align:start position:0%
actually said it rubs on a hole did it
 
09:26:56.746 --> 09:26:56.756 align:start position:0%
based on the philosophy I explained to
 
09:26:59.510 --> 09:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
you so those whatever was half a dozen
 
09:27:01.630 --> 09:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
categories I think whatever they were
 
09:27:03.766 --> 09:27:03.776 align:start position:0%
they were fully funded at whatever
 
09:27:05.266 --> 09:27:05.276 align:start position:0%
numbers were in there
 
09:27:07.190 --> 09:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
that was what I meant by hold constant
 
09:27:08.870 --> 09:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
so they were funded at their relatively
 
09:27:11.630 --> 09:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
low levels and that was that as far as
 
09:27:12.710 --> 09:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
those go
 
09:27:14.990 --> 09:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
the others were then proportionally
 
09:27:18.350 --> 09:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted within the remaining 40 million
 
09:27:20.746 --> 09:27:20.756 align:start position:0%
dollars per year it's minus the part
 
09:27:22.150 --> 09:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
that we'd already
 
09:27:24.406 --> 09:27:24.416 align:start position:0%
appropriate does that make sense that
 
09:27:27.170 --> 09:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
does make sense and I guess I just
 
09:27:30.230 --> 09:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
um don't know if we ever got an
 
09:27:33.830 --> 09:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
explanation on how you picked which ones
 
09:27:37.970 --> 09:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
were held we can do that yeah right now
 
09:27:41.450 --> 09:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
no it isn't it's too late now why is it
 
09:27:43.810 --> 09:27:43.820 align:start position:0%
too late my dog
 
09:27:45.830 --> 09:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
where we're at I just wanted to
 
09:27:47.030 --> 09:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
understand no no it's a very simple
 
09:27:48.110 --> 09:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
explanation though I mean they're
 
09:27:49.850 --> 09:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
basically small ones that's and I did
 
09:27:52.130 --> 09:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
say that this morning as well it was a
 
09:27:53.810 --> 09:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
long time ago so I apologize that's okay
 
09:27:55.610 --> 09:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
no that's no problem so they were
 
09:27:57.650 --> 09:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
relatively tiny amounts
 
09:28:01.670 --> 09:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
like The Midwives the ambulance
 
09:28:01.680 --> 09:28:02.690 align:start position:0%
like The Midwives the ambulance
um

09:28:02.690 --> 09:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:28:05.746 --> 09:28:05.756 align:start position:0%
the community health centers uh and then
 
09:28:07.310 --> 09:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's the specialized one which is not
 
09:28:07.320 --> 09:28:08.086 align:start position:0%
there's the specialized one which is not
so

09:28:08.086 --> 09:28:08.096 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:28:11.210 --> 09:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
um low the 3-3 which was uh Mr lippman
 
09:28:13.370 --> 09:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
um helped me hear the granite
 
09:28:15.530 --> 09:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
the GS
 
09:28:17.570 --> 09:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
and and that one was special as I
 
09:28:19.070 --> 09:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
understood it because of the particular
 
09:28:21.290 --> 09:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
Services they provided and how few
 
09:28:22.550 --> 09:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
people will
 
09:28:26.266 --> 09:28:26.276 align:start position:0%
uh uh do them I think the biggest one
 
09:28:28.970 --> 09:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
you kept constant was the rebasing at
 
09:28:30.650 --> 09:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
six and there was a rebasing exactly
 
09:28:31.906 --> 09:28:31.916 align:start position:0%
that's the other thing which as I
 
09:28:33.650 --> 09:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
understand it had to happen at that
 
09:28:33.660 --> 09:28:36.530 align:start position:0%
understand it had to happen at that
level

09:28:36.530 --> 09:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
09:28:38.746 --> 09:28:38.756 align:start position:0%
so so there was some cherry picking but
 
09:28:41.450 --> 09:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
it wasn't without some discretion it was
 
09:28:44.086 --> 09:28:44.096 align:start position:0%
more they were the smaller amounts and
 
09:28:46.010 --> 09:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
and the rebasing
 
09:28:46.020 --> 09:28:46.850 align:start position:0%
and the rebasing
okay

09:28:46.850 --> 09:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
09:28:48.710 --> 09:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
that was my question and I thank the
 
09:28:50.746 --> 09:28:50.756 align:start position:0%
committee for indulging I thank you for
 
09:28:52.490 --> 09:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
holding on to that question I do too
 
09:28:54.710 --> 09:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
this time I would have exploded 12 times
 
09:28:58.390 --> 09:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
09:29:01.010 --> 09:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
no I apologize I thought I had explained
 
09:29:02.390 --> 09:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
I didn't do a very good job and I that
 
09:29:05.086 --> 09:29:05.096 align:start position:0%
was my that was my bad okay so so let's
 
09:29:08.450 --> 09:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
let's let's walk over to
 
09:29:11.030 --> 09:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
11 53 a second
 
09:29:15.470 --> 09:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
the uh section one is the same it's the
 
09:29:18.830 --> 09:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
12 12 and both amendments the the first
 
09:29:21.530 --> 09:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
paragraph is the same amount of money 24
 
09:29:24.010 --> 09:29:24.020 align:start position:0%
between the two years
 
09:29:29.690 --> 09:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the 1154 Amendment I heard
 
09:29:32.510 --> 09:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham say that they
 
09:29:36.406 --> 09:29:36.416 align:start position:0%
allocated another 151 million across all
 
09:29:39.586 --> 09:29:39.596 align:start position:0%
of the paragraphs and we're now at the
 
09:29:41.570 --> 09:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
point where our paragraphs are the same
 
09:29:43.850 --> 09:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
paragraphs as between the two of them
 
09:29:48.050 --> 09:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
you did 151 million plus the 24 to get
 
09:29:51.530 --> 09:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
the 175 you mentioned right so let's
 
09:29:56.870 --> 09:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
let's do the same numbers on on the 1153
 
09:30:00.170 --> 09:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
how much What's the total of this I
 
09:30:03.230 --> 09:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
think Mr Ripple you did some homework
 
09:30:03.240 --> 09:30:04.670 align:start position:0%
think Mr Ripple you did some homework
mm-hmm

09:30:04.670 --> 09:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
09:30:07.850 --> 09:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
09:30:10.246 --> 09:30:10.256 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 24 appropriation the fiscal
 
09:30:12.530 --> 09:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
25 appropriation and the the amount
 
09:30:14.266 --> 09:30:14.276 align:start position:0%
that's available to the department to
 
09:30:17.330 --> 09:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
expend before January 1st if possible
 
09:30:21.530 --> 09:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
is about 70.2 million dollars so and of
 
09:30:25.010 --> 09:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
that 70.2 million
 
09:30:29.690 --> 09:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
the 24 that's in Section 1 is that part
 
09:30:33.110 --> 09:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the 70 so our Delta is more like 40
 
09:30:37.010 --> 09:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
something or is the 24 on top of the 70
 
09:30:41.690 --> 09:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
for 94. the 24 is on top of the 70.
 
09:30:46.670 --> 09:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay so Apples to Apples then we
 
09:30:50.470 --> 09:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
we I'm sorry 1153 invests
 
09:30:53.950 --> 09:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
70.2 million in the
 
09:30:57.290 --> 09:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
yes two million in individual ratings
 
09:31:02.746 --> 09:31:02.756 align:start position:0%
and the 1154 does 151
 
09:31:07.130 --> 09:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
so you know we're only off by a factor
 
09:31:08.150 --> 09:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
of two
 
09:31:10.310 --> 09:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
so that's that's I for a while I thought
 
09:31:12.406 --> 09:31:12.416 align:start position:0%
it was going to be a factor of four so
 
09:31:14.630 --> 09:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
this is pretty good now I don't I don't
 
09:31:17.330 --> 09:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think these numbers are locked
 
09:31:19.790 --> 09:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
either in either category because we're
 
09:31:22.070 --> 09:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
going to come back at 8 30 on Friday
 
09:31:24.586 --> 09:31:24.596 align:start position:0%
we're going to see the new scorecard
 
09:31:26.810 --> 09:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
we'll have a little bit idea of whether
 
09:31:29.570 --> 09:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
or not we can toy with the numbers but
 
09:31:32.330 --> 09:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
at this point the structure is set and
 
09:31:35.510 --> 09:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the basic math is set and if we have
 
09:31:38.810 --> 09:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
extra money or God forbid less money we
 
09:31:41.450 --> 09:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
at least have a way to apply like an
 
09:31:43.670 --> 09:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
algorithm to get to what the number
 
09:31:45.586 --> 09:31:45.596 align:start position:0%
needs to be based on the availability
 
09:31:50.390 --> 09:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
funds right yes representative can you
 
09:31:51.650 --> 09:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
just repeat for me
 
09:31:53.266 --> 09:31:53.276 align:start position:0%
um I was right I wrote it a certain way
 
09:31:56.266 --> 09:31:56.276 align:start position:0%
on the walner amendment is we had the
 
09:31:58.670 --> 09:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
original 24 in section one and then we
 
09:32:03.766 --> 09:32:03.776 align:start position:0%
had 151 for a total of 175 on your
 
09:32:06.890 --> 09:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment you have the 24 and then what
 
09:32:10.870 --> 09:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
was the next amount that
 
09:32:14.530 --> 09:32:14.540 align:start position:0%
70.2 so our total is
 
09:32:18.710 --> 09:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
94.2 and yours was 175. thank you I
 
09:32:20.210 --> 09:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it was the going back
 
09:32:23.690 --> 09:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
and forth I lost it okay
 
09:32:28.490 --> 09:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
all right so while we're in session
 
09:32:30.890 --> 09:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
what what do you propose on these do you
 
09:32:33.350 --> 09:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
want to like do anything to these two
 
09:32:36.350 --> 09:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
amendments or or just wait to us for
 
09:32:39.230 --> 09:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
Friday so
 
09:32:40.850 --> 09:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
here's what here's what I would suggest
 
09:32:42.766 --> 09:32:42.776 align:start position:0%
I would suggest taking a vote today with
 
09:32:44.330 --> 09:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
any changes that you would like me to
 
09:32:44.340 --> 09:32:45.650 align:start position:0%
any changes that you would like me to
make

09:32:45.650 --> 09:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
make
 
09:32:49.670 --> 09:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and we'll accept that as as the as
 
09:32:51.650 --> 09:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
the division's action and I'll bring
 
09:32:53.690 --> 09:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
back to you the revised Amendment on
 
09:32:55.550 --> 09:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
Friday and if you want any changes to
 
09:32:57.406 --> 09:32:57.416 align:start position:0%
that you can vote to have those made
 
09:33:00.110 --> 09:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
then so so we're going to send you one
 
09:33:02.450 --> 09:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
or the other not both and we're going to
 
09:33:04.246 --> 09:33:04.256 align:start position:0%
tell you any number changes that we want
 
09:33:06.530 --> 09:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
to make that's correct okay
 
09:33:06.540 --> 09:33:07.850 align:start position:0%
to make that's correct okay
so

09:33:07.850 --> 09:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:33:10.426 --> 09:33:10.436 align:start position:0%
we've nordgren representative nordgren
 
09:33:14.510 --> 09:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
09:33:19.670 --> 09:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
09:33:22.906 --> 09:33:22.916 align:start position:0%
we don't know yet yeah but but you know
 
09:33:26.030 --> 09:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
some of the big chunks we we we got we
 
09:33:28.370 --> 09:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
started with sort of 40. so there's
 
09:33:29.990 --> 09:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
money as they came out of the DD
 
09:33:30.000 --> 09:33:31.550 align:start position:0%
money as they came out of the DD
accounts

09:33:31.550 --> 09:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
09:33:34.850 --> 09:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
there's the back of the budget issue
 
09:33:37.906 --> 09:33:37.916 align:start position:0%
related to General funds uh appropriated
 
09:33:40.550 --> 09:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
by to the state
 
09:33:40.560 --> 09:33:42.766 align:start position:0%
by to the state
um there's

09:33:42.766 --> 09:33:42.776 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
09:33:45.530 --> 09:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
the sununu centerpiece 10 million
 
09:33:47.450 --> 09:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
dollars if that's still ours or is it
 
09:33:51.290 --> 09:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
09:33:52.850 --> 09:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
the construction of a Noosa new center
 
09:33:54.650 --> 09:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a 10 million so that's 10
 
09:33:54.660 --> 09:33:56.086 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a 10 million so that's 10
million

09:33:56.086 --> 09:33:56.096 align:start position:0%
million
 
09:33:58.550 --> 09:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and then there's a variety of smaller
 
09:34:00.290 --> 09:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
ones one and a half million here three
 
09:34:02.150 --> 09:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
million there a bunch of those that we
 
09:34:03.530 --> 09:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
were kicking out and even some smaller
 
09:34:06.110 --> 09:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
than that 400 000 that sort of thing
 
09:34:09.710 --> 09:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
my impression was we we funded 1153 by
 
09:34:11.150 --> 09:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
going through all these things you
 
09:34:15.350 --> 09:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
brought up but 1154 needs more money and
 
09:34:18.950 --> 09:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
09:34:20.870 --> 09:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment representative
 
09:34:22.906 --> 09:34:22.916 align:start position:0%
stream well yeah
 
09:34:25.246 --> 09:34:25.256 align:start position:0%
at least my understanding
 
09:34:28.190 --> 09:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
you mean 1154 needs more money to get up
 
09:34:28.200 --> 09:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
you mean 1154 needs more money to get up
to

09:34:29.510 --> 09:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
09:34:32.810 --> 09:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
well our budget you spent more money in
 
09:34:35.990 --> 09:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
1154 than we spent 1153 but
 
09:34:37.850 --> 09:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative era found lots of places
 
09:34:40.970 --> 09:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
to save money to put into it right so
 
09:34:43.370 --> 09:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
you would need to save more money to put
 
09:34:46.310 --> 09:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
in more money and I don't see that where
 
09:34:49.130 --> 09:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
09:34:53.450 --> 09:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
so so can I summarize that I I I think
 
09:34:55.670 --> 09:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative erf basically just
 
09:34:57.830 --> 09:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
explained that we probably can account
 
09:35:00.230 --> 09:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
for our 94.2
 
09:35:03.290 --> 09:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
in terms of finding Bill payers for them
 
09:35:07.130 --> 09:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
and and if if if you had those same bill
 
09:35:10.010 --> 09:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
payers then you're you're you're still
 
09:35:13.610 --> 09:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
short about uh 80 million and if you
 
09:35:16.130 --> 09:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
came back and said okay we can get this
 
09:35:18.650 --> 09:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
80 million by reducing these other
 
09:35:21.890 --> 09:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
things I I I don't know I'd I'd be sort
 
09:35:23.230 --> 09:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
of open to that discussion
 
09:35:26.690 --> 09:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative erf so that's one
 
09:35:29.030 --> 09:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
way to view it the other way to view
 
09:35:31.610 --> 09:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
which I have been viewing it is the 40
 
09:35:33.830 --> 09:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
million with just a plug number
 
09:35:35.870 --> 09:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
to build a structure
 
09:35:38.330 --> 09:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
and when we total up all those other
 
09:35:40.010 --> 09:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
pieces which is what's going to happen
 
09:35:41.510 --> 09:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
tonight I believe
 
09:35:43.610 --> 09:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
so we'll know before Friday what that
 
09:35:46.246 --> 09:35:46.256 align:start position:0%
total is I Envision that that total
 
09:35:47.810 --> 09:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
would become the Top Line the
 
09:35:49.426 --> 09:35:49.436 align:start position:0%
replacement for the 40 million I believe
 
09:35:51.586 --> 09:35:51.596 align:start position:0%
it will be more than 40 million I don't
 
09:35:53.510 --> 09:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
know the number though I don't know that
 
09:35:56.570 --> 09:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
it'll be as high as 100 million per year
 
09:35:58.550 --> 09:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
but but that's sort of the way I was
 
09:36:01.426 --> 09:36:01.436 align:start position:0%
envisioning this whole thing oh okay so
 
09:36:05.390 --> 09:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
so we have to be picked between uh 53
 
09:36:06.906 --> 09:36:06.916 align:start position:0%
and 54.
 
09:36:11.150 --> 09:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
and I what I what I I told
 
09:36:12.950 --> 09:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham we'd consider
 
09:36:16.190 --> 09:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
his Amendment first so I I think we can
 
09:36:19.246 --> 09:36:19.256 align:start position:0%
take a straw vote on uh whether we
 
09:36:22.310 --> 09:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
support 1154.
 
09:36:26.350 --> 09:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of supporting 1154
 
09:36:26.360 --> 09:36:28.246 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of supporting 1154
opposed

09:36:28.246 --> 09:36:28.256 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
09:36:31.730 --> 09:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
okay so all those in favor of supporting
 
09:36:34.070 --> 09:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna throw the disclaimer
 
09:36:37.670 --> 09:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
in on 11 53 I'd like to do those cut and
 
09:36:40.730 --> 09:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
pastes or not I'd like to see the
 
09:36:44.330 --> 09:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
structure the same as 11 54. okay Mr
 
09:36:46.246 --> 09:36:46.256 align:start position:0%
chair I just kind of sketched in right
 
09:36:50.230 --> 09:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
where we are grabbing sections from 1154
 
09:36:52.970 --> 09:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
lines page three lines 14 through 20
 
09:36:54.950 --> 09:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
starting it notwithstanding and then
 
09:36:57.110 --> 09:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
grabbing subsequently lines 29 through
 
09:36:57.120 --> 09:36:58.310 align:start position:0%
grabbing subsequently lines 29 through
32.

09:36:58.310 --> 09:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
32.
 
09:37:00.890 --> 09:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
and those get amended into this so we
 
09:37:03.586 --> 09:37:03.596 align:start position:0%
have a document that we're working with
 
09:37:06.050 --> 09:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
I I think we're looking at it the same
 
09:37:08.630 --> 09:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna we don't have to use our
 
09:37:10.790 --> 09:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
imagination because Friday we're going
 
09:37:14.870 --> 09:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
to see a document at 8 30 that has these
 
09:37:19.370 --> 09:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
numbers but the structure of 1154 so
 
09:37:22.670 --> 09:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's right
 
09:37:25.426 --> 09:37:25.436 align:start position:0%
it'll be this amendment it'll be 1153
 
09:37:29.210 --> 09:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
plus the ambulance rates and the uh
 
09:37:29.220 --> 09:37:33.370 align:start position:0%
plus the ambulance rates and the uh
foreign

09:37:33.370 --> 09:37:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
09:37:36.766 --> 09:37:36.776 align:start position:0%
at the end of 11 50
 
09:37:40.370 --> 09:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
oh four okay you uh represent Waller and
 
09:37:41.330 --> 09:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
when will
 
09:37:45.950 --> 09:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry when will we see how much
 
09:37:49.310 --> 09:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
has either been saved or
 
09:37:51.830 --> 09:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
spent I mean yes yes ma'am I think the
 
09:37:53.990 --> 09:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
answer is Friday morning at 8 30 because
 
09:37:56.990 --> 09:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think the LBA is going to take all the
 
09:37:58.970 --> 09:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
work of the divisions and put it all
 
09:38:02.266 --> 09:38:02.276 align:start position:0%
into the compilator and and turn it into
 
09:38:05.926 --> 09:38:05.936 align:start position:0%
uh a balance yeah okay
 
09:38:05.936 --> 09:38:07.246 align:start position:0%
uh a balance yeah okay
okay

09:38:07.246 --> 09:38:07.256 align:start position:0%
okay
 
09:38:09.710 --> 09:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
yes we are going to do that
 
09:38:12.710 --> 09:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and Mike Mike handle send out a
 
09:38:14.330 --> 09:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
revised sheet I'm not sure when that
 
09:38:15.830 --> 09:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
will be I think it'll be before Friday
 
09:38:15.840 --> 09:38:16.790 align:start position:0%
will be I think it'll be before Friday
morning

09:38:16.790 --> 09:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
morning
 
09:38:18.710 --> 09:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
and based on that we're going to have to
 
09:38:22.130 --> 09:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
adjust fire to to hit the number I think
 
09:38:24.830 --> 09:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and so we're coming back at 8 30.
 
09:38:26.230 --> 09:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
09:38:29.450 --> 09:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative norgren comes a long way
 
09:38:33.470 --> 09:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
and she's going home late yeah could we
 
09:38:37.070 --> 09:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
maybe meet at 9 30 in we we have a 9 30
 
09:38:40.906 --> 09:38:40.916 align:start position:0%
pre-fiscal so I I I'm trying to make
 
09:38:44.510 --> 09:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm sorry
 
09:38:44.520 --> 09:38:45.670 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm sorry
um

09:38:45.670 --> 09:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:38:49.070 --> 09:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
now we started off with an 85 million
 
09:38:50.746 --> 09:38:50.756 align:start position:0%
dollar difference then we've added a lot
 
09:38:53.210 --> 09:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
more 50 bills that wanted to spend more
 
09:38:53.220 --> 09:38:54.350 align:start position:0%
more 50 bills that wanted to spend more
money

09:38:54.350 --> 09:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
09:38:54.360 --> 09:38:55.550 align:start position:0%
money
so

09:38:55.550 --> 09:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
09:38:58.246 --> 09:38:58.256 align:start position:0%
we started off trying to make cuts
 
09:39:00.830 --> 09:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
and trying to get inside of that 85
 
09:39:03.290 --> 09:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
million so we were closer to the figures
 
09:39:06.110 --> 09:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
we had to eliminate a lot of things I
 
09:39:07.906 --> 09:39:07.916 align:start position:0%
don't think we've eliminated as much in
 
09:39:09.890 --> 09:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
this division as the other divisions
 
09:39:12.586 --> 09:39:12.596 align:start position:0%
have so
 
09:39:15.050 --> 09:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not making many Cuts
 
09:39:15.060 --> 09:39:18.050 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not making many Cuts
here

09:39:18.050 --> 09:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
09:39:21.490 --> 09:39:21.500 align:start position:0%
that's true uh I think that's true
 
09:39:23.746 --> 09:39:23.756 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
09:39:26.510 --> 09:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
um chairman Weiler fiscals meeting from
 
09:39:29.210 --> 09:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
one two do you have any idea
 
09:39:31.850 --> 09:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fairly extensive uh of
 
09:39:33.586 --> 09:39:33.596 align:start position:0%
course a lot of its consent calendar and
 
09:39:35.150 --> 09:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
then there's three
 
09:39:35.160 --> 09:39:35.766 align:start position:0%
then there's three
um

09:39:35.766 --> 09:39:35.776 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:39:37.670 --> 09:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
audits or two of them are management
 
09:39:39.650 --> 09:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
letters it's going to be
 
09:39:42.406 --> 09:39:42.416 align:start position:0%
two and a half hours likely I I was only
 
09:39:44.266 --> 09:39:44.276 align:start position:0%
asking in respect to representative
 
09:39:47.630 --> 09:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
norgren if we went for can we meet at 4
 
09:39:50.746 --> 09:39:50.756 align:start position:0%
30 instead of 8 30 a.m make Friday night
 
09:39:54.110 --> 09:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
09:39:55.790 --> 09:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
um no I think there's we got to do this
 
09:39:57.830 --> 09:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
Friday morning we there is no such thing
 
09:39:59.630 --> 09:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
as Friday afternoon to turn around
 
09:40:01.730 --> 09:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
changes is there
 
09:40:03.586 --> 09:40:03.596 align:start position:0%
we have to do this Friday morning I
 
09:40:03.596 --> 09:40:05.746 align:start position:0%
we have to do this Friday morning I
think

09:40:05.746 --> 09:40:05.756 align:start position:0%
think
 
09:40:08.390 --> 09:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
I I think if a Friday afternoon worked
 
09:40:10.550 --> 09:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
best for the committee you could do that
 
09:40:14.746 --> 09:40:14.756 align:start position:0%
 
09:40:17.390 --> 09:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
right now our exact sorry right now our
 
09:40:20.810 --> 09:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
exec starts at 10. do we expect that
 
09:40:23.510 --> 09:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
will go all the way through to lunch or
 
09:40:25.610 --> 09:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
one o'clock could we we only have four
 
09:40:25.620 --> 09:40:27.490 align:start position:0%
one o'clock could we we only have four
bills

09:40:27.490 --> 09:40:27.500 align:start position:0%
bills
 
09:40:31.310 --> 09:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing a lot of controversy uh I
 
09:40:36.350 --> 09:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know I I could imagine us being done
 
09:40:39.650 --> 09:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
we we never go as fast as I imagine but
 
09:40:42.050 --> 09:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
I think we'll be done in 90 minutes or
 
09:40:44.926 --> 09:40:44.936 align:start position:0%
less could we start at 9 30
 
09:40:47.926 --> 09:40:47.936 align:start position:0%
then stop to do our exact at 10 and then
 
09:40:50.450 --> 09:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
return and finish up before lunch or is
 
09:40:52.130 --> 09:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
that too confusing we still have
 
09:40:54.050 --> 09:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
pre-fiscal at 9 30. oh I'm sorry I
 
09:40:57.050 --> 09:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
missed I forgot that my
 
09:40:58.850 --> 09:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
it's enough on the schedule it might
 
09:41:02.230 --> 09:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
09:41:06.830 --> 09:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
so eight 8 30 is a problem
 
09:41:10.790 --> 09:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
you sure is it light when you drive when
 
09:41:15.830 --> 09:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
09:41:18.406 --> 09:41:18.416 align:start position:0%
at nine and we don't finish in half an
 
09:41:19.670 --> 09:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
hour then we couldn't we just come back
 
09:41:22.070 --> 09:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
after our morning bills which would
 
09:41:25.550 --> 09:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
09:41:28.790 --> 09:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
sure but I I just want to wrap things up
 
09:41:31.370 --> 09:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
and be done but you know this will just
 
09:41:33.950 --> 09:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
restrain your talking
 
09:41:35.690 --> 09:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
well because you would just talk a lot
 
09:41:37.970 --> 09:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
anyway if we came in at 8 30. I might
 
09:41:40.070 --> 09:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
talk a lot no matter what time we show
 
09:41:41.510 --> 09:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
up right so does it helped to constrain
 
09:41:42.860 --> 09:41:42.870 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
09:41:42.870 --> 09:41:44.330 align:start position:0%
that yeah
[Music]

09:41:44.330 --> 09:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
09:41:46.670 --> 09:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead
 
09:41:48.890 --> 09:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
I think that representative has a great
 
09:41:50.330 --> 09:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
suggestion I don't think our exec
 
09:41:52.850 --> 09:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
session will last too long at 10 o'clock
 
09:41:54.950 --> 09:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
this Friday and I think then we can
 
09:42:01.810 --> 09:42:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
09:42:05.990 --> 09:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay so people want to start at nine
 
09:42:08.870 --> 09:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
09:42:10.426 --> 09:42:10.436 align:start position:0%
I'll be you'll be you won't be here at
 
09:42:10.436 --> 09:42:13.850 align:start position:0%
I'll be you'll be you won't be here at
nine

09:42:13.850 --> 09:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
09:42:16.130 --> 09:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
could we review the amendments
 
09:42:18.650 --> 09:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
knowing rep representative Weiler will
 
09:42:21.290 --> 09:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
be returning to vote afterwards yeah
 
09:42:21.300 --> 09:42:22.790 align:start position:0%
be returning to vote afterwards yeah
I'm

09:42:22.790 --> 09:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
09:42:26.450 --> 09:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
sure so we'll meet at nine o'clock
 
09:42:28.310 --> 09:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
for all of us who can meet at nine
 
09:42:30.530 --> 09:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
o'clock then a bunch of us have to leave
 
09:42:34.310 --> 09:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
at 9 30. so hopefully we can do what we
 
09:42:36.950 --> 09:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
need to do in those 30 minutes and then
 
09:42:38.870 --> 09:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have some recess opportunities
 
09:42:42.530 --> 09:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
09:42:46.490 --> 09:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
09:42:46.500 --> 09:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
um

09:42:48.230 --> 09:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
09:42:51.710 --> 09:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
so we have not actually voted on 1153 I
 
09:42:53.630 --> 09:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
think there's an implication but all
 
09:42:56.690 --> 09:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
those in favor of 1153 raise your hand
 
09:42:56.700 --> 09:42:59.086 align:start position:0%
those in favor of 1153 raise your hand
well

09:42:59.086 --> 09:42:59.096 align:start position:0%
well
 
09:43:02.150 --> 09:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
as amended yeah
 
09:43:04.610 --> 09:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
okay opposed
 
09:43:07.550 --> 09:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
09:43:10.246 --> 09:43:10.256 align:start position:0%
so now we've done all of the voting we
 
09:43:12.190 --> 09:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
need to do today
 
09:43:14.510 --> 09:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think we've done all the voting we
 
09:43:16.550 --> 09:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
need to do you've got all of the input
 
09:43:17.926 --> 09:43:17.936 align:start position:0%
that you need
 
09:43:17.936 --> 09:43:19.370 align:start position:0%
that you need
yes

09:43:19.370 --> 09:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
09:43:22.970 --> 09:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
okay all right so you want to remind
 
09:43:25.070 --> 09:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
everyone yes I'd like to remind everyone
 
09:43:27.586 --> 09:43:27.596 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's session starts at 9 00 a.m
 
09:43:32.150 --> 09:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
09:43:35.086 --> 09:43:35.096 align:start position:0%
yeah all right I I just want to tell you
 
09:43:36.830 --> 09:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think we should feel good about
 
09:43:39.710 --> 09:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves to a very large extent because
 
09:43:42.530 --> 09:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
we just no what we just did was the
 
09:43:42.540 --> 09:43:43.490 align:start position:0%
we just no what we just did was the
governor

09:43:43.490 --> 09:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
governor
 
09:43:46.670 --> 09:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
he didn't do any of this additional uh
 
09:43:48.890 --> 09:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
rate hikes he said the house could take
 
09:43:52.086 --> 09:43:52.096 align:start position:0%
that on and we actually have
 
09:43:54.766 --> 09:43:54.776 align:start position:0%
framework that we've agreed to it's just
 
09:43:56.330 --> 09:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount we've got to finalize
 
09:43:58.426 --> 09:43:58.436 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Monahan for your work yeah
 
09:44:03.230 --> 09:44:03.240 align:start position:0%

so all right thank you
 
09:44:10.490 --> 09:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
