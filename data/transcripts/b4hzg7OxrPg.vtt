00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon folks this is the
 
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for House Bill 587
 
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
I'm called a meeting to order it uh one
 
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
105. the intent of Health Bill 587 was
 
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.630 align:start position:0%
105. the intent of Health Bill 587 was
to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
create a donor registry for anatomic
 
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
gifts if you will basically if you are a
 
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire that you could
 
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
designate your organs to go to at
 
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
preferred also resident of New Hampshire
 
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of the bill
 
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
what I also wanted to share with folks
 
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
here today is the fact that I have some
 
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 align:start position:0%
documents I emailed to you folks I also
 
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
have some documents that were
 
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
shared with us from the organization is
 
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are some handouts I res you
 
00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
receive via email prior to this meeting
 
00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
along with a handout that came from the
 
00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.450 align:start position:0%
along with a handout that came from the
um

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
which organization
 
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
so the sense of time this bill was
 
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.690 align:start position:0%
so the sense of time this bill was
introduced

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
to literally a few days ago there has
 
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
been progress made at the federal level
 
00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 align:start position:0%
and the federal government now has
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
allowed or will be allowing CMS to open
 
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
up what was considered to be a monopoly
 
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
um on the
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
distribution or the assignment of organs
 
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
if you will to open it up to with a call
 
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
competitive marketing
 
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
competitive marketing
 
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to talk to you folks here
 
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
today is given what's going on at the
 
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
federal level and the fact that we don't
 
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
know where the dust is going to settle
 
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
on the federal law with what CMS is
 
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
going to come out with for guidelines
 
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
what we should do with House Bill 587 we
 
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
have three options before us one
 
00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 align:start position:0%
because again these are all
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations back to the full
 
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
committee we don't decide here we only
 
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
can make our recommendation back to our
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
we're option one we can have IPL as a
 
00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.130 align:start position:0%
we're option one we can have IPL as a
recommendation

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
option two ought to pass and option
 
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
internet study basically means that over
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
the summer time
 
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 align:start position:0%
we'll have another committee meeting
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
talking about House Bill 587
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
but what we should do going forward for
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
the next legislative body we can't bind
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
that body we can make a recommendation
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
to the body about whether we want future
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
legislation or not
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
so those are the three options we have
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
on the table before us today
 
00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm study
 
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass or in a study
 
00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 align:start position:0%
so I'll open up my colleagues around the
 
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
table what your thoughts are as far as a
 
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation of those three
 
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
and why you'd want to support that
 
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.610 align:start position:0%
and why you'd want to support that
recommendation

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.930 align:start position:0%
 
all right

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.190 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
so before the federal law changed
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
I went and reviewed the testimony from
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
last winter
 
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
and the testimony was pretty
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly opposed to this bill for
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
a variety of reasons one of which was I
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of our transplants if they
 
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
don't happen to Dartmouth they're going
 
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
to be in Boston and do we really want to
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
get Massachusetts all upset and have
 
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
them write a law which then makes it
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
harder for New Hampshire residents
 
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.749 align:start position:0%
harder for New Hampshire residents
potentially

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
um that was one of the arguments the the
 
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
um I think the other one was that there
 
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
were legal questions about whether this
 
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
would be lawful at all
 
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
and then with the change in the federal
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
law I'm going well we don't even know
 
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
what what's going to happen now and it
 
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
seems that um
 
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
that that at this point we should just
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
totally pause on this so
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
um either itl or interim study
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll come back to the inner study I
 
00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 align:start position:0%
mean my my personal feeling would be itl
 
00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
and then if the if down the road when
 
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
the federal laws settled people want to
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
bring something back they can
 
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.430 align:start position:0%
bring something back they can
um

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
the other the question about interrupt
 
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
study is if we do that that would just
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
apply to next year
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
and so I wonder if the federal if if the
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
federal rules will even be
 
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
um out to to make an interim study
 
00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 align:start position:0%
useful again in a study to be clear on
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
the terminology
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
in the study basically means that we
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
would go recommendation to our committee
 
00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
then if it goes through the house that
 
00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:41.749 align:start position:0%
then if it goes through the house that
way

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
then it'll be another committee that
 
00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 align:start position:0%
would talk about what to do as next
 
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
steps and that would be whether to
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
bring forward legislation or not bring
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
forward legislation that's basically the
 
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
only thing that can be done at that
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
point in time to bring forward
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
legislation requires another
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
member legislative body in the
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
subsequent session or term to bring
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
forth that legislation we can't bring it
 
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:15.529 align:start position:0%
forth that legislation we can't bring it
forth

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
my first inclination would be a
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
to recommend committee or to pass and
 
00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 align:start position:0%
let the whole house debate it because
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
since we worked on this bill in the
 
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.450 align:start position:0%
since we worked on this bill in the
spring

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 align:start position:0%
spring
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
from testimonies it looked like
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
everything is fine but apparently you
 
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 align:start position:0%
know and some other
 
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 align:start position:0%
Federal systems that were managing uh
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
this organ procurement and distribution
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
had some major problems said this bill
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
can at least partially
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
address so I think
 
00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:04.819 align:start position:0%
the data which we saw
 
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
this summer actually shows that
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
there is some
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
some actual problems that this bills
 
00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:22.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative Regis
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
did you want to add any comments to this
 
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.230 align:start position:0%
did you want to add any comments to this
conversation

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
I do understand that representative
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
McDonald will be here in about five
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
minutes so we can take a slight pause
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
until he gets here
 
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.870 align:start position:0%
until he gets here
um

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:00.979 align:start position:0%
blows up pelosia
 
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
say your last name again for me pull
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay president Pelosi recommendation is
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
to octopass
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
okay yes and representative Palmer your
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in the audience that
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
wants to address the committee
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is John
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick I'm Chief public affairs
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
officer at New England donor Services
 
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
New England donor Services is the organ
 
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
procurement organization designated by
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
the federal government to recover organs
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
and tissues in the six New England
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
states so as such we recover organs and
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
have and work with around 200 different
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New England
 
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
we understand the purpose from speaking
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
to the representative cambrells who
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
wrote the the legislation was his
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
concern that allocation changes in 2021
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
would negatively impact New Hampshire
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
patients and in an attempt to get in
 
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.060 align:start position:0%
front of that issue he wanted to keep
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire organs close to home our
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
view is when you look at the data that
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
the system of allocating organs based on
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
how long someone's been waiting how sick
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
they are and how close they are to the
 
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
donor is a significantly better way of
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
allocating organs than had been done
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
previously which were based not on a 250
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
mile concentric circle around the donor
 
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
but based on
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
um archaic lines drawn by bureaucrats in
 
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:08.459 align:start position:0%
Washington DC so our view is it
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be state by state it should be
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
patient by patient we should have a
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
patient-centric view of this how long
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
has the patient been waiting how sick is
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
the patient how close is the patient to
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
the donor those are the major factors
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
and not whether or not somebody is a
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
resident of this state or that state and
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned this would particularly
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
hurt New Hampshire patients who the
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
major majority of whom get transplanted
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
out of state there are kidney patients
 
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:37.580 align:start position:0%
who get transplanted out of state
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
including and then also every heart
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
liver and lung patient has to be
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
transplanted out of state because New
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because Dartmouth doesn't do
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
those transplants
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
to set up a system where it's state by
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
state and transplants say that take
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
place in Massachusetts go first to
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts residents would really
 
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
hurt the entire New England area and so
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
I think that our view would be the
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
current allocation system works for the
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
patients of New Hampshire and that the
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
data proves that and then secondarily
 
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
there is the issue of federal preemption
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
we are a federally designated organ
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
procurement organization Dartmouth is a
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
federally recognized transplant center
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
neither of us can do anything that is
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
off the list that is the federal
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
optn runs a computer algorithm that
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
tells us who the next patient is based
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
on things like time waiting and sickness
 
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:46.220 align:start position:0%
and body size we must abide by the list
 
00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
and the transplant center has to abide
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
by the list so even if this did pass
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that probably wouldn't be any changes in
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because it would be
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:04.100 align:start position:0%
the thing that
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
would you mind taking a second to help
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
this committee understand the
 
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.910 align:start position:0%
this committee understand the
subcommittee

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:13.820 align:start position:0%
the new federal law that was passed the
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
securing the U.S U.S organ procurement
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
and transportation Network act how is
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
that going to change things from your
 
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:24.500 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's been one organization called the
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
United Network for organ sharing that
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
has held the contract for a long time
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
the federal government is thinking that
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
it is very hard for other contractors to
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
apply for that contract because eunos
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
does so much at such a high level that
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
really nobody has the expertise to come
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
in and do exactly what they do what the
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
federal government is thinking is
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
cutting up the duties of Unos into say
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
five different contracts maybe a
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
transportation contract maybe a I.T
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
contract a policy and development
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
contract in that way maybe an IBM could
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
bid for just the I.T section of the
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
contract and allow say you knows to
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
continue with the policy uh contract so
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's that the most important thing
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
they're doing is uh breaking up the
 
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
contract and then number two putting
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
significantly more money into the system
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
I think eunos is operating off of seven
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year and this new
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
contractual system is going to be
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
spending upwards of 70 million so about
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
10 times more money is being put into
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
the system to run it at the national
 
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.930 align:start position:0%
the system to run it at the national
level

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
um but so there are there are likely to
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
be as we come along uh some uh changes
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
in the way policy is developed and there
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
might be some policy changes I think the
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
big issue going forward now what you'll
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
see with allocation is the 250 mile
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
limit around the donor was is was a stop
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
Gap because when you think of it 250
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
miles is pretty arbitrary as well what
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
if there's someone really really sick at
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
251 miles so
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
um redoing the computer coding so it
 
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
puts more emphasis on how close you are
 
00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
to the donor and how sick you are and
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
kind of leaving off the 250 mile
 
00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:30.110 align:start position:0%
kind of leaving off the 250 mile
line

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so that will probably be developed
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
for kidneys probably in the next 18
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
members of the committee any additional
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
questions to the uh
 
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
the person doing the presentation right
 
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:53.530 align:start position:0%
the person doing the presentation right
now

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:53.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
I see a represented out in the audience
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
okay just want to be sure there's also
 
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
some members I think maybe the public
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
would you like to make any comments
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald any thoughts
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
about what you would like to see this
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
committee do
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
well it was first of all my apologies
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
for being late I was
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
detained but
 
00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:29.410 align:start position:0%
detained but
um

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:29.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
I appreciate Mr chairman the emails that
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
have been sent out and have been making
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
their ways around
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
um and um if this was covered earlier I
 
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.350 align:start position:0%
um and um if this was covered earlier I
apologize

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
um for not being here uh the email that
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
came out about legislation that
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
President Biden has signed how does that
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
impact this does it make it move or
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
that's the question before us okay all
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
right so that is not resolved yet
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
no I think the question that I see
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
before this subcommittee of our
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
committee is to make a recommendation
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
back to the full committee and my
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
understanding is we have three
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we could make one
 
00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.710 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we could make one
IPL

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
IPL
 
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.210 align:start position:0%
IPL
to

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
OTP or three interim study
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
so I guess at this point in time
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
hopefully today we can come up with this
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with some recommendation
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
back to our full committee okay
 
00:16:26.339 --> 00:16:27.470 align:start position:0%
back to our full committee okay
sure

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
a question to chair uh is there another
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
option to
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
try to come
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to make some Amendment to
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
yes you are
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
so if you desire to bring
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
fourth in amendment when we get into
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
exactly session I will now refer to our
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
church here I believe at that point in
 
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
time in exactly the session you can
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment to the online bill
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
and then the committee will communicate
 
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment and that Amendment
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
if it passes would then go into an auto
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
pass as a minute
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
and that's after this goes back to the
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
full HHS committee right we could
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
so actually it's four options because we
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
could do OTP
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
and to represent Yuri's
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
um comment we can also do an otpa a
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
that we could support the aligned Bill
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
my my thoughts on this is the fact that
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
we do have Federal preemption
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
and I think at this point in time not
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly what the federal
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
government's going to do and how they're
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
going to make
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
changes on the underlying
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
process if you will
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
um whether it's going to be multiple
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
contracts funneled through one agency it
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
was going to be multiple agencies I
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't really know that's been clear
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
I think the intent is to have one policy
 
00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:20.059 align:start position:0%
National policy with different
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
contractors working under the same
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
policy but it's not clear in a federal
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that that is a mandate it
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
could be something which CMS is going to
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
work on and how they're going to work on
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I think at this point
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
in time given the unknown of what's
 
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
happening at the federal level and the
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
fact that we have Federal preemption
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'm leaning towards more to itl it
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
possibly to consider income study so
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
maybe by next summer we'll have more
 
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
indication from the federal guidelines
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
coming from CMS what their intent is but
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
right now I think to act on something at
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
another another concern that's been
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
expressed is New Hampshire is a very
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
small state and if we start being
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
possessive of
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh who you know protecting our own
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
organs father States follow suit we
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
could we could be negatively impacted by
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
that if a library state were to follow
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
in that kind of policy that's been
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh take a question on
 
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.830 align:start position:0%
uh take a question on
so

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
what are the benefits
 
00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.029 align:start position:0%
what are the benefits
of

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
um for the we will continue to work on
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
this bill or
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
if we continue to work on this bill can
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
it be introduced again in the next
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
session or
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
like if we kill it now like Israel like
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
um this is my take on it but I will
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
definitely defer to uh chairman McDonald
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
about the actual ins and outs of this if
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
it goes to interim study
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
then you'll have another bite at the
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
Apple with another group of our peers
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it comes from all of our
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
community members or become some people
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
within the house at that point in time
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
they would work on exactly what we're
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
doing now have earrings
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
discuss it and then next fall at the
 
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
election cycle bring forth future
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation based upon the information
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
that they obtained during the interim
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
answer your question is you can't really
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
bring it forth in January but you could
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity during the summer
 
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.510 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity during the summer
time

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
to have more discussion bring together
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and based upon the
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
conversation with the very stakeholders
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
is in subsequent year which would be in
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
2025 24. he could then bring forth
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
yeah if we were to itl and in the house
 
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
followed our recommendation in January
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
the bill can't be brought back in the
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
second year of the session the same bill
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
can't be brought back so it would have
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
to either be a Senate bill
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
um or is to the chairman Merchant's
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
point it would have to wait until 2025
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
in some form you know interim study
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
bills also basically the ultimate
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
decision is to either recommend and not
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
where's the pelosa are you looking at
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
trying to bring something forward in the
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
subsequent legislative body versus next
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislative year
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
because if we're looking to do something
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
going forward instead of just doing itl
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
maybe the option would be an interim
 
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.090 align:start position:0%
maybe the option would be an interim
study

00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time pulled
 
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059 align:start position:0%
together stakeholders with the various
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholder communities
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could be the chair
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time through those
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
discussions come up with a
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation back to the Full House
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
basically saying either future
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
legislation or no future legislation but
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
that may be if you're really interested
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
in trying to do something a better
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
um one thought I have is where the it
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
kind of It kind of comes down to a legal
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
question based on the federal law that
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
was just signed is that something the
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
legal council of the house could help
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
advise us on perhaps
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good point so how do we do that
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
either myself or you could approach him
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
attorney ciancie and see if he could run
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
to some kind of an opinion for this
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to either consider or or at
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
least that's uh you know I don't know if
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
you're planning to have another meeting
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
or not but uh well we have another
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
meeting or we just consider it you know
 
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
via email among the four of us and bring
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to the um the full HHS
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
committee based on attorney C ansi's
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
input that would be a consideration
 
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.770 align:start position:0%
input that would be a consideration
perhaps

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want me to do that
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
or if you want to do that or
 
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.690 align:start position:0%
or if you want to do that or
um

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
if you would be so kind to your past
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
could be fine I think what I'm hearing
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
is that we're looking at preemption
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
based upon the underlying bill which is
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
587. where they would stand or we're
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
looking at something going forward and
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
saying based upon what's happening at
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
the federal level at the state level do
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
we have any wiggle room or is federal
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
preemption going to basically shut down
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
anything we want to do at the state
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
level right and you know I I can't speak
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
obviously for attorney ciancie he may
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
not feel comfortable rendering that kind
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
of judgment but we can you know I'd be
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
willing to ask him to
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
if you feel that's appropriate yes I do
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
a procedure question
 
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.149 align:start position:0%
a procedure question
um if

00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald is going to cast that
 
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
question it's does it
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to matter what we do to even
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
if we itl it that's sort of a then it
 
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
becomes a moot point
 
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.350 align:start position:0%
becomes a moot point
right

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so and if so I guess
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
so where I'm stuck is I I really would
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
be not willing to to vote
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
ought to pass for this but if voting
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
interim study gives gives us time to
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
find out whether it's legal or not then
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
um menu is a really good point
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
again what we do today today is I'll do
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
a recommendation back to the full
 
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.190 align:start position:0%
a recommendation back to the full
committee

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
so we could as a committee come up with
 
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
a recommendation
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
whatever that recommendation is
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
and then once we find out what's coming
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
on with a legal opinion bring that legal
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
support our initial recommendation or
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
change our recommendation at the time of
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
Mr perhaps
 
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.610 align:start position:0%
Mr perhaps
um

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
and that's my understanding the
 
00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:30.419 align:start position:0%
subcommittee everything we do has to be
 
00:25:30.419 --> 00:25:31.330 align:start position:0%
subcommittee everything we do has to be
public

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:31.340 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:33.500 align:start position:0%
as it is today
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could have a a quick
 
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting even
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
the morning of the full you know the
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
full committee meeting uh which will be
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
probably late October or early November
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
the deadline for retained bills is
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
November 17th
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could have a quick one just
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
based on attorney C hansi's opinion and
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know make our official
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
recommendation at that time if that
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
sounds good
 
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.190 align:start position:0%
sounds good
yeah

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time we're going to
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
not come up with a recommendation we're
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
gonna have a subsequent meeting before
 
00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
our next full committee meeting which we
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
Legislative Assistant how do I fill out
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
this form that's before me because we're
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
not making really a recommendation we're
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
going to postpone things until then
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
so is there anything else we would like
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
to talk about today or should we make a
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
motion to adjourn
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
for that recommendation to meet prior to
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
the full committee meeting in October
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
November at the college share
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
that's fine I I know of no other
 
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
business to come before us unless the
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
other members have something
 
00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:24.169 align:start position:0%
other members have something
no

00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
oh thank you well I joined the meeting
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
and we'll reconvene at the
 
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
prior to the next meeting at the college
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
share about 15-20 minutes before that so
