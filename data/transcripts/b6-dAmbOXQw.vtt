Senate Bill 128 and in particular the
 
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment
 
00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:30.550 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment
um

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
2023 1482 which I sponsored and I I
 
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
guess I should say
 
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.610 align:start position:0%
guess I should say
um

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.749 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
the non-germane
 
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
non-germannness of this amendment
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
pertains only to section two of the bill
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
which is what the section that proposes
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
to add a new
 
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.370 align:start position:0%
to add a new
uh

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
that is the is the new uh Amendment
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I should
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
I should note that um
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
an alternative to my amendment that
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
um has been uh proposed by
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith which
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
is the same as my Amendment except that
 
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.730 align:start position:0%
section two
um

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
and as I've said to her and I really say
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
to to the other members of the of the
 
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
committee and also to the public I
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
I don't really think I have any problem
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that there's a that
 
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
there that people feel that we shouldn't
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
go ahead and go forward with section two
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
um but only section one I I very likely
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
would be willing to withdraw my
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
amendment in favor of Representative
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
Smith's Amendment but nonetheless since
 
00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 align:start position:0%
we scheduled a hearing on it and since I
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
do I actually do think and I'll tell you
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
in a minute why since section two has
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
some value
 
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I I would at least like to explore
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
um going forward with with Maya men
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Smith
 
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:21.539 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair let me just respond to what
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
you said before we go on because I think
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's relevant
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
um if if you were not on this committee
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
and your understanding of what this
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
committee is to do this morning was
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
based on the official House calendar
 
00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:44.899 align:start position:0%
that came out Thursday night
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
it says relative to payment for legal
 
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
services for persons involuntarily
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
admitted for mental health services the
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
amendment establishes the payment of
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
legal services for Indigent and
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
non-indigent individuals involuntarily
 
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
committed for mental health services as
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
well as the process to determine such
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
indigency and repayment for such
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
Services that's what it says so no one
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
except those people in the know
 
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
would have any idea
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
about part two of the amendment because
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
the the calendar does not even
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it so to begin with I have
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
problems that way with house bill with
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
with your amendment I do want to say
 
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
that although I have notified the
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
committee of the possibility of my
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
um introducing an amendment out of
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
courtesy and we haven't discussed it at
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
all certainly because of 91a
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
I personally don't like my amendment I
 
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
think for
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons
 
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
not good I would prefer to go with just
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
the bill but out of respect for the
 
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee and out of my
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
commitment always to try to find
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
compromise I do have that amendment that
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
I haven't yet distributed
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
um seen how the committee feels that
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
might I would then bring it forward as
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
an alternative so um I you know I thank
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
you for
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
um beginning the way you did which made
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
it possible for us to kind of get a
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
sense of the lay of the land sure sure
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
no no that's fine and I guess you know I
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would say is um on the on
 
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
the notice I mean I I don't I don't
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
particularly disagree with with the the
 
00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:44.339 align:start position:0%
fact that the notice probably could have
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
been better than it was uh but on the
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
other hand it does refer to the
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
amendment and so somebody in the
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
somebody that was was interested in this
 
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:53.459 align:start position:0%
and wanted to pick up the amendment
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
could have picked up the amendment and
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
read it and would would be informed so
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
um anyway I guess I would what I would
 
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.490 align:start position:0%
um anyway I guess I would what I would
say

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
um with with regard to this is with
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
regard to section two and I'm glad that
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
um uh judge king is here from the uh
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
from the circuit court because I think
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
he can uh he may be able to uh confirm
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
my recollection of this but
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things and also uh uh uh the
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative from the judicial Council
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I can remember
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
over a number of years being involved in
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
the court system is there were a number
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
of occasions on which
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
there would a question would come up
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
as to paying for counsel or for other
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
services ins in one context or another
 
00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
services ins in one context or another
and

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
as as some of you may or may not have
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
some of you may not be aware but there's
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
a statute it's RSA
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
490 31.
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
which basically says if a question if
 
00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
if if the court uh directs that some
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
services including legal service
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
Services be provided and it's unclear
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
who pays the court pays and so
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
um uh that means that the the monies
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
come out of the Court's budget as
 
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
opposed to the judicial council's budget
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
or some some other uh entity DHHS or
 
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
whatever budget
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
um and that was often a source of a fair
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
amount of frustration in the court
 
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
saying why you know this really ought to
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
be this really ought to come out of the
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
judicial Council budget so the purpose
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
of section two
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
was essentially to create
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
a a catch-all
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
provision that says
 
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.910 align:start position:0%
provision that says
if

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
if there's any circumstance in which
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
either the Constitution or a state
 
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.829 align:start position:0%
either the Constitution or a state
statute

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
grants a right to council to an
 
00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.150 align:start position:0%
grants a right to council to an
individual

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
um who uh and provides that the person
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
has a right to uh that if Indigent the
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
person has a right to appointed counsel
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and then then Council would be paid
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
in those circumstances from the judicial
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
Council and there would be and that
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
would be subject to reimbursement in the
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
same way that uh reimbursement is is uh
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
allowed under 604a for Council in uh in
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
juvenile cases or criminal cases that
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I just thought that that
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
made that was a good housekeeping
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment so to speak that
 
00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
um that uh basically
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
consolidates if you will that all uh
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
payments for Council and related
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
services in these kinds of cases is to
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
be paid
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
um out of uh funds for the judicial
 
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.569 align:start position:0%
um out of uh funds for the judicial
Council

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
Council
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would note because I'm sure
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
Mr sample will have has very legitimate
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
concerns on this that there are
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
obviously there are some financial
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
implications for the judicial Council
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
about that and I would note in that
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
regard that this bill is is on a fast
 
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
track because the next place it goes if
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
it passes is to finance
 
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
it passes is to finance
um where

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
um where
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
um presumably they can deal with those
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh with those issues I'm certainly
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to uh to uh
 
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
Mr samples uh
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
what I anticipate would be his concerns
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
on this so that's uh with that I guess I
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
will uh
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
open the hearing and I would uh first
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
policy director at the disability rights
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
Center and I'm here to strongly
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
encourage you to oppose the non-germaine
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment and to recommend
 
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
autopass as amended by the Senate on SB
 
00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
128. and the reason for this is that
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about right to
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
counsel and these kinds of circumstances
 
00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
when someone's subjected to an iea it's
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
much different from a criminal
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
proceeding where there's a right to
 
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:21.650 align:start position:0%
proceeding where there's a right to
counsel

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
VES instead of using initials could you
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry an involuntary emergency
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
admission or an emergency or an
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
involuntary admission to a hospital what
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here are people who
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
have a really profound and serious
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
underlying mental illness who are in
 
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.290 align:start position:0%
underlying mental illness who are in
crisis

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
and as a result of this underlying
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
mental illness and crisis that they are
 
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
in they are believed to be a danger to
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
themselves most frequently or perhaps
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
other people but most frequently what we
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
hear is that it's someone who's actively
 
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.550 align:start position:0%
hear is that it's someone who's actively
suicidal

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
suicidal
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
they're brought in by police treated as
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
criminals even though they're not
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
criminals this is non-volitional this is
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
something that occurs because of an
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
underlying mental illness they're
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
brought into an emergency room where
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
they are warehoused there's a
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
determination made by a doctor that this
 
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
should move forward so that they are
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
held there
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
Liberty removed for three days it's
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
usually around three days they have to
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
have a hearing before a court at that
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
point and then a judge would make a
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
decision about whether there's probable
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
cause to involuntarily admit them to the
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
mental health system
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
and in this process because we are
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
removing someone's Liberty our law
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
provides for the appointment of counsel
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's an absolute right and it also
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
makes it really difficult to waive
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
counsel which is not exactly like a
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding either so what the
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
current law says is that a court would
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
have to make a finding that someone made
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
an informed decision if they were going
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
to waive Council so we've got person
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
mentally serious mental illness
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
is dangerous mostly to themselves
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's not volitional you know we don't
 
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
have charges here pending criminal
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
charges they are appointed an attorney
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
because they have in fact lost their
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
Liberty they're being warehoused in a
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
hospital for a while
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and it most of the time at least in
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
our offices experience these people are
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
very poor because if they had means and
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
had Private health insurance
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
they would likely be receiving the
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment that they
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
require in the community but because as
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
you all are probably painfully aware
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
we don't have a robust community-based
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
mental health system we don't even have
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
enough voluntary beds if someone needs a
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
hospitalization temporarily so people
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
reach the crisis Point attorneys are
 
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.409 align:start position:0%
reach the crisis Point attorneys are
appointed

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
now we're going to start chasing them
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
for fees that's what this does
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
the current law provides the people who
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
have the means to pay are supposed to
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
pay for those fees as a practical matter
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
they are not pursued and I think what
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
the amendment the bill is amended by the
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
Senate does is it really recognizes the
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
reality that we're talking about a
 
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
population that's getting essentially
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
fined for having a mental illness and we
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
don't want it and that's not right
 
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.070 align:start position:0%
don't want it and that's not right
so

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
for for those reasons I would urge you
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
to reject the non-germain amendment and
 
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
just let the bill pass as the senate had
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
amended it and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
you next I'm going to call on Maggie
 
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:38.090 align:start position:0%
you next I'm going to call on Maggie
Pritchard

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for having me
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
um my name is Maggie Pritchard I'm the
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
president of the Behavioral Health
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
Association in New Hampshire for all the
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers who
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
executive directors read this
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
legislation Amendment and said oh my God
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
we can't support this and I said let me
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
go I really want to talk to people and I
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
really want to explain what it's like
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
because I am that person who has
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
assessed someone and I don't know how
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
many of you have had the privilege of
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
being with someone who is very
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and very sick and their
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
illness has taken over for them and
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
perhaps they are going to go to another
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
place right and you feel so privileged
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
to be with them as a mental health
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
clinician who has been with someone who
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
is acutely ill and saying to them I'm
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
terribly sorry I have to take away your
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
civil rights because your illness has
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
taken over right now and you can't have
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
a choice the choice now is in in someone
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
else's hands you have to go to the
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
hospital I know you don't want to go to
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
the hospital that's why I have to fill
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
out this form with this physician and
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
take away your rights I don't think that
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody is physically ill mentally
 
00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
ill we should be imposing charges for
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
legal fees on them they couldn't make a
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
decision to say yes I'd like to have a
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer or no I wouldn't like to have a
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer because in the state that they're
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
in they are so vulnerable that I and our
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
physician have had to take away their
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
rights so I implore you to think kindly
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
about this and think about what it does
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
to human beings who suffer with major
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
illnesses and say no this amendment
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
can't fly thank you question of ask
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.549 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
representative

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
taking my my question Miss Pritchard so
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
I just have a question so you're
 
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
mentioning not charging somebody when
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're in a mental health crisis which
 
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
I can completely sympathize with I'm
 
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
I can completely sympathize with I'm
wondering

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
your facility or your practice when
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
somebody's in some type of a mental
 
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:49.460 align:start position:0%
health crisis mode do you typically
 
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.190 align:start position:0%
health crisis mode do you typically
provide

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
free care to them yes well I work at a
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
mental health center so we are
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
contracted by the state and we take all
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
comers regardless of ability to pay and
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
particularly when people are in crisis
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
may I follow up yes please so if
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
somebody is able to pay would would you
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
guys pursue having them pay or if when
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
they're in Mental Health crisis mode
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
they automatically just don't have to
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
pay regardless of ability it's always on
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
ability to pay so if you have private
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
insurance we'll bill your insurance if
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
you don't have insurance will reduce
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
your fee to nothing if that's what you
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
need but we don't
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
put extra charges on you so to speak for
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
having your illness we don't you know it
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness

of public policy for Nami New Hampshire
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%

00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
organization whose mission is to improve
 
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire on behalf of Nami New
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today to speak in
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
opposition to the amendment that's being
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
considered and I did just want to answer
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
the question that was just asked for
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis services in our state from
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
speaking to people in the state it's my
 
00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:40.190 align:start position:0%
speaking to people in the state it's my
understanding

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
that while they may Bill private
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
insurance anything that the private
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
insurance does not pay is paid for by
 
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
the state so there is no out-of-pocket
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
cost for those crisis Services they do
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
build the insurer because the insurer
 
00:22:57.649 --> 00:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
you have a contractual arrangement with
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
the insurer and they have the obligation
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
to pay for those Services because they
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
are contracted services but there is no
 
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket cost to the individual for
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
those crisis services
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
um you've heard um I don't want to
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
repeat anything you've already heard
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
from Miss Rosenberg or from
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
from uh from Maggie so but I do want to
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
point out that you know since this is an
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
involuntary commitment the person is not
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
seeking treatment they don't even want
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
these services and many times they're
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
not even aware as you've heard of the
 
00:23:35.409 --> 00:23:35.419 align:start position:0%
circumstances surrounding their illness
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
to be held against their will and then
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
hit with legal fees once they're stable
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
and released from the hospital
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
regardless of their ability to pay does
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
not seem appropriate
 
00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.289 align:start position:0%
not seem appropriate
um

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:51.260 align:start position:0%
during you know when they're being seen
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a time to hand somebody a
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit and say can you
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
please fill this out and that's what the
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
court would need to do and prior to
 
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
getting into policy I did debt
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
collection for five years
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
I remember sitting down face to face
 
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
because the court depended on the
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorneys to work with the
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
defendants on payment arrangements for
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
small claims cases that was the majority
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
of what I did I had to help people fill
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
out those financial affidavits
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
they were not in a mental health crisis
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
and still could not fill them out so
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
you know the court would not have the
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
information in order to be able to make
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
a determination on the ability to pay
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
and they also wouldn't have the
 
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
documents signed under
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
um the Pains of penalties of perjury
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
which is also necessary for the court to
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
make a determination so I would you know
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
just say that it's nearly impossible for
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
the courts to even try to make this
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
determination when the person is in
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
front of them for the very short time
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
that they're that they are in front of
 
00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
them and I know that judge king is here
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
today and I'm sure he'd be happy to let
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
you folks know what the process looks
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
like on his end if you'd like to hear
 
00:25:05.169 --> 00:25:05.179 align:start position:0%
from him
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
currently the court is paying a hundred
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
dollars for that initial three-day
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
um probable cause hearing and sixty five
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
dollars for the second one
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost the office of Cost
 
00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299 align:start position:0%
Containment a heck of a lot more than
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
165 dollars to collect 165 dollars and
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that's a good use of
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
the state's money
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
um you know you've heard that the mental
 
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:34.220 align:start position:0%
health system as we have it today
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of work done in the
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan so
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for all the work
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's been done on that but a lot more
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done in order for folks
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
to have services so that money could be
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
spent and investing in services that if
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
people had those services on the front
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
end there's a good chance they wouldn't
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
end up in the emergency room in the
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the information being
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to obtain fairness is a factor
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
in these situations the only thing that
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
people on an iea the involuntary
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
emergency admission are guilty of is
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
having a mental illness you've heard
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
that so we're essentially charging
 
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.649 align:start position:0%
that so we're essentially charging
people

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
because they're sick because they have
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
symptoms that are beyond their control
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
this is the only illness
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
that the state has determined if your
 
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.529 align:start position:0%
that the state has determined if your
symptoms

00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
are really bad
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
that you will you can potentially you
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
lose your Liberty it's the only one
 
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.070 align:start position:0%
lose your Liberty it's the only one
um

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
cancer patients people with diabetes
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
they can all refuse treatment for
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
medical services and that's okay even if
 
00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
it's going to kill them
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
you can't do that with mental health so
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
these folks are basically being charged
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
because they have a mental illness
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
and as you've heard waving council is
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible for these folks so
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
they don't even have a choice about
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
whether they have counsel or not and
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
then they're forced to pay for it
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
I also provided you this is testimony
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
that one of our members
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
provided to Senate finance and I just
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you guys a flavor of what
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's like to have somebody a loved one
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room I will not read it
 
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
to you you have it in front of you so
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
that you can read it yourself but I do
 
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read through the first
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
couple paragraphs of that before you
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
make any decisions on this amendment
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
today because it's it's painful it's
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
traumatic for the person going through
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
it it's traumatic for the family and
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
then to be sent Financial affidavits and
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
and bills for legal fees on top of it
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
can can also be traumatic for these
 
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.250 align:start position:0%
can can also be traumatic for these
folks

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
so with that I will just end and I will
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
has questions for this witness yes
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate it as a visitor you
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
allowing me to ask a question but I just
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm I'm properly
 
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
oriented on what our issue is here uh
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
you miss Stevens you've you've said that
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
this is the only thing for which an
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
individual may be charged that they then
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
become and then they become responsible
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
for the legal bill
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
I think aren't we talking about an
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
involuntary commitment because the
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
person is perceived to be a danger to
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
themselves or to others so this so that
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
the use of the word charge is that
 
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
really appropriate in this circumstance
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
when this is a medical intervention
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's intended to protect the
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
individual safety or the public safety
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
when I said charge I don't mean charges
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
in a crime has been charged I mean as in
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
money is being charged thank you for the
 
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.810 align:start position:0%
money is being charged thank you for the
clarification

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:49.700 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.490 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
sorry

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:51.500 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative germanna I'm sorry no
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I appreciate I'm
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
also subbing today so I appreciate the
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask a question and and
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
you alluded to this at the end of your
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
testimony you know is it safe to say
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
that an individual who is experiencing a
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis and then and
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
receives these services
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
if they are then you know billed
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
afterwards in their attempts to follow
 
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
up and they don't have the means to pay
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
isn't it safe to say that this is adding
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
additional stressors which actually
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
undermines their ability to recover uh
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
adequately so we're we're making it
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
worse for that individual uh and and
 
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
their ability to to recover by pursuing
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
them for money that they can't pay it
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely is and just to give an
 
00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:37.789 align:start position:0%
absolutely is and just to give an
example

00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
um there's a a family member of One of
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire's members who went
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
under stress they light themselves on
 
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.210 align:start position:0%
under stress they light themselves on
fire

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
fire
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
and their family has said if they were
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
to receive a bill and or a financial
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
affidavit it would be very very
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to deal with that and
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
they could end up trying to light
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
themselves on fire and end up back in
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
the ER on another involuntary admission
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
and then the cycle just starts all over
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
again so yes this can be extremely
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
stressful for them more stressful than
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
you or I who you know have a job and pay
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
bills every single day
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair yes
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
um taking my question and I'm not sure
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
if you're the right person but what is
 
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
the threshold for the um indigency what
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
I mean what are we looking at are we
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
um their income and does that include
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
public benefits what if they have a
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
house but no income or if they've saved
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
for renting I mean how does how do we
 
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
for renting I mean how does how do we
determine

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
um who's Indigent how do the judge
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
determine that that I don't know I think
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
that would be a best answered by
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
somebody from the court than by me I'm
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
not sure what they look at when they're
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
looking at and didn't see whether they
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
look at assets or not
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%

my name is Richard Sam Peril I'm the
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
acting executive director of the New
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
I know from the days when I served in
 
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council because I was chair
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
of this committee about the constant
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
Financial pressures
 
00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:08.179 align:start position:0%
that that you are under in there and
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
fortunately our system makes it possible
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
for the judicial Council to go to the
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to ask for additional
 
00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:17.990 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to ask for additional
money

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
so in that context
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
are there financial implications about
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
this amendment that would affect the
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
work of the judicial Council so at the
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
last hearing thank you for the question
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
representative the last hearing on this
 
00:32:38.049 --> 00:32:38.059 align:start position:0%
bill I
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
testified about the
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
the substantive part of the bill and the
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
financial implications for the judicial
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
Council there in terms of the amendment
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's proposed I'll confess I'm a
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
little confused about the mechanics of
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
how it would be done in terms of
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
assessing uh when a person is eligible
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
to pay and then
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
um the follow-up on that and certainly
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
that would be the office of Cost
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
Containment that would be responsible
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
for that collection I guess I
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
um do think in terms of financial
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
implications for the judicial Council
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
that the collection process itself may
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
involve further hearings where maybe
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
Council was appointed and it it seems
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
like maybe there may be a situation
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
where we're now paying Council to
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
collect money for Council but the
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
overall uh concerns here are with
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
respect to the
 
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.350 align:start position:0%
respect to the
um

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
payment for these Services out of the
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
judicial council's budget without that
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
appropriation having been included in
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
the the bill in total and uh the
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
specific amendment in terms of the
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
collection determination I just don't
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh understand necessarily how that may
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
affect judicial council's uh payments
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
because I'm not clear when that process
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
would take place it clearly wouldn't be
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
at the time of the finding that a person
 
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
would be involuntarily admitted if if
 
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
they were in fact admitted that means
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
they're not at a position to make that
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
Financial commitment or determination of
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I'm not entirely clear
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
on how the process would play out thank
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
you could I follow up yes
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.730 align:start position:0%
um thank you
um

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
can you describe for us your the
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
judicial council's relationship to the
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
um sure so the office of Cost
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
Containment is part of the Department of
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
administrative Services which is a
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
different state agency it is not part of
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council the office of Cost
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
Containment is responsible for the
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
collection of monies
 
00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:08.099 align:start position:0%
those monies don't necessarily get
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
transferred to the judicial Council so
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
while the office of Cost Containment is
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
collecting that doesn't necessarily
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
translate to uh revenue for my agency
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
and I certainly don't oversee the folks
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
who work in that office so I don't have
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
any direct supervision authority over
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
those people that could if I could just
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
ask one more and you might not know the
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
answer to this
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
um do you have
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with any reports
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
from the office of Cost Containment as
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
they have been able to collect
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
each year and the cost to the state
 
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
for their efforts to collect
 
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.050 align:start position:0%
for their efforts to collect
um

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
so I have been in this position uh since
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
December I am aware that
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
in the context of indigent criminal
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
cases that the that there have been some
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh I think reports on the topic you're
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
asking about I don't off the top of my
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
head know what the response is or what
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
those reports stayed but I I can just
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
tell you anecdotally and generally that
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
I think the efforts at collection have
 
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.230 align:start position:0%
I think the efforts at collection have
been

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:39.260 align:start position:0%
um less than successful historically
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
um it just as an aside to the chair
 
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.069 align:start position:0%
um it just as an aside to the chair
um

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
you know in-service training is always
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
helpful for all of us and at some point
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
you might want to ask
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
um someone from the office of Costco I
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
mean or the commissioner to come and
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
explain how that all works because it's
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
important based on the issues that have
 
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
been raised by the committee well I
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
would say I did have a I actually did
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
have a discussion with commissioner
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
Ireland house about this
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
um and I will talk about that when we
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
get to the our executive session uh
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Beth you have a question
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
I do thank you
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question I'm
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bills that came
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and the financial
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
note on it
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and when you mention the cost the
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
transfer of cost of responsibility of
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
collecting these bills is that the one
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
million five hundred thousand dollars at
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
your time so it's an unfunded mandate if
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
you will that you'll be collecting so
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
um the cost is
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
um unclear in the sense that uh my
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
calculations that are in the fiscal note
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
on the bill are based upon the court
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
rules that allocate the the fees in
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
these types of cases in addition to my
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
calculations there are there was some
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
information provided by Health and Human
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
Services about what they used to pay in
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
these kinds of cases when they were
 
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.370 align:start position:0%
these kinds of cases when they were
responsible

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then there was also testimony by uh
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
Attorney Richard head who was at the
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch at that time and
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
um indicating the cost that they are the
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
the courts are currently paying in these
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
types of cases uh which is a flat
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar fee in the main hearing
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
and then as was testified about I think
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's a follow-up fee of 65 so so in
 
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
terms of the budgeting for my agency If
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
This Were to be enacted my calculations
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
are based upon the the cost under the
 
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
rule but my expectation is that uh at
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
least based upon what the current
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
contract is with the judicial branch
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
that it's about a hundred dollars a
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
hearing for for these types of types of
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
hearings and I I think probably uh judge
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
king is probably better equipped to
 
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
answer the actual cost per hearing but
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry this is a circuitous way
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
of answering your question which was yes
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's what we calculate the cost may be
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
somebody follow up yes thank you so
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
um the bill says it goes into effect if
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
it passes in 60 days so how will your
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
agency of the county how does it take
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
people off to do what's going to be the
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
impact of of the passage of this yes so
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question at the last
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
hearing uh representative Smith
 
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
um asked me some other questions about
 
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.790 align:start position:0%
um asked me some other questions about
that

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I think 60 days is a
 
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.950 align:start position:0%
um I think 60 days is a
um

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
you know a very tight time frame I don't
 
00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where that money
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
specifically comes from other than it's
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
out of the Indigent defense fund there's
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
no specific line for this currently
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
there are other Guardian type situations
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
where we do pay so ultimately
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
I can understand how it may be
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate to transfer this payment
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the judicial Council
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
um would I like that to occur maybe at
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the next biennium so
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
that we could include that in our budget
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
request and including maybe additional
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
staff because we get these increased
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to make payments
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely that would be far preferred
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
for me uh in this situation
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair if I could just I'm
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
realizing just as full disclosure I do
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
not accept these type of cases but I do
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
work for the do do some cases in which
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'm paid for out of an injured Fund in
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
the Probate Court
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you so just if I could follow up
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
with uh Mr sample
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to the last point and last
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
question that was raised by
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth mcbeath Macbeth
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
the transfer of funds from uh to uh I'm
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
sorry the transfer for responsibility
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
for the payment where it comes from
 
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
whether there's a reimbursement or not
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
um that would exist that I mean if even
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
if we pass the original bill there would
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
be that transfer of funding is that
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
correct absolutely okay so and you know
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
what the last thing the other thing I
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you is
 
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.069 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you is
um

00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
the purpose of having the here the the
 
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of having this hearing was
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
really based on section two of the bill
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
um do you have any
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense as to
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
um whether in the sort of in the overall
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
scheme of things it makes sense to have
 
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that question
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to answer
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
um both as sort of the my current
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
position as as an agency had for for
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
this agency but also uh
 
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
should share with you my background
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
which I know the chair knows uh as a
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
practicing lawyer who represented uh
 
00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:14.339 align:start position:0%
clients in Indigent criminal cases where
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
the office of Cost Containment was often
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
asked to collect fees
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
I have a hard time
 
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:27.980 align:start position:0%
understanding the practical value on
 
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:32.060 align:start position:0%
imposing an OCC collection requirement
 
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
from persons who are involuntarily
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
admitted the people who actually maybe
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't get admitted and are found to be
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
not a danger
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
seem to be those are the persons that
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
you would be in the position of actually
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
collecting from because they're
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
competent they can engage in a
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
conversation and yet they're now
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
involved in a court proceeding they
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
never asked to be involved in and now
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're being asked to be paid for it so
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't seem to be from my
 
00:43:04.329 --> 00:43:04.339 align:start position:0%
personal perspective a
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
effective means of collecting any real
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
relevant money substantial money for
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
purposes of what uh
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
is being expended here all right thank
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this Witness
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
all right again uh let me ask you anyone
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
who wishes to uh speak anyone further
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close a hearing on the
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
amendment to SB 128
 
00:43:44.569 --> 00:43:44.579 align:start position:0%
and I guess we're ready for executive
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
session I think we've got everybody here
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
now yes
 
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.950 align:start position:0%
now yes
um

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
so since it's my Amendment
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would uh
 
00:43:54.119 --> 00:43:55.309 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would uh
I would

00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
I would
 
00:43:55.319 --> 00:43:57.109 align:start position:0%
I would
um

00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
speak first
 
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.170 align:start position:0%
speak first
um

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand
 
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.150 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand
that

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
the original SB 28 as it came to us from
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
the Senate does two things
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
first the transfers payment
 
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.589 align:start position:0%
first the transfers payment
responsibility

00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
um from as I understand it right now uh
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
being paid
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh by the Department of Health and Human
 
00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:23.210 align:start position:0%
uh by the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh to the judicial Council
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
and secondly it removes the requirement
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I think this is very important to
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
stress here it removes the requirement
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
that exists under present law
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
that non-indigent persons repay pay or
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
repay for Council Services That's the
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
Law right now that that uh if you are
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
able to pay for and if you're provided
 
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
an attorney and you're able to repay the
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
law right now is that you are supposed
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
to repay
 
00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:58.069 align:start position:0%
to repay
um

00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
so I think my my uh proposed amendment
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that point number one
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
transferring responsibility to the
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
judicial Council that makes perfect
 
00:45:10.849 --> 00:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's a very good idea
 
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.450 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's a very good idea
um

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
point two however is where I strongly
 
00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.430 align:start position:0%
point two however is where I strongly
disagree

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
um and that was the basis for my
 
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.089 align:start position:0%
um and that was the basis for my
Amendment

00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
um as I as we've discussed before
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
section two is uh is the non-germain
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
aspect and I will address that in just a
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
second but first let me refer to section
 
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.750 align:start position:0%
second but first let me refer to section
one

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
um because I think it's important
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
um to note several things
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
um this my proposed amendment one
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
retains the requirement of current law
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
that non-indigent persons uh pay for
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
counsel uh when they receive counsel and
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's very important to
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
understand here that although the focus
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
of our discussion has been on the
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission the
 
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
three-day hearing that's not that's not
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
the only thing as the footnote as the
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note in the original Bill
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
indicates that's not the only thing
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're also talking
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
about non-emergency admissions
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
um the where that where this proposed
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
change to the council saying you don't
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
have to reimburse that would apply to
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
non-emergency admissions also where
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
right now the Supreme Court is is the
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
cause the cost of that is six hundred
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
dollars per per case and that's where
 
00:46:38.089 --> 00:46:38.099 align:start position:0%
that that's figure is where uh the the
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal note came up comes up with the
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
idea of almost of I think it's a million
 
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.550 align:start position:0%
idea of almost of I think it's a million
nine

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
um as the I'm sorry a million uh a
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
million five is the cost overall of uh
 
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
of this of of this service and it's also
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
important to emphasize that that does
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
not include the cost of ancillary
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
services like if uh and I suspect this
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
would probably be more likely to occur
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the non-emergency context
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
where there's a longer proposed uh
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
commitment or that may be a longer
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
commitment but uh investigative and
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
ancillary services like a private
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
investigator or experts or that kind of
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
thing would also be be paid
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
um by uh would be paid out of the
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
judicial Council and under the original
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
bill would not be subject to
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement even if the person could
 
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.770 align:start position:0%
reimbursement even if the person could
pay

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
um so I um I think that's I think that's
 
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
very important to understand
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
um I am completely sympathetic
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
to the idea that people many probably
 
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.220 align:start position:0%
most of the people that are facing
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
involuntary uh commitment whether it's
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
on an emergency basis and that maybe is
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
even even more uh uh uh problematic but
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
even those not a non-emergency it's
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
still an involuntary commitment that
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
those people are often in very difficult
 
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
circumstances and so I tried to word
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
this uh proposed amendment and I should
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
say in consultation with I spoke with
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
just uh with judge king about this and I
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
don't mean I don't want to misinterpret
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
his position I think he would prefer uh
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
the original amendment to my proposed
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
amendment also but I did speak with him
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
in an effort to try to alleviate some of
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns that were raised so that
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
for example the way the amendment is
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
worded it says that
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
um the person has a responsibility to
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
pay for counsel and then it goes on to
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
um if the person is unable to to pay the
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
court shall appoint an attorney who will
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
be compensated at the rate determined by
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court that's the that's the
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
current law it then goes on to say that
 
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
if the court is unable to make the
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
determination and for example the you
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
know we've heard the circumstances of
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
somebody's really in trauma uh the last
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
thing you want to do is ask them to fill
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
out a financial affidavit right now fine
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
the court can say I'm this this this
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
establishes the default position that
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
the court appoints counsel for the
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
person and then refers the matter to the
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment and they will
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
then make a report and recommendation
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
back to the court
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
it should also be noted here that the
 
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment has the ha
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
they have the discretion to make a
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the court that we
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to collect
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
any money from this person we should
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
just waive recollection efforts and my
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
understanding from having spoken to rep
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
to Charlie arlinghaus from the
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services is
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
that they do that with some frequency
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
they say when you know this is as as was
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
pointed out this is going to cost us too
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
much to try to recollect to try to
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
collect so let's not let's not try to
 
00:49:53.339 --> 00:49:54.470 align:start position:0%
collect so let's not let's not try to
collect

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so I'm
 
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:00.260 align:start position:0%
I I've tried to make this as
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
user-friendly if you will as it can be
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
so that the so that the the court and I
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
and I also think that you know we we
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
have to have some confidence in our
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
judges I I have great confidence in the
 
00:50:16.089 --> 00:50:16.099 align:start position:0%
fact that judges will be able to make
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate determinations for example
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
there may be I think I I as again I
 
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
referred to a discussion I had with
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
judge king it may very well be that that
 
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
when a judge is first facing a first
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
confronted with this situation the
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
circumstances themselves even if there's
 
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
no financial affidavit the circumstances
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
themselves may may be such that the
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
judge can make a finding this person is
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
Indigent and can't repay I mean as an
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
example suppose suppose you had a police
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
officer that brings uh that brings
 
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
somebody in and there's evidence that
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
the person has been has been homeless
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
for the last 60 days and has been
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
begging for food or something like that
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
at various places it seems to me that
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
the judge very well may say I'm based
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
upon the evidence that I've heard I'm
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
going to find this person who's Indigent
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
and doesn't have to repay
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
um now that may you know obviously there
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
are a million different circumstances
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
that might cause the judge to exercise
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
his discretion uh one way or the other
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
or to say well I'm going to appoint
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
counsel now because I don't really I
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't know but uh but I have enough
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
questions that I want the office of Cost
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
Containment uh to look into this
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
um uh but I don't see any I don't see
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
any any problem with that the other
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
thing that I guess I that I think is
 
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
kind of important if we're talking about
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
fairness here is this
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody suppose that we have
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
somebody that's you know that's sort of
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know in the middle class or upper
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
middle class or even even wealthy I
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
presume that sometimes those people can
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
be in be an emergency crisis situation
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
and have uh and be petitioned to be
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
involuntarily admitted and if that
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
person shows up with a lawyer
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
of his of of their own of their own
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
choosing and they pay for that lawyer
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
presumably at a lot more than six
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.650 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
um

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
do they get to bill the state to get
 
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
their money back can they say you know I
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
gee I hired you know ropes and gray or I
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
hired uh uh Divine millimet or some some
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
Law Firm that charged me five thousand
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
or ten thousand dollars for a hearing uh
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
I want the money back because I I didn't
 
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:29.579 align:start position:0%
ask for this hearing we would under our
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
current law we would say no I'm sorry
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
that you don't get your money back
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's just one of the things
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
that you know that's one of the things
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
that that happens and so if that's true
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
why should somebody and bear in mind I'm
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
talking about somebody who has the
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
ability to repay not somebody who
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't but if it's true that if you get
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
your own lawyer and you pay for your own
 
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
lawyer you don't you don't get to get
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
that money back from the state then why
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
should somebody who is able to repay
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
even though they may be at a lower in a
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
sort of lower economic status why do
 
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
they not have to repay and again it's
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
not we're not talking about the office
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment you know becoming
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know sort of everybody's uh
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh view of you know the villainous bill
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
collector who's calling in the middle of
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
the night or using aggressive uh efforts
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
to re to to collect money uh that
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
nothing like that is is that nothing
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
could be further from the truth
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
but why should they not have to why
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
should they not have to repay in
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they're able to
 
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
repay and the last point I would make on
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know I think we're we're
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
the suggestion has been from the
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
witnesses that
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
well these people uh are you know
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're they're all never going to be
 
00:53:59.329 --> 00:53:59.339 align:start position:0%
able to repay and they're all going to
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
be traumatized and they're all going to
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
sort of fight
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
if they have to repay but is that really
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
true may I don't doubt that that may be
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
true in many cases but isn't this sort
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
of the you know the in some sense the
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
kind of discrimination of low
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
expectations that
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
um that because this may apply to to
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
many people uh we should assume it
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
applies to all of them why isn't it why
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we assume that there will be
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
some people who are have who may have
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
had an emergency uh mental mental crisis
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
but they get over it and when they get
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
over it when somebody sends them when
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
the office of Cost Containment says hey
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
we think you can reimburse the state for
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
whatever it is a hundred dollars or 600
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
they're going to say they're going to
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
send a check why should we assume that
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be the case in in all
 
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.770 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be the case in in all
cases

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
but of course if we say that you don't
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
have to send a check then they won't I
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
would I certainly wouldn't do it if I
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
hadn't didn't have any obligation to do
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
it but I submit respectfully that the
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
law shouldn't be that you shouldn't have
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
to do that if you can't
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
and that's it I'll shut up and listen to
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else who has a view
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Turner
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
can I just ask a couple of questions
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
about what uh the statement um because
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
I'm just going back to the original
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
Senate uh referred Bill and and looking
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
at the language
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts and maybe I misheard
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
it at the beginning did you say somehow
 
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
this opens the door
 
00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:33.740 align:start position:0%
to charges for people who are not being
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed was that one no
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
no no I said it it it applies to people
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
in being involuntarily committed either
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
on an emergency basis or a non-emergency
 
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.490 align:start position:0%
on an emergency basis or a non-emergency
basis

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then then just the second point that
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify but when you were
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
saying before about people asking to be
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
reimbursed if they come in with a lawyer
 
00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
it seems in the Senate bill that it sort
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
of clearly states that it um sought to
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
be admitted and does not have legal
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
counsel so I don't know if that clears
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
up that part of of what you were saying
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
or if you were making a different point
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
because it seems to the way I'm reading
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
this it seems to suggest that that if
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
they do have legal counsel then then
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't apply to them no no no no
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
by the point that I was really making is
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
that if you under if we if we adopted
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
what that would say is if you are a
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
petitioned to be involuntarily admitted
 
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
either on an emergency basis or a
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
non-emergency basis and you show up with
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
your privately retained lawyer yes the
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
court will not appoint counsel for you
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
but my point would be if you show up
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
with your own lawyer and you pay your
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
lawyer you don't get to you don't get to
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
charge the state you don't get to say oh
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
listen I just got this bill from Divine
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
millimet for five thousand dollars uh
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
State I want you to reimburse me that
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
that was my point
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it does I don't see how I read
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
that in here but but because it does
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
sort of say this pertains to people who
 
00:57:05.809 --> 00:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
do not have legal counsel but
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah no no I guess my I guess what I'm
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
saying is you're right it's not in there
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
so that since there's no since there's
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
no provision in the law that says if you
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
if you pay your own lawyer you get to to
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
suit to uh charge the state for it you
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
don't get to do that because it's not in
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you thank
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I just want
 
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
to clarify your testimony here today
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying that um as you understand
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
it this bill judges currently without
 
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:38.420 align:start position:0%
have the discretion to declare someone
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
Indigent without the filing of a
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit yes I think they do
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
I think they do and that's going to
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
expand to the 604 as well
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
to that RSA 604
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
um you mean it's actually the section
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
the section also that you're I mean I I
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
suppose theoretically although you know
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
I I I agree that it would be if somebody
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
if you were talking about it because 604
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
Maya section 2 is not limited to
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
um uh involuntary admissions it could
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
apply in other circumstances and so I
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
guess I would I would I would agree that
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
in other circumstances if you're not
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
talking about somebody that is more
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
likely to be incompetent
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
um then maybe it is less likely that the
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
court could do that without a financial
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
affidavit but I suppose there could be
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
circumstances which the court could
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
um then that this if this change would
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
be inconsistent with the court rules
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
that require State appointed attorneys
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
to file the approved financial affidavit
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't could put a chilling
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
effect on their ability to be paid
 
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.650 align:start position:0%
effect on their ability to be paid
terribly

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
terribly
 
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:52.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
no no this doesn't have anything to do
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
when a court appointed attorney files
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
their bill with the court to be paid
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
they need to file the the copy of the
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit that's approved with
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
the court order saying that
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
um the person is indigent
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
right plus their itemized Bill and their
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
order of appointments so
 
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
well if the court if the court has made
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
a finding and has issued an order that
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
the person is Indigent
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I would I would be very surprised if
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
that wasn't if you would if you didn't
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
if you attached that to your bill I
 
00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised if you wouldn't
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
get paid I wouldn't be surprised
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
generally the the judicial council is
 
00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
generally the the judicial council is
very

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.829 align:start position:0%
very
um

00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
pays attention to everything that's in
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
are there yes uh representative
 
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.569 align:start position:0%
are there yes uh representative

Stapleton
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the question and the answer
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the question of Representative
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
other cases
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
because before I heard that
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
I was taking a broad view other cases
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
where well I know it says other sections
 
01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
of this chapter
 
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
but for those of us who are not
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
practicing attorneys and not familiar
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
with how the
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
segment these sort of things
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
my mind thought that it could be applied
 
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
to any other tort or even criminal cases
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
so I think other cases it would have
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
been helpful to have that Modified by
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
the voluntary or involuntary admission
 
01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:35.579 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I'm having
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
some problems with
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
kind of the unclear and open nature of
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
other cases in the section too
 
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.470 align:start position:0%
other cases in the section too
and

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise if that were clear I feel that
 
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
section 2 would support an edify section
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
one section one makes it a given
 
01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.299 align:start position:0%
that the person is responsible for the
 
01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
charges unless indigency can be
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
determined and
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
in if the need is there then the court
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
appoints an attorney for that
 
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.130 align:start position:0%
appoints an attorney for that
determination

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:12.140 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm perfectly comfortable with
 
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
And subscribe to section one
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
but section two leaves me a little
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
queasy without the clarification of that
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
voluntary and involuntary aspect of
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
admissions sure no no that's that's was
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
the emergency I should say either
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
emergency or non-emergency of the
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
involuntary admission sure no no you
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
know that was the point that
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith made and and I I
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
have to say given given the comments of
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
both of you
 
01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.069 align:start position:0%
both of you
um

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
you know I I take those I I give very
 
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
serious weight to this I I guess what I
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
would what I would say is
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh as a point of clarification but this
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
may you know this sort of suggests that
 
01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
we representative Smith's proposed
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
amendment is the better way to go but
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
what I what I was saying is in answered
 
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:09.299 align:start position:0%
your question I actually was section two
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
I was not specifically thinking of
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
emergency of uh involuntary admissions I
 
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
was I had drafted section two as kind of
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
a catch-all because for the reasons I
 
01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
said before this sort of issue has come
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
up enough where the court of appoints an
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
attorney for some reason in some you
 
01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
know some case that had not been sort of
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
thought about before and then the court
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
is concerned that that's going to come
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
out of the Court's budget where they the
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
court really believes it should come out
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the judicial Council budget and so
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's why I drafted section two it
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
really had nothing to do with with uh
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
involuntary admissions as such it was
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
just that
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
the the fact that that issue came on you
 
01:02:56.049 --> 01:02:56.059 align:start position:0%
know here was yet another circumstance
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
involving involuntary admissions where
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
the question came up of who should pay
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
and I just thought I'd draft section two
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
as a let's just have a catch-all
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
provision so that if some if some other
 
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
thing arises in the future we know where
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
the payment comes from but
 
01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate your your concern because
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
candidly I'd have to say I don't as we
 
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
as I sit here right now I don't know
 
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:23.660 align:start position:0%
what those other circumstances might be
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
and it I have to I would have to concede
 
01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:29.579 align:start position:0%
that it might make sense to have a
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing you know to introduce that part
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill next year and have a hearing
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
and people can testify and see if there
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
really are any other circumstances so I
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
mean that I'm I think you raise a very
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
good point representative Smith
 
01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:47.180 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could just follow up on
 
01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
this recent exchange I'm a little
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
confused because you've mentioned
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
um the involuntary admissions several
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
times in your comments but as I
 
01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:01.339 align:start position:0%
understand it that is a civil
 
01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
procedure whereas very specifically
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
section 2 deals with proceedings in
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
criminal cases and involuntary admission
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
is not a criminal case
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
I say that as a non-lawyer and certainly
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
is a non-judge so you can feel free to
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
correct well you know no you know you
 
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
know what you that's you're right in
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
this in this sense it does expand it
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
to to these kinds of proceedings but
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
section 604a even though it is in the
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
criminal law section already does have
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
does apply to juvenile cases which are
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
not criminal cases either those are
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
though now there's there's an analogy
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
obviously between a juvenile delinquency
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
case and a criminal case but those are
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
specifically defined in the law 169b as
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
not being criminal cases so
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
I understand your point but I think that
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
it probably is not a bad idea to to
 
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.089 align:start position:0%
it probably is not a bad idea to to
house

01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
if you were going to have section two it
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
would probably not be a bad idea to
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
house it in 604a
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I'm I'm not
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable with what I'm about to ask
 
01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.470 align:start position:0%
comfortable with what I'm about to ask
but

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:21.299 align:start position:0%
I know but I'm still going to ask it I
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
believe firmly in the separation of
 
01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:24.650 align:start position:0%
believe firmly in the separation of
powers

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
powers
 
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
and we have three separate branches
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I would want to do
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
is put any member
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch in an
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable position
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
but I wonder if there
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
are any
 
01:05:49.319 --> 01:05:52.250 align:start position:0%
are any
clarifications

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
clarifications
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
could share with us based on the
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
discussions that have been taking place
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
up until now
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
so indirectly I'm asking you what you
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.010 align:start position:0%
think about
that

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
all right all right
 
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:15.500 align:start position:0%
in other words are you asking if judge
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
yeah everybody I'm looking at you
 
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
Justice game I would I guess what I
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
would I would like judge king to feel
 
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
absolutely free to say that he has
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
nothing to add and I would completely
 
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:30.980 align:start position:0%
respect that
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
but if he were to think that he could
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
um clarify any perhaps vagueness or
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
misconceptions that we have then and if
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
you were willing to share that I would
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
like to hear it how's that is that a
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
better way to put it that's fine but he
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
is free to say he has nothing else to
 
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.870 align:start position:0%
is free to say he has nothing else to
say

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
I looked around it looks like I'm the
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
only one here for the judicial branch so
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
my name is David King I'm the
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the Circuit
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
Court I think microphone judge it's red
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
is it good yeah you're on it's on you
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
just have to speak into it I think
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
I've learned this morning that the
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendment is the second
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
part which I did speak about with the
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
chair and I think what we were
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
contemplating is there any case criminal
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
or civil juvenile abuse neglect
 
01:07:22.619 --> 01:07:24.529 align:start position:0%
or civil juvenile abuse neglect
guardianship

01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
where under 490 31 the judicial branch
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
is on the hook for the fees if there's
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
not a specific statute and I think at
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
one point the example was appointing
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
counsel for a parent in an abuse neglect
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
case after the Supreme Court found that
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
that was not a constitutional right and
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
there was a point where we couldn't
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel for parents unless we
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch paid so I think
 
01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the scenario that you're
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
thinking of and I think
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
um 604 and Mr sample can correct me if
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but 604
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
um it says proceedings in criminal cases
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
adequate representation for Indigent
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
defendants in criminal cases and then it
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
says appointment and payment for Council
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
and ancillary services in other cases so
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's not limited to just
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
so in in 604 as it the way it's worded
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
right now correct right I think for
 
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
example appointment of Council in an
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect case which is clearly not
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
a criminal case is paid out of 604a so I
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
think it's not it's even though criminal
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
is mentioned I think it's wider than
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
that and so and then there's some
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
not confusion maybe but you've taught
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
you've just for point of clarification
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
an iea is the involuntary emergency
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
admission those are the ones that
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
are on a very short timeline I did those
 
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
hearings Monday morning
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh the docking and Concord Monday
 
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:51.950 align:start position:0%
uh the docking and Concord Monday
morning

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
on the 11 o'clock list there were two
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
cases one was filed at 9 34 that morning
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
one was filed at 9 45 so the files were
 
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
opened in the clerk's office at 9 30 in
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
the morning I had a hearing at 11 and my
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
guess is the orders went out around 11
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
30. so those cases were actually opened
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
in our court for maybe two and a half
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
hours in their clothes and we're done
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
with them so
 
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
any finding of energy is going to have
 
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
to occur after the fact we have to
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel and lucky we can find a
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer on 15 minutes notice to get a
 
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
hold of the client and prepare and and
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
do the hearing so we've talked about
 
01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman about how we would
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
implement this and obviously we would
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
try our best at a hearing and those two
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
cases one was a 15 year old girl that's
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
pretty easy and the second was a 22 year
 
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
old who had been released from the state
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
hospital three hours before being picked
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
up to be re-i8 I think the Judge would
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
be able to check boxes on those easily
 
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:51.299 align:start position:0%
but we we don't have the ability to get
 
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
a financial affidavit obviously on the
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
front end of an iea case that's opened
 
01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
but you know can I just ask you my
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
understanding is as I look at the
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
statute I understand that the the the
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know the the emergency admission is
 
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
presents the the particular issues
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about but the the
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
right if we were to pass the original
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
Bill well uh under either the original
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
bill or my Amendment or representative
 
01:10:23.649 --> 01:10:23.659 align:start position:0%
Smith's Amendment the the council right
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
applies not only to emergency admission
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
but even to the longer term I mean if
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
you still have the right to counsel and
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel if you're Indigent
 
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
even in the longer term admission
 
01:10:39.169 --> 01:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
correct and so the fee for the iea is
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
negotiated by contract with the judicial
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
branch and the four lawyers who take
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
those cases they were getting paid 62 a
 
01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:46.850 align:start position:0%
those cases they were getting paid 62 a
case

01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
by Department of Health and Human
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
Services even though the statute
 
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
actually required I think a fair reading
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
was the court to appoint in Pay we never
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
have done that and because we changed
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
the process and and sped it up and we
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
now most of the hearings we conduct the
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
petitionee or the patient is actually in
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
an acute care hospital one of the 26
 
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
acute care hospitals around the state
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more work for the lawyers so
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
we negotiated the hundred dollar fee the
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
65 fee that's been mentioned I believe
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
that applies to when someone is on a
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
conditional discharge from the hospital
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
and that's revoked they're entitled to
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
an administrative hearing it doesn't
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
involve the courts I think DHHS pays 65
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
for that so that's that's apples and
 
01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
oranges to this the involuntary
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
commitments what I call the probate
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
commitments that's about 600 cases a
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
year this the Supreme Court has a cap of
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
six hundred dollars but those cases are
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
on a 15-day cycle and they the fees
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
rarely get close to 600 because they're
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
done pretty quickly but I think you're
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
right Mr chairman this statute applies
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
to both categories they're both under
 
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.709 align:start position:0%
to both categories they're both under
135c

01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
135c
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry no question so thank
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry did you have a question yeah I
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
guess just following up on on the
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
thought of the voluntary versus or the
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
emergency versus
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
non-emergency and sorry if I'm
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
struggling with this because I'm just
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
not familiar but uh the the original
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
statute covers both in your opinion
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
emergent and non-emergent
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
um with the non-emergent
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
involuntary admissions still basically
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
require representation
 
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.010 align:start position:0%
require representation
yes

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
and those fees are currently still paid
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
by DHHS we don't we don't we don't um
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
pay those Judiciary Council
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that there's any
 
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.890 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that there's any
immediate

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
immediate
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
discussion about changing that but for
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's always been done the
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
council submit their fees to the court
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
and we pass them through to DHHS they
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
also pay the fees for the independent
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists which are much higher
 
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.410 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists which are much higher
um

01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
in addition to the council fees
 
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.530 align:start position:0%
in addition to the council fees
currently

01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
but I I mean I guess you know I guess
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying but I
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
guess if you read either the original
 
01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:10.820 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
or either representative Smith or my
 
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.470 align:start position:0%
or either representative Smith or my
Amendment

01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
that seems to say that whatever the
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
practice has been the the those funds
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
should come out of the judicial Council
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's the way the bill is worded right
 
01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:26.510 align:start position:0%
that's the way the bill is worded right
now

01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
right the statute that's being amended
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
is in the section of 135c that deals
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
with ieas but I think a fair reading is
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
it says under this chapter which is 135c
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly yes representative
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
Macbeth thank you Mr would you allow me
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
to ask my question I had asked before
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that someone said judge king would be
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
best to answer about what is what is the
 
01:13:47.169 --> 01:13:47.179 align:start position:0%
threshold of indigency
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
benefits concluded in income how how
 
01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
Indigent do you have to be to
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
qualify anyone that is on only exempt
 
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
income Social Security those kinds of
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
income is automatically under our rules
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
entitled to appointed counsel
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
um we we have not developed
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
um guidelines for this particular case
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
type yet
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that I've been doing
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
these for a while I don't think many
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
people are going to be able to pay
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
Council fees they're in a mental state
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
such that they're danger to themselves
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
or others by the nature of the case so I
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
think the biggest concern that we will
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
have in implementing this is just how to
 
01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
parse that out and it's going to be I
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
think OCC that's going to have to figure
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
that out not the court the way this bill
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
is worded
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
I think that was the intention that
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right that was the
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
intent to have and as I said I did speak
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
to commissioner arlinghaus about this
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
and you know that's I mean that's what
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
So currently is the determination
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
for if somebody can pay or not generally
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
made by the court or how is it generally
 
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
made right now if if you're gonna seek
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of the fees I just want to
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand if this is changing the
 
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
current process as it is today or if
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's relatively similar if you could
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
please explain I'd appreciate it sure So
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
currently for the what I'll call the
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
mental health case is the 135c both the
 
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
ieas and the probate commitments those
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
fees have been paid for many years by
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
DHHS I don't know if there's any process
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
to seek reimbursement but generally in
 
01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
the court system if it's a criminal case
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
before we appoint Council we require a
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit the the major
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
difference being those cases go on for
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
for months and so there's plenty of time
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
on the front end of the case to make
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
um same in the abuse neglect cases the
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
any anytime we appoint counsel we get a
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit and determine an
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
agency guardianships of incapacitated
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
adults on the 464a there's a financial
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit that's completed and if
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
they're eligible under our guidelines we
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
appoint counsel we have Point counsel
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
anyway uh but if they are not eligible
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
then there's a reimbursement on the back
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
end of the case but the difference I
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
think and I think the important
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
distinction is that these cases move so
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
quickly that we certainly in the ieas
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability on the front end
 
01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
of the case to determine indigency which
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
is why I think the bill was drafted in
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
such a way that that would be up to OCC
 
01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
we would do what we could add a hearing
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
to see if the judge could make that
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
quick determination which in in many
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
cases I think will be the case but in
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
the case where it's not clear
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to track the
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
person down we may not have a good
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
address and maybe someone who is
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
presently homeless or the petitioner is
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
a a friend or just getting the petition
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
filed but doesn't have complete
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
information about the petition e who's
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
stuck in a hospital somewhere and so
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
there may be OCC may have some trouble
 
01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
tracking the person down on the back end
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
of the case but again we would do
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
everything that we could at the time of
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing whether it was two hours
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
after it was filed or or two days to to
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
see if we could make if the judge could
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
make that determination at a hearing and
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully check a box uh if it's if
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a finding of no
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
intimacy and that and close the file
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up question
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
um if that determination was made and
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
you would check that box I wanted to
 
01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:26.540 align:start position:0%
kind of follow up on Macbeth's question
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
would that be accepted by the court as
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know the documentation that the
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
person couldn't pay if the judge had
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
checked off this box to ensure that this
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
attorney would in fact be reimbursed
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
their their fee and we wouldn't be
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
making them
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
fill out even more paperwork to try and
 
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
determine if the judge had already
 
01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.810 align:start position:0%
determine if the judge had already
determined

01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
they'll be paid by the judicial Council
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
the question is whether OCC will recoup
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
that hundred dollars sometime down the
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
road so the lawyers are going to get
 
01:17:53.699 --> 01:17:55.070 align:start position:0%
road so the lawyers are going to get
paid

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
I if I answered your question
 
01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
I if I answered your question
representative

01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
and it won't be as we won't re require
 
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
the notice of appointment the financial
 
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
affidavit and the itemized bill because
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's a flat fee and the lawyers get paid
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
that fee the hearings done they've done
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions saying none thank
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
could I just quickly ask clarification
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
you've referred several times to the
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
original Bill do you mean the original
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill or do you mean the bill as amended
 
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
by the Senate as it came to us I'm sorry
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
I I meant the bill as amended by the
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you
 
01:18:38.699 --> 01:18:39.470 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you
um

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
so um I I guess I want to go around as
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
to whether there's any further
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
discussion but I I guess what I what I'd
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
really like to say is I
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
I think and maybe I'm being overly
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
optimistic I I think
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
that there may not be
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of difference between the
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
positions around the table in in this
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
sense I'm I've tried to draft this bill
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
in a way that gives the cler the court
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
and the office of Cost Containment
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
maximum flexibility to deal with the
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of situations that they are likely
 
01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:23.300 align:start position:0%
to deal with in many cases involving
 
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
involuntary admissions whether it's on
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
an emergency basis or not
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
while still retaining the principle
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
that if a person can repay
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
they should repay and I think that's I
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
guess I would say I think that's an
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
important principle
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
um and I think it reflects a principle
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
of fairness because if somebody does get
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
their own lawyer and pays their own
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
lawyer they don't get to have that
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the state
 
01:19:58.570 --> 01:19:58.580 align:start position:0%
so why should somebody who by definition
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
is able to repay
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
but gets a free attorney at the outset
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
not have to repay and again it's not to
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
you know that the the OCC is going to
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
become this you know terrible collection
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
agency that's uh calling people in the
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
middle of the night and doing all those
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
things that's not the way OCC has ever
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
operated but why shouldn't they be able
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
to make the the
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
do what they need to do to uh to uh
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
seek reimbursement from somebody who's
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
gotten a free service and as I said
 
01:20:34.739 --> 01:20:35.870 align:start position:0%
gotten a free service and as I said
before

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
why do we why do why is it appropriate
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
to think that
 
01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:45.140 align:start position:0%
no one that everybody who is is uh is
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
asked to reimburse will be
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um will not be will not say uh you know
 
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
here yes I owe the money and here's the
 
01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
and here's the uh here's the check why
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
is it a pro why should we be thinking
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
that nobody will do that and that's
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
really all this bill says is that if you
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
can pay you should pay so that that's
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
why I favor the bill you know my that's
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
um representative Turner
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to lift up I guess
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
one of the statements from and I'm
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
struggling to figure out which of our of
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
our Witnesses in the hearing said it
 
01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.130 align:start position:0%
our Witnesses in the hearing said it
um

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
that with involuntary admission I think
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
for me the distinction is that the
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
person's not seeking
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
um any services in other words this is
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
not something that someone came and said
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
I wish to be defended against you know
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
the the charges against me or anything
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
like that that this is this is basically
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
something that the state is doing to
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
this person over there essentially
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
either objection or or inability to to
 
01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.130 align:start position:0%
either objection or or inability to to
object

01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
object
 
01:21:59.810 --> 01:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and I think to me that's maybe the
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
distinction between why we would or
 
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
would not seek reimbursement for
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
um the services is really because the
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
person's not asking for the service it's
 
01:22:11.689 --> 01:22:11.699 align:start position:0%
really the state that's asking for the
 
01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
service and the way I'm thinking about
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
it sure but so can I just but I mean
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
then then should we uh should we have
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
another amendment to the bill that says
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
if you if you are one of the few people
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's Bill Gates and you pay your own
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
attorney then you can re you can bill
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
I mean why wouldn't that be fair then
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
too because you haven't in in that
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
circumstance you haven't asked for that
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
proceeding either
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
right I guess what I'm saying is Bill
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
Gates would not if he's being
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
involuntarily admitted would not be
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
asking you know for someone to represent
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
him the court essentially is saying in
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
order to to make this a fair process
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
they need somebody appointed so that so
 
01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:54.020 align:start position:0%
that they're not you know essentially
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
incapacitated and unable to
 
01:22:57.659 --> 01:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
incapacitated and unable to
um

01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know unable to accept or not accept
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know the help of the court so
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh if yes representative Stapleton
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
I think section one makes it clear
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and it enables people with means
 
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
to be billed for
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
the legal
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:27.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
but you know dealing with these folks
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
that need
 
01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
that need an involuntary admission
 
01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
emergency or non-emergency
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
they happen to be involved as a POA in a
 
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
case with an Indigent homeless person
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
and it is one horrendous
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
huge gigantic chore
 
01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
eliciting information
 
01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
I've got about two volumes four inches
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
thick of the person's history
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
person is like relates to the Johnny
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
Cash song I've Been Everywhere Man
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
and he has been and I have been able to
 
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
determine his financial subsistence and
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and he's only on SSI has no assets
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
has no other income no pensions
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and he dissipates that because of his
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
mental condition and to um
 
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
an email romance fraud scam
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
and we have to keep him away from his
 
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
money in order not to dissipate those
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
funds that he needs for his living and
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
expenses and
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
medical and so forth um
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
he doesn't even want to pay his own debt
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
obligations which amount to about twenty
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars now so as his POA
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm doing is trying to
 
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
manage him away from his money and
 
01:24:59.290 --> 01:24:59.300 align:start position:0%
trying to clear up some of his debts
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
because the principle we live by if you
 
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
pay your debts otherwise it's tough to
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
service us if you take something and
 
01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay for it and willfully
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay for it
 
01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:15.620 align:start position:0%
but this person is on the verge of being
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
in a court petition for
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh involuntary admission
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to kind of help him
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
along and give them some instruction as
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
to why we need to he needs to pay his
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
debts while paying his debts and
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate more Court actions to try to
 
01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
collect money from him
 
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:38.900 align:start position:0%
so I can understand
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
the the need to help these folks and
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
they they need we need to decide for
 
01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
them when they're incapable of decision
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
um to care for themselves or to manage
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
their money or to be even able to live
 
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:54.260 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
but when somebody comes into the process
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's got a family wealth subsistence
 
01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.790 align:start position:0%
that's got a family wealth subsistence
resources

01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.810 align:start position:0%
resources
um

01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
which is probably the smaller part of
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
these sort of cases I would I would
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
assume that they're going to pay for it
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
and they should pay for anything that's
 
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.930 align:start position:0%
and they should pay for anything that's
uh

01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
done for their benefit and even though
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
they might be unwilling
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
they need to be in care
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
and they need to be admitted and you
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
know that costs money and the taxpayers
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
got to pay for that
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
so if there is an ability to pay I
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
believe that there should be
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
payment and if you can't determine it
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
right off because the emergency nature
 
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
and the short hearing process then after
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
the fact as section one provides to
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
enable recovery from those persons who
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
are capable
 
01:26:56.770 --> 01:26:56.780 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what section one does
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
once again I I like section two to
 
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
reinforce the concept of the right of
 
01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:07.460 align:start position:0%
Council and legal assistance
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
but expanding it into
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
cover into criminal and tort um
 
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's like stretching your
 
01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:20.420 align:start position:0%
arm out here to refer to an obligation
 
01:27:24.649 --> 01:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
or a process I I just come to be
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with section two I'm sorry
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
about that no no I hear you I think you
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
you and representative Smith have raised
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
very valid points that persuade me that
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
I've I I will go with her proposal
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative kutab and then
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
so I guess the part that has really
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
stuck with me is that the person is also
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
not asking for mental health treatment
 
01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.830 align:start position:0%
not asking for mental health treatment
and

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
if there's an ability to pay the
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
hospital is going to make them reimburse
 
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
for the mental health costs because
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
those aren't free if the person can't
 
01:27:58.729 --> 01:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
pay then no they don't they won't have
 
01:27:59.810 --> 01:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
to but it's going to be the same
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
situation where the hospital is not
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to immediately be able to
 
01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
determine their financial status
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
and they're going to provide them the
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
emergency services but then after the
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
fact they're either going to have to
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
use their insurance if they have it or
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
if they don't have it and they have an
 
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
ability to pay they'll have to pay or if
 
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
they have no ability to pay it all then
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the hospital will set
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
them up with another program but I think
 
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I do sympathize with the fact that
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
it is completely stressful but in
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
weighing it
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
is a hundred dollar attorney Bill really
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to be like the the height of their
 
01:28:38.450 --> 01:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
stress when they've also got potentially
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh thirty thousand dollar mental health
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
treatment bill you know on the same
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
because we have to be realistic those
 
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
mental health bills are
 
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive so I guess with
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
those points in mind and weighing it out
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's similar to the way that the law
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
already is today
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
and if the judge can determine at the
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
time that's great just to alleviate the
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
person's concerns that maybe they'll be
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
charged later
 
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
and if the judge can't determine then
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
when they're able and in a better State
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
they could fill out the paperwork
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully with help
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan yes I well
 
01:29:17.570 --> 01:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
underlining what
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
General lady just said of the uh I think
 
01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
the individual regardless of whether or
 
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
not they have interior and practice
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
funded their proposal if they're getting
 
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
to the points where they're getting
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
involuntarily admission hearing Aaron
 
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
pretty severe crisis the system hasn't
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
worked and I'm not too troubled if they
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
get a what seems to be a fairly small
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
attorney's fee we did hear that it cost
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
almost as much they don't go after these
 
01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
fees anyway because it would cost more
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
to recover them than it does to uh just
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
write off the fee so I'm not too worried
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
somebody gets even six hundred dollars
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
for an attorney you know I'm not can't
 
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
imagine Bill Gates be in this situation
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
there may be other billionaires we've
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
seen in the news lately could get in
 
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
that situation but um so I would say uh
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
I would say what the Senate has seems
 
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:08.219 align:start position:0%
like the best solution to problem I'm
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
not really
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm going to lose too much
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
sleep over somebody getting a few
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in free services I'm not
 
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
sure whether you're chasing these people
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
is a good idea
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
anyway and also of course
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
um if it's involuntarily Mission um the
 
01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:23.689 align:start position:0%
um if it's involuntarily Mission um the
person

01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
by definition doesn't want to get to
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Services they want to be back out on the
 
01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
street and really
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
most of the time people are advocating
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
for people in that kind of Crisis
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
they're having a hard time even getting
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
the services so this is uh
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
kind of uh we're kind of looking at the
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
we may be looking at the uh like say the
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
telescope through the wrong end of the
 
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
if you may be looking at it at the wrong
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
end of the telescope that you know
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
probably the bigger problem is probably
 
01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
people who need Services
 
01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
um can be convinced to get to services
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
but who can't get them so I'm uh
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
you know there's probably a fairly small
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
number of cases where the advocate we're
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
like The Advocate could even be
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
successful in uh getting the person uh
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know not admitted to get to services
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
so which of course are much more
 
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
expensive than the legal fees too so
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
other yes representative Stapleton
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
um testimony by uh representative Oregon
 
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
is helpful to put it in perspective but
 
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
under under the section one if there's
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
investigative expert or other services
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
in connection with the hearings held
 
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
under this chapter
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
I got to imagine that that could run
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
into some substantial money
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
um and once again with my experience a
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
lot of time was devoted in uncovering
 
01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
the financial capabilities or that lack
 
01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:49.139 align:start position:0%
thereof of of the
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
the person I'm a POA for so I could
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
appreciate well the flat fee is not a
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
big matter investigative reporting and
 
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
other services could be
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
fairly substantial
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Macbeth thank you um
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
I have to just input here it's really is
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
quite a privilege for anyone to not
 
01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
think that a hundred dollars a month is
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of money for some
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the people that live in our
 
01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:22.580 align:start position:0%
communities I know for a fact that it is
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
and that's just one hundred dollars and
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
particularly if you've been
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed and you're
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
trying to save money for a down payment
 
01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:32.870 align:start position:0%
trying to save money for a down payment
to

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
um you know get in an apartment have a
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
deposit a hundred dollars will keep you
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
out of that place to live and you'll
 
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
find yourself unhoused again and perhaps
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the same situation that you were so I
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
also know that these cord
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
these fees to be paid back that's going
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
to be a court order so that's also going
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
to be something that's going to be held
 
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
against you and can be brought forward
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
in any
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
um you know and if you default on it or
 
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
whatever I don't I don't know all the
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
procedures of that but I
 
01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:04.310 align:start position:0%
procedures of that but I
um

01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
it is significant and I um I just need
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
to speak up for the part of the
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
communities that I know that this will
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
could be a significant setback
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
financially for people that are at the
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable parts of of our towns
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
other comments yes representative
 
01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:25.129 align:start position:0%
other comments yes representative
Edwards

01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think one's a a clarification for me
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
and then another is just something I
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
haven't heard yet and uh clarification I
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
think is that this is about trying to uh
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
have those with the ability to pay to
 
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
pay and so for those people a hundred
 
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
dollars is a hundred dollars because
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to pay for it uh I
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's the clarification I'm
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
seeking we're talking about people who
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
have the ability to pay right that's
 
01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
right and I guess I would say my my
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
understanding I think this they've been
 
01:33:58.970 --> 01:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
doing this for years and years in
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
criminal cases they the office of Cost
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
Containment in you and to use
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth's situation uh
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
example they may very well say to that
 
01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
person wait all you can afford to pay is
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
ten dollars a month and then and then
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
the second thing but I just don't think
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
I've heard anyone mention is that these
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
Services aren't free somebody's paying
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
for them uh the New Hampshire taxpayer
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
we should always remember the New
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers in the room with us
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about spending money
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
even if they've not been invited to
 
01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
provide testimony
 
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
excellent point other yes uh I'm sorry
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative germanna German I'm sorry
 
01:34:42.649 --> 01:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
that's going to remember your name I
 
01:34:44.209 --> 01:34:44.219 align:start position:0%
promise that's that's fine I appreciate
 
01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to to to make uh my
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
points as someone who uh didn't have any
 
01:34:52.129 --> 01:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
background on this bill until I was uh
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know volunteered to be a sub and
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
then did a little bit of reading up on
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
it so it could be informed but my
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
question coming in was whether or not
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
the Amendments spoke to an actual
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
physical impact or whether it was the
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
principle of the idea that people who
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
have the means should should pay it
 
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
seems to me if we're looking at a
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
million five I think that the chair
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier in terms of a
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
physical note the vast majority of that
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
it seems to be very clear we're not
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
going to recoup right we're talking
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
about a very rare number of maybe even
 
01:35:28.129 --> 01:35:28.139 align:start position:0%
hypothetical cases where people do have
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
the means and then we would pursue
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
um we would pursue repayment in that
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
case we're talking about a small number
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
of people that we would be spending
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
money that we Pro we may not even be
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
able to recoup the amount of money that
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
we're spending trying to get that money
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
back and so if this is primarily about
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
the principle which it seems to be it
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be ultimately about
 
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
physical impact on the state it's about
 
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
the principle and are we going to spend
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money maybe not even break it
 
01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659 align:start position:0%
even pursuing based on principle a very
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
small number of cases so uh that that's
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
the question I had coming in as it said
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that ultimately both for
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
the well-being of the individuals
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
involved and considering New Hampshire
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers ultimately uh it's not worth
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
it to pursue it simply on the grounds of
 
01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
it to pursue it simply on the grounds of
principle

01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
principle
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
other comments yeah yes representative
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
yeah just building on that because I I
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
feel like there's kind of two levels to
 
01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.570 align:start position:0%
feel like there's kind of two levels to
this

01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and the the first level and maybe I'm
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
still misunderstanding this book but I
 
01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:36.659 align:start position:0%
believe judge king when when uh he was
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
speaking to us said that that currently
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
if if the Senate bill as amended
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
um encompasses both emergent and
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
non-emergent involuntary admissions that
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
the more expensive non-emergent
 
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
involuntary admissions are already being
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
paid for by the state and it seems as
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
though uh I think it was DHHS if if I
 
01:36:59.450 --> 01:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
got that right you know isn't seeking
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
for that representation again because
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's involuntary you know and then the
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
second piece I think Falls to what I
 
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
think representative tremonta just spoke
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
to which is on the other instance the
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
amount of money that is at stake is
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
generally going to be so low that that
 
01:37:16.679 --> 01:37:18.050 align:start position:0%
generally going to be so low that that
the

01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:18.890 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
that that the the the process of even
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not to refer it
 
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
for collections
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
um might exceed or or or consume almost
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
all of the value
 
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
um so I think with those two ideas in
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
mind I think I probably I favor the
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
Senate version because it doesn't seem
 
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:40.860 align:start position:0%
like we're necessarily moving toward a a
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
better solution I think the Senate
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
version which basically says if you show
 
01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
up you don't have legal counsel for an
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
involuntary admission it will be
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
provided it seems like a pretty good
 
01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:51.950 align:start position:0%
provided it seems like a pretty good
standard

01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
I I my I I could be wrong but I thought
 
01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
that the witnesses who testified about
 
01:37:59.649 --> 01:37:59.659 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
non-uh emergency admissions in not
 
01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions involuntary
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
admissions I thought said they don't
 
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
know whether what HHS does in terms of
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
trying to seek reimbursement and I don't
 
01:38:12.530 --> 01:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that question
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
either although I would say
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're not taking any
 
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:22.139 align:start position:0%
action to seek reimbursement under the
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
existing law which says that a person
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
who is not Indigent is required to pay
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
then they're not complying with with
 
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.189 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
uh

01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
A lot's been said uh
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to add my two cents worths
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill well admirable is a
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
little open-ended
 
01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.850 align:start position:0%
little open-ended
uh

01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:58.129 --> 01:38:58.139 align:start position:0%
all you have to do to qualify is not
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
show up with a
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
legal counsel to qualify for the uh the
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
cost of such court appointed attorneys
 
01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
including Consul and investigative
 
01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
expert or other services and expense
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
approved by the Circuit Court
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's a little open-ended in my mind
 
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I would believe that uh
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
the uh amendment by representative Lynn
 
01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
closes that door a little bit so I I'm
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
in favor of the uh the amendment thank
 
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.590 align:start position:0%
in favor of the uh the amendment thank
you

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative kuta
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I was a bit
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
confused so I did just open up the
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
current statue and currently it says the
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
client or person sought to be admitted
 
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
shall pay the cost of the legal services
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
in connection with hearings held under
 
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
if the client or person sought to be
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
admitted is unable to pay the court show
 
01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
a point to member of the New Hampshire
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
legal council who shall be compensated
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
as determined by the court so currently
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
as it stands today the person is
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
required to pay so I don't
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
think if I just want to make sure I'm
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly your Amendment
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
isn't changing really what the current
 
01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
process is that much it's just changing
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
the office that's paying it that's
 
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
correct that that the current law is as
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
I just said that if that in these
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
proceedings you are required to pay
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
unless you can't pay and nothing in
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
either my Amendment or representative
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
Smith's Amendment changes that it's the
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
as we as we got it from the Senate that
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
one further question of my name
 
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
so the way that it currently is today it
 
01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't even say anything about if if
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
they can't determine it so it would seem
 
01:40:55.129 --> 01:40:55.139 align:start position:0%
like your amendment is actually offering
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
an alternate course some flexibility for
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody if they're unable to
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
determine it because otherwise right now
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
you have to make the determination under
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
the current law the way it stands today
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
so is this offering more flexibility
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
well it's I I suppose in some sense yes
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think the the the the thing that we
 
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
don't really know is what is HHS doing I
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
mean they have a contract with with us
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know for some people to provide uh
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
these Services what do they do that I
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
assume if they're following the law they
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
are trying to collect uh from people who
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
who are able to reimburse but we don't
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
you know I I guess I would assume they
 
01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
so but but this my proposed amendment or
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's proposed
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
amendment makes no changes to that
 
01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:41:49.679 --> 01:41:50.450 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
are we I guess what I would do is what I
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
would do is this um
 
01:41:58.370 --> 01:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
in light of the comments that have been
 
01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
made by both representative Smith and
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Stapleton I'm I am
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
not going to I'm going to withdraw my
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment and I am going to
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
2023-1676h which is Representatives
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
representative Smith cement
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair while you are the chair
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
you cannot move my Amendment unless I
 
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
bring the amendment to the committee
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
um because this this amendment
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
I have it here I have all the copies
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
here it has not you know I
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
I would have to decide in fact if I
 
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
would not just have informed people that
 
01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:52.940 align:start position:0%
I have this amendment but actually
 
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
introduce it to the committee
 
01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.649 align:start position:0%
introduce it to the committee
and

01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:57.659 --> 01:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
I am in a dilemma
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I think I know how it will end up
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
um my dilemma is that my preference
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
is the bill as it came to us from the
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
I've felt very strongly that not
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
doubting your intention in any way but
 
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:30.500 align:start position:0%
that your amendment was not
 
01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:32.290 align:start position:0%
that your amendment was not
appropriate

01:43:32.290 --> 01:43:32.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
primarily but not exclusively because of
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
section two
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
I have problems
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
with section one of your Amendment
 
01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.370 align:start position:0%
with section one of your Amendment
nonetheless

01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
what I proposed to do
 
01:43:53.209 --> 01:43:53.219 align:start position:0%
was recognizing that I don't live in a
 
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
perfect world
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
and that I am have never been part of
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
the my way or the highway group I have
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
always believed and compromise both
 
01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.310 align:start position:0%
always believed and compromise both
Within

01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
Within
 
01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
my political caucus but certainly
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
within the full body of the committee or
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:44:16.739 --> 01:44:19.070 align:start position:0%
the house
so

01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:22.450 --> 01:44:22.460 align:start position:0%
my dilemma is do I introduce it or not
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
and my conclusion is
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
because of my respect for the chair and
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
his intention and because of my
 
01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:34.189 align:start position:0%
his intention and because of my
commitment

01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
01:44:34.199 --> 01:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
commitment
to

01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.410 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
to compromise
 
01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.209 align:start position:0%
to compromise
uh

01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
with conflicting views that yes I will
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
present Amendment 1676.
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the committee I'm happy now to
 
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.790 align:start position:0%
to the committee I'm happy now to
officially

01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
officially
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
pass it out but I want to make clear to
 
01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:00.470 align:start position:0%
pass it out but I want to make clear to
everybody

01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.030 align:start position:0%
everybody
that

01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
I acknowledge that I personally believe
 
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
as it came to us from the Senate
 
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:14.540 align:start position:0%
is better than this
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
but I will not let the perfect be the
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
enemy of the less perfect so so if
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's a motion to introduce this bill I
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
I would second it
 
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
all right so so it's moved by
 
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and seconded by
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
oh Edward oh since I will second it then
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I will second oh an alternate
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
can second is that the rule I've I've
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
learned I've learned two things in the
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
last in the last five minutes I learned
 
01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:49.340 align:start position:0%
something the last few seconds okay
 
01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:52.199 align:start position:0%
and what's the motion chair what's the
 
01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
motion it's uh it's a motion to uh
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
otpa with uh representative Smith's
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's been moved and and seconded
 
01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.109 align:start position:0%
that's been moved and and seconded
um

01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith is there
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
anything further that you would like to
 
01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:17.870 align:start position:0%
anything further that you would like to
say

01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't I think I've made the
 
01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
I've made the point
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not happy with this but I don't
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
expect to be happy all the time
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
well I I guess what I what I what I
 
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
would say is that first of all I want to
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank I want to thank representative
 
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
Smith and I appreciate very much your
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
your sort of spirit of bipartisanship I
 
01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:41.780 align:start position:0%
know we have
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
differences among the committee members
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
I I guess as and I don't want to be
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
repeating myself and I apologize if I am
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
but I guess
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
my sense is that in the real world of
 
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
how how this amendment would operate
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
there aren't there aren't likely to be
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
very many circumstances in which
 
01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
if any of us were the judge
 
01:47:16.970 --> 01:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
we would disagree as to what should
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
happen in a particular case
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
um I guess I
 
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.149 align:start position:0%
um I guess I
um

01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know I agree that there will be many
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
cases as judge king pointed out where
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
where it'll be an easy decision to say
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
the person is Indigent and it will be uh
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
and it may well be an easy decision to
 
01:47:39.410 --> 01:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
say that the person doesn't have any
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
ability to repay but
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
there that's not all the cases and it
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
that somebody who can repay
 
01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
um even if it turns out to be on an
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
installment basis or whatever is somehow
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
gets a free ride where somebody who
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
is you know in the
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
it is retains brings their own counsel
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
with them to the hearing
 
01:48:11.159 --> 01:48:11.870 align:start position:0%
with them to the hearing
um

01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a free ride that just seems
 
01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
to me to be fundamentally unfair and so
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the basis upon which
 
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh I I propose uh I propose the
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and I I hope you'll support it
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
just for my clarification and
 
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
understanding is this motion to just
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
bring the amendment to admit and
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
consider or are we going to actually
 
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
01:48:45.470 --> 01:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith's Amendment now
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
we will we will be voting on
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's Amendment and
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
just again for for to make it absolutely
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
clear representative Smith's Amendment
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same as my Amendment
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
except that it there's no section two
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
there's my section two of my amendment
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
is is removed
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
do we have to consider your Amendment as
 
01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
first introduced before we consider hers
 
01:49:10.970 --> 01:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
no I withdrew my I withdrew my Amendment
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
so it was this it's only representative
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
Smithsonian thank you so I think unless
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
anybody else has any eye to comment I
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to call the roll
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so I'd ask the clerk to please uh
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
the motion then would be
 
01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
OTP a
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
and the first vote would be on the
 
01:49:47.159 --> 01:49:48.290 align:start position:0%
and the first vote would be on the
amendment

01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct that's correct so the
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
first vote will be on the amendment and
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%

report if you'd like but if you want to
 
01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:16.380 align:start position:0%

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:21.410 align:start position:0%

thank you very much even though I'm sure
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
that that is in any way more anyway
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
wanted but I appreciate your will
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
will there be a will there be
 
01:52:45.169 --> 01:52:45.179 align:start position:0%
will there be a Minority Report
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
when is it due it's literally due like
 
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
no yeah because I might it's got you got
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
to get it I you got to get it in like by
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
noon time literally because we this is a
 
01:52:59.450 --> 01:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
this is a fast track bill it's got to go
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
to finance
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
so if you want to write a Minority
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
Report you're fine I'm happy to have it
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hoping not to be the person who
 
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
writes a report but could the does the
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
alternative motion have to be itl or
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
could it just be OTP without the
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.169 --> 01:53:27.179 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you can you have somebody
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
you could I think you can say and there
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
in a Minority Report what you favor but
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
you got to have it you got to have it to
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
me by noontime that's you know so some
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
are you going to write a Minority Report
 
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
I was hoping to get out of it but uh
 
01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
well it's I I mean it doesn't have to be
 
01:53:44.689 --> 01:53:44.699 align:start position:0%
a Minority Report but if there's going
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
to be I'd like to know who's going to
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
I mean I could write it I could write a
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
simple one saying that the minority
 
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
believed that what the Senate sent over

01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
meeting and I'll send out when I think
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%

01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
an email to everybody and say Here's a
 
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
