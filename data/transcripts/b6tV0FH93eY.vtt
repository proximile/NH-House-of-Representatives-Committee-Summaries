legisl in cacr 22 we in the vo I believe
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
that there may be some confusion amongst
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
the Democratic members who showed up a
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
vote you've managed I think to really
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
destroy that how can we
 
00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:09.990 align:start position:0%
destroy that how can we
trust

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm just y i I understand
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
personally I'm personally offended but
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
also just as a group that's just not how
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
we have operated for two years I I
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
understand L I figured you and I would
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
speak after this and I will explain to
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
you my rationale behind it um it is
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
within the rules it was a notice
 
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
executive session I said cacr 22 from
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
the from the well it is per the rules I
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
believe it's Rule 13 um the the
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
executive session requires a majority
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
present and voting we waited until that
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
point and all we did was call for the
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider um anyways is there
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion of
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
pass yes represent representative Grill
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm getting DJ Vu but I think we
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
passed a cacr already this session uh we
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
did not pass a cacr already on this one
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
yet no I thought that was representative
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
Howard yeah so uh to to representative
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
Grill's Point uh one of the things that
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
we have discussed was statutory changes
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
that would give the Secretary of State
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
more flexibility as to how they could
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
set the primary date the problem in what
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
we've uh been discussing is yes I think
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room supports the
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
first in the nation presidential primary
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%
that's not a question what the debate is
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
and what the situation of putting the uh
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
date in the constitution is is that it
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
creates a completely rigid system that
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
does not create uh any flexibility in
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
how we can set the date so it kind of
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
leaves us in a situation where we could
 
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
be usurped uh and it would make it more
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to change when we can
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually hold our primary thank you
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the cacr
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
representative Lane as I recall when we
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
discussed this
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
before uh if by by Chance the uh cacr
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
pass then it puts the state in a very
 
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
awkward position of trying to continue
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
to be first in the nation so we would be
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
shooting ourselves in the foot if that's
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to do I understand
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you in the
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
past there has been bipartisan support
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
for our first in the nation primary and
 
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.350 align:start position:0%
for our first in the nation primary and
and

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
against a constitutional amendment for
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
something that is controlled by the
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
State to have this bill come up and be
 
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
acting in the way that this committee is
 
00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:49.870 align:start position:0%
acting in the way that this committee is
acting

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
acting
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
today is very strange to
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
me why we would want to put our voters
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
and our state in this position to take a
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
vote on a constitutional amendment that
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
very well could
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
fail and where does that leave the state
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
in defending our first in the nation
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
primary not one of us knows the outcome
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
of a vote on a constitutional amendment
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
for first in the nation primary it is a
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
very high bar to get a constitu
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment passed by voters who may not
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
feel as strongly as some of us feel
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
about the value in defending our first
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the nation
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
primary is this really a
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
risk that this committee wants to take
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
do you want to risk the losing the first
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
in the nation primary because that's
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
entirely possible if this were were to
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
go to the
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
voters you do not know the outcome of
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
this how much do you value our first in
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
primary are you willing to take this
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
risk I think in principle many of us
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
feel strongly in support of our first
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
the nation primary and do not want to
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
take that risk of losing it by a small
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
margin because that's all that it would
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
take to lose it a small margin to lose
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
it a huge High bar to secure the first
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
of the nation Primary in our
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
constitution our state law has been
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
doing just fine in defending our first
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
the nation primary our secretary of
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
state has
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
emphatically supported our first the
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
nation primary even when Party politics
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
have been at play from both parties
 
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
over the years New Hampshire has
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
defended our first than Nation primary
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
simply by following our state law to put
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
this in our constitution or to attempt
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
to put it in our constitution actually
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
does more harm to the history and the
 
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
tradition and the maintenance of our
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
first the nation
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
primary I'm very
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
concerned representative katad I think
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
it is a very important topic and I think
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
it should absolutely be left to the
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
voters to decide on and I think it is
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
bipartisan I mean it it did pass on the
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall unanimously so I
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
think that there's a lot of support for
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
this I think a lot of people want to see
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
us first in the nation a lot of
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
businesses really depend on our first in
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
the nation for renting out hotel rooms
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
and other things you know for their
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
economical survival really so I think
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's a really important thing that we
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
support this thank you
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
qualey I don't consider
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
putting a motion to the voters to be a
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
risk because I trust that the voters
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
will make the right decision
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
collectively in fact I think the will of
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
the voters will be by definition the
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
right decision thank
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
you any other member wish to comment who
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't commented yet representative
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislation for the primary came out of
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
Portsmith I feel I should say something
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'm not sure representative Spain
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
question let's say this passes is an
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
inin in the Constitution what do the
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%

threshold for passing a cacr on the
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
house floor a cacr is a three-fifth vote
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
of the those members present and voting
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%

to vote in favor I understand the
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
question the uh threshold to pass a
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%

the uh
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
financial burden of campaigning to pass
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
a cacr which tends to be an expensive
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to reach as many voters as
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
possible to reach that
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
threshold uh to encourage the passage of
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
aacr who who is financially responsible
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%

with that the motion of about to pass

report excuse me I'm Miss yes
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lane how how is it going
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
to be passed with no representation we
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
we reconsidered it we voted not to ought
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
to pass it so now we have to do
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
something else so we voted for we voted
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
against itl correct to reconsider we
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
voted to reconsider we voted against the
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
mo the the bill had originally been
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
voted 20 to Z inexpedient to legislate
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
correct correct so when we did the
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
reconsideration it went back to the the
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
prevailing motion which was inexpedient
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
to legislate we voted down in
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate down we just
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
voted did not vote up ought to pass so
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
it is now without recommendation EXC
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
motion oh there's a new motion okay yes
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to motion interim study
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay there's a motion from interim study
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
second second is there any discussion on
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
the motion of interim study yeah I'll
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to my motion uh so this is
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
something where putting the presidential
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
primary into the Constitution I think
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at a little bit more
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
in depth this is something where usually
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
we've approached this from a statutory
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh framework and that's worked out very
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
well our secretary of state has been
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
able to keep our presidential primary
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
for the last 100 years it's something
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
where we are able to update it and
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
maintain uh the presidential primary
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
requirements as necessary and easily
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
through the uh statutory means because
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
we don't need to go back to the voters
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
every single time we want to make a
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
change we don't necessarily know what
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
the impact of putting this in the
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
constitution is going to be are other
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
states going to listen to the New
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution do we have
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over them I think not and
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
these are questions that I think need to
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
be answered before we go and actually
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
vote on adding this into the
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution I think that we all support
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
the presidential uh primary and the
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
first in the nation I do I I voted for
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
the statutory changes but this is
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
something where we're not necessarily
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the first in the nation
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
primary when we're talking about the
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
issues with the legislation the
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
potential issues and that's why I think
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
that we need to study this a bit further
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
