00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
good morning it is June 13th welcome to
 
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
a special committee on housing
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start the day by asking
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy to lead us in the
 
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.010 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy to lead us in the
pledge

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
um so a couple housekeeping items
 
00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.070 align:start position:0%
um so a couple housekeeping items
Christine

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
Christine
 
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
um grant our researcher has put together
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
two memos for us one is issues regarding
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
housing so
 
00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 align:start position:0%
um she's outlined kind of a a a surface
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
level or a aerial level view of
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
um what's going on in the state and then
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
another memo I have specifically asked
 
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
Miss Grant to put together which um
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
discusses impact fees what Municipal
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
what municipalities charge
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
and what they're used for so um that'll
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
kind of give us a good idea and this
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
kind of dovetails into our 10 AM guest
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
um Rainey Pelletier from New Hampshire
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
just turn it back on
 
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
perfect nope there you go we're good oh
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
good jeez
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for the invite and I I think
 
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
as I understand my goal is to kind of go
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
through the processes for how Des
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
handles development uh from the
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
beginning to the end of the project yes
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
and I'll start out with saying let's say
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
that you're an individual that has a
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
bulk possible land and you want it to
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
create a number of lots however it could
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
be two lots could be 20 Lots could be 30
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
Lots so you would initially come into
 
00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:14.419 align:start position:0%
the department for a subsurface
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
subdivision requirement and what that is
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
based on is when you create a given lot
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's all based on its ability to handle
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
on-site Wastewater and Wells
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
so in the initial phase of creating
 
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
those lots you would have to do a soil
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
analysis see how much Wastewater the lot
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
could support and that would what that
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
would dictate the size of the lots that
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
will ultimately be approved so once you
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
get through that process you would then
 
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
come in for once again it'll be based on
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
a soil test bit looking at what type of
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
soil you have and that'll determine how
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
many bedrooms you can have historically
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
a new subdivision we approve can handle
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
a four bedroom house
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
um where we get interesting is when you
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
look at older Lots or lots of record
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
that were done prior at the 1967. uh
 
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
generally a lot of those can't handle a
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
large Wastewater and on site with a well
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
so as a minimum we would approve a
 
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom house
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
so as that process goes through you move
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
on to the next phase assuming you've got
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
what we call a construction to install a
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
septic system on site
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
once that happens that process begins
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
you hire a licensed installer and a
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
licensed designer to design that system
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
we then in fact inspect the system and
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
if it passes the design criteria then
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
you would get an operational approval
 
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
and you're good to go from my
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
perspective what the town has for
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
regulations is something that we don't
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
regulate or dictate so if they have more
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
stringent regulations than any of our
 
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.190 align:start position:0%
stringent regulations than any of our
regulations

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily they have a right to do that
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
so let's say now that you've created a
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
subdivision you've got a lot and now
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're in a protected Shoreland Zone
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
which is the mean high water mark the
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
250 feet
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
if in fact you're going to have an
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
impact on that particular site then you
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
would need a sure land permit
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay and that sureland permit controls
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
what happens in the first 20 feet the
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
first 50 feet or the back to the 250
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
feet of that particular parcel
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
once that permit is achieved you've got
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
your operational approval for a septic
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
now you can construct whatever you
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
choose to put on that site
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
now let's say that you've got a larger
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
subdivision and you've got 2 000 feet of
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
road or more
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
then you would have to come in for what
 
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
we call an alteration of terrain permit
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
and what that does is to make sure that
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
when you in fact you develop a property
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
that the storm water is controlled so it
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't go off-site going to a river
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
lake yada yada yada or neighbor's
 
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
property so if that's the case you'd
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
come in if you're impacting fifty
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet or more and it's
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
generally lineal on a road in the
 
00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
Shoreland you would need an aot permit
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you're not in the Shoreland Zone
 
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
you're impacting 1 000 square feet which
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
is basically 200 linear feet of road
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
then you would need an alteration permit
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
so when those things are all achieved
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
so what local zoning requires there are
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
some towns matter of fact I just had a
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
phone call the other day and on a Town
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
Sutton has like a five acre minimum uh
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
that again they allowed any municipality
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
or entity is allowed to be more
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
stringent than the state rules and laws
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
but can't be any less stringent so a lot
 
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
of what happens within the state uh lot
 
00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:19.339 align:start position:0%
sizes in particular may be
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
addressed by the town once you get
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
through their process then you have to
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
come in to our programs
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
um so to start it off you you're saying
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
that a developer will go through the
 
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
town first and then generally if it's
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
going to be a large subdivision
 
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.170 align:start position:0%
going to be a large subdivision
absolutely

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
they will go in and get it proved
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
locally otherwise they submit a plan to
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
us let's say that we permitted it they
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
had more stringent requirements then
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
they got to come back with an amended
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
plan so it's prudent for a consultant to
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
get through the town process first and
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
then submit to us there's also a
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority for towns to require
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
that they prove they approve an on-site
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
septic system prior to it being
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
submitted to us so there are several of
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
those I think 49 communities that
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
require that you get your design for a
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
septic system approved locally before we
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
can review it and and take an
 
00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
can review it and and take an
application

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
other questions from Serene
 
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.170 align:start position:0%
other questions from Serene
representative

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
 
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:29.930 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
question

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you said that
 
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:35.660 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things normally that you
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
approve a four bedroom
 
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.530 align:start position:0%
approve a four bedroom
um

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
system for Waste Water
 
00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:44.090 align:start position:0%
system for Waste Water
um

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
are there are there
 
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.990 align:start position:0%
are there are there
um

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
different types of systems that that may
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
able to use less or more land and is
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
that taken into uh if so is that taken
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
into effect account when you're saying
 
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.150 align:start position:0%
into effect account when you're saying
like

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
um how many Lots you can have do you say
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
like if you go with this kind of system
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
that only takes up this amount of room
 
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
then you can do this many lots and if
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
you do this system you can do more Lots
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
or less Lots good question thank you no
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
I think when you look at the basic
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
overall design whether it be it to
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
subdivisional level or the individual
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
lot size based on the soil type on that
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
lot it can only treat a certain amount
 
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
of gallons per day of waste water we do
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
have a program where where we approve
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
Innovative Technologies and what that
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
does is it looks at this the height to
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
seasonal high water on that particular
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
soil type and may need a smaller
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
leaching area but it has no effect on
 
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
what that lot can handle from a
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
Wastewater load so whatever technology
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
you want to use is it's all based on
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
let's say you got an acre of land on
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
your site you need to put an on lot well
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that radius which is 75 feet has to
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
be subtracted out of that area then you
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
look at the soil type let's take a if
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's the best case scenario group one
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
soil then you probably would be able to
 
00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:18.139 align:start position:0%
get a three or four bedroom house
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the technology you used
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
that may reduce the footprint of that
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
system but it won't generate any more
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking this
 
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.610 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking this
follow-up

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.290 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:35.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
what are you are you basing the uh
 
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:44.420 align:start position:0%
uh the number of gallons because
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
nowadays people are using much more high
 
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.110 align:start position:0%
nowadays people are using much more high
efficiency

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
types of appliances or if someone was
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do like a low impact
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
setup then they might you know be
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
actually shooting for a lot less water
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
throughput through their property than
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
maybe the um the department normally
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
would consider for a generic house does
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
any of that come into
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
um a pla play like if they if they were
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
planning on
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe the department says
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to estimate 75 gallons per
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
person per you know day or whatever and
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're actually going to be
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
implementing you know measures that
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
would reduce that to you know 25 gallons
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
a day would that impact or would the
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
department be able to take into account
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
that those Innovative uh yeah thanks
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question well when you
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at and I left representative Alec
 
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
Alexander a copy of a 1 000 rules there
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
are multiple ways that you calculate the
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
amount of loading that would be expected
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
to be on a site if it's a rep dwelling a
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
four bedroom house it's 150 gallons per
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
bedroom per day where we've gotten the
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
problems over the past years is people
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
will come in they claim they're going to
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
put in water Savers or whatever but it
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't accommodate larger groups on a
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
weekend that doesn't control how many
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
people are in a bedroom so it's a
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
conservative number the 150 gallons per
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
day per bedroom now if you're getting
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
commercial establishment it may be based
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
on a number of seats it could be based
 
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
on the number of servings that you have
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
are you serving on paper are you serving
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
on China that's going to be a difference
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
of how that Wastewater load is
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
calculated we have been in situations
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
where lots have been serviced by an
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
awful lot water supply a municipal let's
 
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
say is a good example and you have
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
metered flows for the last year to show
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
us how much actual use has gone into
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
that property or in a property very
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
similar then we would entertain looking
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
at that kind of waste flow generated but
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
answer your question at the the end of
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
the day the basic premises if you're
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
building a residential dwelling it's 150
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
gallons per day we cannot control the
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
type of structures that are in the
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
building we can't control a number of
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
people that are actually in a bedroom so
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
we continue to use the conservative
 
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
number of 150 gallons per day that has
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
been in place since I've been at the
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.690 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
is do you know if that 150 gallons per
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
day is in statute or in rules
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.450 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
can you so I live on on a property that
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
that um doesn't have a leech field I
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
only have
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
um uh holding tank and
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
um my holding tank is a thousand gallons
 
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:04.220 align:start position:0%
and based on the the uh
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
the Department's estimate I must be
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
pumping my my tank every like week but
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
um absurd I would never do that it would
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
be way too expensive so obviously I
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
definitely control what water goes down
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
into that very stringently
 
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
into that very stringently
um

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
the I guess can you
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
talk about the holding tank idea and and
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
how how receptive is
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
um the department to that
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
um type of setup understanding that none
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
of the waste unless I actually allow it
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
to fail
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and overflow would be going anywhere
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and so then uh you know the size of
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
my lot could be the size of the
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
Wastewater holding tank because there's
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
no no actual leaching actually happening
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
on my property yeah you talk about that
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
oh sure so if you've got a lot of record
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
or a lot that's existed for a lot of
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
years and obviously you don't have these
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
square footage of that lot to put an
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
on-site Wastewater we would permit a
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
holding tank
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
for any new construction if it were a
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
pre-67 lot we would approve a
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom maximum house on that lot
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
now keep in mind that holding tanks The
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
Tipping fees for holding tank pumpings
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
today is somewhere around 400 so it's
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
not cheap and it's not going to get
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
cheaper because of Wastewater plants
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
that get problems just getting rid of
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
their bio cells at the end of that
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
treatment process but so to answer your
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
question we would not permit a holding
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
tank for any new construction over the
 
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.010 align:start position:0%
tank for any new construction over the
years

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.020 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
by rule you're supposed to keep track of
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
your pumping receipts to see that you in
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
fact are pumping that tank we do approve
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
holding tanks when there's no other
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
alternative on a site
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we've had over the
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
years is after about a year or two and
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
and this isn't you I'm sure but after a
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
year or two it's very interesting that
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
the outlet of that tank has been
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
compromised and so what happens there's
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
no pumping
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
because the Wastewater is going out over
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
the edge so it's something that we can't
 
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.430 align:start position:0%
the edge so it's something that we can't
control

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
um it's depending on the situation the
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
people what's the cost let's say that
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
people weren't as smart as you
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
apparently have been and minimized their
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
waste water flows that you know if
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
they've got a large family let's say
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
let's say they get three two or three
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
kids they get a holding tank they don't
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
have any other option that's going to be
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
probably a four or five hundred dollar
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly treatment unless they really
 
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
look at how they can control a
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
Wastewater discharge so holding tanks or
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
Last Resort and that's the only time
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
that we would permit them
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
you didn't really address the 150 is it
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
in statutory and rules that you guys set
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
that in rule okay thank you
 
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
and you if I might yeah I left
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander a copy of the
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
1000 rules it's got all of the flow
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
rates that would be expected to be
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
generated by a particular structure and
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
that may in fact help you representative
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
you cooler to see where how that changes
 
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
okay representative Damon are you sure
 
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.370 align:start position:0%
okay representative Damon are you sure
I'm

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
sure thank you if I might
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
um those rules are actually on our
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
um Talons thank you
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
compare with national standards or
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
standards in other states
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
I I think we're probably a little more
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
conservative but it's tough to tell
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
because when you get out of New England
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
you go all over the country the soils
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
are dramatically different so the bottom
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
concept of any Wastewater load is based
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
on the soil type and how effective it is
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
in treating that Wastewater so it's
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
tough to draw a comparison by any of the
 
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
other states in the country unless you
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
have a good handle on what their soil
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
profiles are and what the expectations
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
of treating the Wastewater adequately
 
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.130 align:start position:0%
of treating the Wastewater adequately
are

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.770 align:start position:0%
 
error

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:41.780 align:start position:0%
error
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
widely Divergent soil types I mean if
 
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.529 align:start position:0%
widely Divergent soil types I mean if
you're

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
Coastal Seacoast Sandy whatever I'm in
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
The Lakes Region we're all granite or
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
mostly Granite so
 
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:55.940 align:start position:0%
could there potentially be room for
 
00:24:00.169 --> 00:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
researching a more flexible standard
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
well I I we were never shy away from
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
researching but as you well know if you
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
look at our budgets we have never had
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
the ability to have an r d program in
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
the section now the soil profiles
 
00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:17.059 align:start position:0%
they've been in place for a long time
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of it was based on the
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
soil the ability of soil scientists back
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
in the old days to look at a system and
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
determine what soil type was adequate to
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
treat a certain amount of waste water
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's generated I mean there's always
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
room to look at Innovative Technologies
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
and so but you're talking at a costly
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
event to determine that but if that
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
money were available it certainly
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify in response to
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
one of Representative callus questions
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there has not been any uh
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
adjustment or flexibility in regards to
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
different water output like a
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
development could
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
have all low flow toilets have
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
um conservative washers etc etc there
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
hasn't been any adjustment in regards to
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
that no because that's one of those
 
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
things you can't control you know over
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
the years we used to consider a
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
reduction for compost oil it's a
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
gas-fired toilets many years after that
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
people would use those types of
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
facilities in shortly after they'd be
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
ripped out and they'd put in a flush
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
toilet so I mean the alternatives to a
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
regular flush toilet depending on
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's two liters a day and in the
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
old days it was like two gallons a day
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
as you well know and so the issue is is
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's been many people that have
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
looked at Alternatives but after they
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
have to maintain them and use them they
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Pelletier and it's
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful to have you here
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
if I understand your function or you
 
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
also oversee drinking water that's
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay so I'd like to start there
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
if I could so drinking water
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh on a large subdivision right now and
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
citing a well getting you you have to
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
start with the developer has to get
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
permission from the state to put a well
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
in where the well is going to be and so
 
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:40.460 align:start position:0%
forth no issue with that the problem is
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
that it can routinely take up to a year
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
to get through that process on a longer
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision how do we streamline that I
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
understand I understand Staffing is an
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
issue in people working but that's
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
that's a huge hindrance for development
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
so how can we streamline that that's a
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
good question thanks well I think one of
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
the issues that if it's smaller than 20
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
gallons per day or 40 gallons per day
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
then you don't need to go through the
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawal now under
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirement for a large
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal which would be
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
over 40 gallons per minute then in fact
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
there's a Litany of issues that you have
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
to go through hydrogeologically to see
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
if in fact that well is going to be
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
productive number one number two will it
 
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:30.140 align:start position:0%
impact any wells around that given area
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
so the timing is more a constraint
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's created on the on the process to
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
afford the right that you have the
 
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
protective well radius that's not going
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
to affect adjacent properties so at the
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
end of the day if you get a large water
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
withdrawal which we don't see many
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
anymore just because of the cost you
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
know to do a large groundwater
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawal to pay a consultant or a
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist you're probably looking
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
at a hundred thousand probably 150.
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
in the old days we used to see a lot of
 
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
what representative McConkey is talking
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
about Community Wells and what the
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
benefit of that was is that because it
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
was located in one central location the
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
developer could create smaller lots and
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
that was the whole premise Behind These
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
Community Water Systems as time has
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
progressed the the requirements the
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
federal requirements of the Safe
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Act have put in so much
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
testing requirements and even today
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
you've all heard the boutique contamina
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
now pfas P4 a lot of people are
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
concerned about that if they've got a
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
community well then what's the cost of
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
treating it if you've got high arsenic
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
you got high manganese what's the cost
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
of treating it so most people now when
 
00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
we look at new subdivisions are looking
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
for on-site Wastewater so if there is a
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
cost associated with treatment then it
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
will be borne by the individual lot only
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
not by a homeowners association so the
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
long and the short that's a long answer
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
to a short question is that I don't see
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
that process sharding up I don't believe
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
it's our review time that's holding that
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
up that what's taking the year to get a
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawal is hiring a
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
consultant to do the work
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
if I could so
 
00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:30.059 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll come back to that so there
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
was a common practice for developers and
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
you would you had struck a chord on the
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
amount of testing and annual uh process
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
required for Community system we're
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
putting uh multiple Wells on one lot
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
and servicing each well not servicing
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
more than what nine units or ten units a
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
piece and then but then all of a sudden
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
the department and I don't believe it
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
was the Feds all of a sudden the
 
00:29:59.570 --> 00:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
department started saying that when you
 
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
have three of those wells in one lot
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
then that bumps that up to become a
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
higher standard and I I believe that was
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
done by the department not done by the
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
feds and I'd like to see that return can
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
you comment on that yeah I think when
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
whenever you look at it you've got a
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
given well radius as you well know Wells
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
have a Zona contribution
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
so people would for years try and get
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
away from the lodge or groundwater
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
withdrawal permitting requirements by
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
placing free welds to come under the
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
Department's review of a public water
 
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
system you need 15 or more service
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
connections so what people were trying
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
to do was avoid that regulation and put
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
three different Wells assuming they were
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
based on nine units per day when we got
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
a Department of Justice opinion on that
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
that was just a way to try and get
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
around the standard so if you if you're
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
going to develop a community system and
 
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
you choose to put in three Wells and you
 
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
may need to because one well may only
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
get two gallons a minute one well maybe
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
a hundred gallons per minute in Bedrock
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's pretty unusual so the answer
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey's question you
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
know under the guise of putting three
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
wells in one particular site to beat the
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
system was decided by the Department of
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
Justice that that's considered as one
 
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.889 align:start position:0%
Justice that that's considered as one
load

00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
load
 
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you for that as unaware of
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice ruling if you
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
could provide that to the chairman I'd
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate it under that
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
regulation two Wells on one lot is still
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
permissible which would be 18 units on
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
on one lot
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
excuse me on 18 units housing units
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
on two Wells
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
are you saying if they're in the same
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
site if the the same site then that in
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
fact is another approach to try and get
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
around the approval process I I'm not so
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
worried about getting around our our
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
mission is how can we streamline how can
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
we make development a more reasonable
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
cost with precautions so everyone comes
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
to us and I'm sorry am I okay to
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
continue so everyone comes to us as a
 
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
developer if you don't have Town
 
00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
Watertown sewer we're not going to talk
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
to you so what 75 80 percent of our our
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
sep our septic systems are on private
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
land so how can we make those those
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
processes happen and I I would I would
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
think that you might be willing to have
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
a further conversation on on maybe some
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
of those water issues at another time
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
septic systems and I certainly share Mrs
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
pelletier's point on holding tanks it's
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's a last resort and they mysteriously
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
always find a way to uh to leech out so
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
good people uh unfortunately going
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
forward don't have that ability to use
 
00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:09.470 align:start position:0%
forward don't have that ability to use
them

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
um we have for longer than you and I
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
have been involved in this
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
um Stone and pipe has been the Mainstay
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire septic systems
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
but and then there was an evolution of
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
plastic products that came along whether
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
it be Enviro or infiltrator and so forth
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
and when they came along with some
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
research it was developed they showed
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
that uh unlike a stone and pipe system
 
00:33:44.529 --> 00:33:44.539 align:start position:0%
they could have a much smaller footprint
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
and if it was a new system they no
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
longer had to be four feet above
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
seasonal high water and I'm sorry if I
 
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
lose some in the weeds they could get
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
down to 24 inches under X number of
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
gallons a day and then to 30 inches
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
when a septic system fails in in our
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
state the new standard
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
comes in that all septic systems now can
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
be 24 inches to 30 inches above seasonal
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
High Water by loading
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
I would suggest it's time and I
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
understand that you're going through
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
rules at this point in time that the
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
department adopt as soon as possible
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
permitting Stone and pipe to have a 24
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
inch to seasonal high water perhaps with
 
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
a six inch sand bed which other states
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
do and or 30 above a thousand gallons
 
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
and the reason and I know you're looking
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
into this the reason for the thousand
 
00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:46.070 align:start position:0%
into this the reason for the thousand
gallon

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
um threshold per system is because
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
nitrates and phosphates are generated
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
now I have to keep each field so far
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
apart but if we stay under a thousand
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
gallons a lot of those regulations I
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
think it's time that it's done and it
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
can be done I'm hoping
 
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.050 align:start position:0%
can be done I'm hoping
um

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
it can be done in your new rules in
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
whatever this committee could do towards
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
that again I would like a further
 
00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.510 align:start position:0%
that again I would like a further
conversation

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.370 align:start position:0%
conversation
the

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh so a stone and pipe for less than a
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
thousand gallons a day
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
would handle
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
um what a four or four unit
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
um house four bedrooms
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
uh going into that it would become
 
00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:37.460 align:start position:0%
efficient for a condo a duplex
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
multiple Fields placed around would
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
would you agree with my first premise on
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
that and is that something that might
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
happen in your newest uh rules yeah I'm
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
not sure it's going to happen in new
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
rules but I I couldn't agree with you
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
more I think for years the technologies
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
that we've looked at and I'll go back to
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
the early years of just drink drinking
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
water treatment we know historically
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
that the sand under the bottom of the
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
bed or the original soil depending on
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
the soil type is carrying the load for
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
treatment so I would agree with you that
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
at this point in time it's time for us
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
to get through the
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
the change to include Stone and pipe
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
depending on if you have six inches of
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
sand underneath it because that's
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
carrying the load the sand as you well
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
know is what's treating it if you've got
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
a native soil that's effective in
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
treating then we don't worry so much
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
about six inches of sand the Innovative
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
Technologies that have come about over
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
the years Embrace of on testing as you
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
know they test in the mass
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
testing center to look at how effective
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
it is to a conventional system and
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
because number one maybe there's a lot
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
more air that moves through it which it
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
makes the bacteria aerobic instead of
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
anaerobic the digestion is much quicker
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
and much more thorough
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
with stone and and pipe I think back in
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
the old days we always used to have a
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
vent on one end of the other to move air
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
through you know aerobic digestion is so
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
much more efficient than anaerobic
 
00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:17.099 align:start position:0%
so I would agree with you that I think
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's time that we try and take some time
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
and sit down and look at
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
giving the same benefits to Stone and
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
pipe I see a lot of people going back to
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
Stone and pipe a lot of people on having
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
good luck with the Innovative
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
Technologies for whatever reason whether
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
it be bed preparation or the type of
 
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339 align:start position:0%
sand or you know pick a topic any topic
 
00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:39.589 align:start position:0%
sand or you know pick a topic any topic
but

00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I would not shy away from that
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good thought
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to let you go
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
but it seems like
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
um you were the committee should put
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
together suggestions on rule changes for
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
Des and that could be part of our
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you keep going one
 
00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.250 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you keep going one
final

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.930 align:start position:0%
final
so

00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
um being in being in the industry
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and talking about some of the
 
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
Innovative products and they may not be
 
00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
lasting as long and one of the
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
advantages of stone and pipe was the
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
large voids the large side of the field
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
taking care of perk rates and so forth I
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
I see on a regular basis phone calls at
 
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
least two to three times a week failed
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
septic systems I just bought the house I
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
didn't take the time to do a inspection
 
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
and now I'm facing a twenty thousand
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollar liability yep every day of the
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
week talking consoling people and so
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
forth so I'm I'm wondering if we as a
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee could keep an eye on uh
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
questions coming back uh talking about
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
for developers if if they were to be
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
permitted to use common Wells and so
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
forth and they were to put their their
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
subdivision smaller subdivisions or
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
groups of subdivisions
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
using condo regulations so that there
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
was a common fund that stayed in place
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
for Replacements and maintenance of
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
septics if that would be uh possibly a
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
good idea also
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
well I think you know if you look at to
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
me one of the biggest problems we have
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
whether it be water or Wastewater is
 
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations it is tough to
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
get everybody on the same page
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
especially if they're looking at a 20
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
000 or 30 or 40 000 price tag you know
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm dealing with one right now and
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
bottle it big issue half of the
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners understand they need to do
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
well the other half don't want to pay
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
for it so
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
historically I think one of the cleaner
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
ways to do this is there ought to be a
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement when people file
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
condo agreements with the secretary of
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
state that they in fact have to create a
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
contingency fund so when something goes
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
awry whether it be on the water side of
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater side that people aren't
 
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
fighting because now all of a sudden
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
they're HOAs go up from 150 a month to
 
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.190 align:start position:0%
they're HOAs go up from 150 a month to
500.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
500.
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
you know and I think so you raise a good
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
point I I think historically in my
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
career homeowners associations for the
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
Lion's Share are a problem
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
um because you get new people to buy in
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
they're not diligent you know I would
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
like to see if something made a lot of
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
sense that it would be a statutory
 
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.020 align:start position:0%
requirement that when a property is sold
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about disclosure
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
then it ought to be required to have a
 
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
licensed designer
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
inspect the system to see if in fact
 
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's viable
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
you know what happens today is you know
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
Mark many people
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
just want to get in and buy they're not
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
diligent we see it with docs we see it
 
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
with breakwaters we see with septic
 
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
systems we see it with welds that get a
 
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
half a gallon a minute people come in
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
they get five kids that welds can't
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
support it so you know I think on the
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
real estate side or transfer side there
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
ought to be a lot more requirements that
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
diligence is followed you know so people
 
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
are not buying a pig in a poke
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Pelletier and thank you for
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
the Indulgence committee
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah we've seen over the
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
last few years a big problem people
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
buying without inspections a huge
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
problem and very closely
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
but a follow-up to what we just talked
 
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.650 align:start position:0%
but a follow-up to what we just talked
about

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
if we're in an association and say I
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
want to buy a unit in the association
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
an engineer take a look at the system to
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
make sure that that system is good or
 
00:42:00.609 --> 00:42:00.619 align:start position:0%
the you know the tie-ins are there and
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
what's on my property is it's good okay
 
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
is that what you meant just just the
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
part that I'm purchasing well depending
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
on there is is we've just talked about
 
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
there are multiple ways that homeowners
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
get involved some have homeowner
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
associations for road maintenance
 
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
rubbish removal
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
but may have on-site on lot septic
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
systems there are those homeowner
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
associations that have a community
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
system where they may have a leech feel
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
it handles the Wastewater load from five
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
units and then the next five units have
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
a field somewhere else on that property
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
so depending on the Comfort level one
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
would have of buying a piece of property
 
00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:47.410 align:start position:0%
would have of buying a piece of property
in

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:47.420 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
on-site is pretty straightforward you
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
know if I'm going to spend half a
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars to buy a private lot on
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
light septic I mean I don't I want to go
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
in with eyes wide open you know so
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
what's the report they may go in and
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
have a well now as you well know one of
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
the common contaminants today is arsenic
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know there are some people that
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
don't believe in treatment they got
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
arsenic they'll drink it or they get
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
some one spout potable water where they
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
treat it somebody comes in with a larger
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
family and all of a sudden they choose
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
to test their water which a lot of
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
people don't do today and they find out
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
yikes my arsenics well above the
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
standard well now they could be in for
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar ticket to treat that
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
arsenic because they don't want to drink
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
it whereas it may not have been an issue
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
for the previous owner so there are a
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
lot of nuances that come up when you buy
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
a piece of property whether it be in a
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
homeowner association or just the
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
private house on a given lot in your
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
particular town so
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
the recommended issue here is one has to
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
be diligent there are two key paths to a
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
shot of the lead-based paint and all the
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
other stuff but from the environmental
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
side on our side on the water side there
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
are two key components that cut could
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
cost one a lot of money that would be
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
waste water like representative McConkey
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
said septic systems today are costing
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 20 grand 25 grand for a
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
four bedroom house you know if you go in
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
your system fails because you weren't
 
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
diligent you didn't have it inspected
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
then that's on you
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
you go in and you don't test you have
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
your water tested for parameters that
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
are concerned whether it be nitrogen
 
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
whether it be manganese whether it be
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
arsenic then that's on you so those are
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
the things that can go awry and when we
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
get people to call up and they're beside
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
themselves you know and we have no
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
recourse you know if they bought
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
something in weren't diligent about
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
doing an evaluation of what they were
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
actually buying that there's nothing we
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman there's a
 
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I'm if I'm going to buy a
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
property and I I have to have my water
 
00:45:11.339 --> 00:45:12.770 align:start position:0%
property and I I have to have my water
tested

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
tested
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
and say there's five people on the well
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
and then my neighbor wants to sell his
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
house my neighbor's going to have to
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
have it tested
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
should the association
 
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
should the association
um

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
take my my test and hold it and it's
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
good for a certain period of time you
 
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
good for a certain period of time you
think

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
for the five units
 
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
for the five units
or

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
we're an Uncharted Territory so tell me
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
what you think
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
um but if I'm going to pay for a test
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
why should you have to pay for a test no
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
and if it's a community well and that's
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
a small community well and I wouldn't
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
even call it 20 units that well is not
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
regulated by us so if in fact it's five
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
units and it's not in the public
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
drinking water program if you were smart
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
and diligent went out and took a test I
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
would think if somebody else came in
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
bought a next unit if the if there is an
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
association for this five unit cluster
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
or whatever it might be then that should
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
be a valid water sample
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know but I would say water
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
especially in Bedrock Wells over years
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
is demand increases the the constituents
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
may change so it's not a bad thing where
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
every year or two that you should
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
certainly check it but anyone that buys
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
a structure of any kind that does not
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
look and see what their water quality is
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
or their well
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
is not good
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
um anybody else representing Keller
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
hi thank you
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
um so you talked a little bit about the
 
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.970 align:start position:0%
um so you talked a little bit about the
Innovative

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
Innovative
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
um Technologies for septic
 
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.170 align:start position:0%
um Technologies for septic
um

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.210 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm interested in how
 
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.089 align:start position:0%
I I'm interested in how
um

00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:02.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
um I guess uh complicated that process
 
00:47:06.839 --> 00:47:08.450 align:start position:0%
um I guess uh complicated that process
is

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
um for the you know the person that does
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
it the first time for this type of
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
system and then how does that Innovative
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
technology like
 
00:47:18.839 --> 00:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
technology like
um

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
like I guess proof to the department get
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
turned into just the standard
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
um like we've we've looked at this
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
before we don't have to look at it every
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
time for an Innovative technology we've
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
looked at this technology before so it's
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
no longer Innovative it's just
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh technology that is you know that we
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
have rules for I guess set up yeah good
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
question I think when we approve an
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
Innovative technology that is approved
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity unless we see over a trend
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
that let's say over a year or two we see
 
00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
a massive amount of failures then we
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
would re-evaluate that technology and
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
try and find out but let's say we
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
approve system X as an Innovative
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
technology that's approved so if you
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
used it and then two years later
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
somebody down the road wants to use it
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
that's an approved technology we don't
 
00:48:17.089 --> 00:48:17.099 align:start position:0%
have to revisit it again the only time
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
we revisit Innovative Technologies that
 
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:23.780 align:start position:0%
we approve is if in fact we see an
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
anomaly in a number of failures so we
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
would then talk to the distributor or
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
the owner of that technology and say hey
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
what's the problem
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on but once it's
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I like to follow up um the
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
with these Innovative Technologies are
 
00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:45.470 align:start position:0%
with these Innovative Technologies are
you

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.730 align:start position:0%
you
um

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
are you calculating
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
like Effectiveness versus the
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
other Technologies and how much water or
 
00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
other Technologies and how much water or
or

00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
treatment they can actually produce and
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
therefore you know uh this size of
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
system is going to be able to treat four
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
houses and the four houses approved the
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
Eight houses approved at this you know
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
load et cetera et cetera
 
00:49:12.359 --> 00:49:13.010 align:start position:0%
load et cetera et cetera
um

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
and and how well is that
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
um you know available to the public
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
about what things are approved what
 
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
options do they have versus
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
um or is that kind of incumbent on the
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
engineer to tell them or well I think
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
first of all as you may or may not know
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
all septic systems in New Hampshire
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
whether they're new failed Replacements
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
have to be submitted to the department
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
by a licensed designer that over the
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
years has been a great program because
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
there those people are well educated on
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
soil they know what they're looking at
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
and they can get in and get a design
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
whenever we approve an Innovative
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
technology that comes with books of
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
testing this done out of the mass
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
testing center in Massachusetts where
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
they can pair a new technology to a
 
00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:05.339 align:start position:0%
stone and pipe system see what the
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of treatment is and that
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
in fact will dictate their height to
 
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
seasonal high water table depending on
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
the soil and also the amount of area
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
necessary to treat the appropriate waste
 
00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
water load that's going to go there so
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
they may vary based on what the and I'm
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
talking a lot of testing to see what
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
kind of Effectiveness they are what kind
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
of area is necessary what kind of height
 
00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
above seasonal high water table will in
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
fact adequately tweet treat whatever
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
Wastewater is going to be generated for
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
that particular utility so they may vary
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
in square footage or what area you need
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
but it would all be based and premised
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
on what the testing looked like and how
 
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective was it in
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so so with these books of data
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
um that sounds expensive to get a new uh
 
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:09.020 align:start position:0%
Innovative uh
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
technology approved
 
00:51:12.119 --> 00:51:13.549 align:start position:0%
technology approved
um

00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:17.030 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
do we have to do our own
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
um you said like Boston or Massachusetts
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
or something is doing the testing or is
 
00:51:25.619 --> 00:51:26.510 align:start position:0%
or something is doing the testing or is
that

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
um is like
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
let's say a new technology goes to
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
Boston they say I want to get approved
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
they give them all this data and they
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
say here's here test this can is that
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
that single place able to like approve
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
and show the data and then like many
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
states accept that that data so that
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
they can approve them or
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
um are we saying no we have to get our
 
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:55.740 align:start position:0%
own testing requirements for for that
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
yeah no we have parameters that we
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
expect to see in the testing program and
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
the mass testing center has that data so
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
they will compare this Innovative
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
technology to Stone and pipe basically
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
is what they do those reams of testing
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
the parameters that are done they will
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
submit that data or the applicant that
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
wants us to approve their technology
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
we'll submit the results of that data
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
and if the numbers we don't re-evaluate
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
it again if this is what that testing
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
center tells us and they're very good at
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
what they do then in fact we would base
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
our Innovative permit on the data that
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
all right I have a couple questions
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
do you need to go again okay just
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
um how many
 
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.970 align:start position:0%
um how many
uh

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh Innovative Technologies are getting
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
approved like um is it like one a year
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
one every five years one every ten years
 
00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.700 align:start position:0%
one every 15 years
 
00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
depends on the given year sometimes it
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
may be one or two a year and then we may
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
not see a new technology coming in for
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know it it basically is based on the
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship of what people want to
 
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.329 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship of what people want to
do

00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay to um piggyback off that do you
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
when when a technology is approved do
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
you go through all the administrative
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
rules and try to update them depending
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
on new technology in the field yeah we
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
will when when it comes in we will in
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
fact post on the website technologies
 
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.420 align:start position:0%
that are viable to be permitted by a
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
licensed designer okay and if the
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
easier for would the technology make it
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
so that you're able to LAX up on the
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
rules a little bit like make them less
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
stringent maybe with new technology
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm wondering is like how
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
often are these rules looked at and
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
Revisited depending on like developments
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the field what we look at is when
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in with an Innovative
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
technology that we've approved then we
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
don't have to update the rules that you
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
can submit a licensed designer will
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
submit it they know we've approved the
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
technology we will look at the
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
parameters that were that approval was
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
based on and move you through the
 
00:54:14.099 --> 00:54:15.049 align:start position:0%
based on and move you through the
process

00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
and for the record when we get a septic
 
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.849 align:start position:0%
and for the record when we get a septic
system

00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
application in we have electronic
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
permitting at the department now for
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
septic systems as representative
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
McConkey knows it's generally a one-day
 
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.190 align:start position:0%
McConkey knows it's generally a one-day
turnaround

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
turnaround
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know and what happens is all of our
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
technical staff have two screens the
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
applicant will submit an application pay
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
it online and you can see on a screen
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
what the design is if there's some
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
issues you can respond in an email
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
electronically the designer can correct
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
it submit new plans electronically and
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
that still may get out the door in a day
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
or two so the process is greatly it's
 
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.609 align:start position:0%
or two so the process is greatly it's
probably

00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
one of the best systems in maybe in the
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
country if not certainly in New England
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
so Ted how often
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
are DS's rules Revisited our rules are
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
good for eight years but we do do them
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
shorter than eight years depending on if
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
there are some biting issues that we
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
really need to address and I think we're
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're we had some legislation passed
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
this year for Wells that were installed
 
00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
prior to 89 so that's going to be a a
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
great benefit to people that have
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
pre-existing 89 Wells so but as far as
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
rules if there's something that we see
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
continually is having a difficult time
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
with the public and with us as well we
 
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:46.730 align:start position:0%
with the public and with us as well we
will

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
go into a roommaking process as you know
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is a six to eight month
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
process it's very time consuming
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so what we try and do is we'll we'll
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
look at issues that concern us a concern
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
the public and we all agree a
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
constituency in ourselves agree then we
 
00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
may let those build so when we do a rule
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
making it's not for one item it may be
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
for multiple because rulemaking is very
 
00:56:16.619 --> 00:56:17.750 align:start position:0%
for multiple because rulemaking is very
involved

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay and my last question is regarding
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
Renovations is there when a property is
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
renovated or is there anything that Des
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
has to approve or permit or once that
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
once the building is built yep there's
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
nothing else they should have a
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
operational approval for if it's an
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
online septic system and unless they're
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
all during the sewage load meaning
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
you're renovating your building and you
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
have a state approval for a two-bedroom
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
house you renovate and you put in
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
another two bedrooms you've got to come
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
back to us to make sure that that site
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
can handle the Wastewater load for an
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
additional two bedrooms okay so that
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
that would be really the only reason if
 
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
you increase the bedroom limit
 
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:02.660 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
if I might or if you get a commercial
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
establishment let's say you run a space
 
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
and you go in or you bought a little uh
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
coffee shop let's say and you had like
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
five seats and three employees and all
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you buy it the building's
 
00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:23.579 align:start position:0%
large enough you now have 50 seats that
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
comes to us as well okay representative
 
00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.250 align:start position:0%
comes to us as well okay representative

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:27.260 align:start position:0%
Wallace
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
are we we're looking to kind of
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
streamlines and maybe not relax the
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
rules but make them a little bit more
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
workable for developers are we still
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
bound to be compliant with the federal
 
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:43.220 align:start position:0%
title V is that no that's Massachusetts
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
God knows we don't want Title Five no
 
00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.809 align:start position:0%
God knows we don't want Title Five no
exactly

00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:57:47.819 --> 00:57:49.130 align:start position:0%
exactly
excellent

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.329 align:start position:0%
excellent
representative

00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:51.359 --> 00:57:53.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
seemed to me
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
um when we were talking before that you
 
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:00.500 align:start position:0%
um require
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
certain systems to be
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
um like let's say the minimum General is
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
four bedrooms
 
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:11.150 align:start position:0%
four bedrooms
um

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
when you're approving a system whether
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
that be a four bedroom or eight bedroom
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
or whatever if the
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
um if they
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
let's say had an eight bedroom septic
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
system approved but they only Built four
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
bedrooms and then they built four more
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
bedrooms it would still be within the
 
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.549 align:start position:0%
bedrooms it would still be within the
the

00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
capacity that the the the the septic
 
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.190 align:start position:0%
capacity that the the the the septic
um

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
the approval was for right and so they
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to come back for that
 
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
additional four bedrooms if they did
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
that 20 years later they would just have
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
to do it if they exceeded what the
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
approved number of bedrooms or wait load
 
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
was and how would that
 
00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.190 align:start position:0%
was and how would that
um be

00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
um be
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
um kind of on the same vein for the
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
commercial ones how would you do that
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you be saying hey the system
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
can handle you know
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
20 occupants you know a day or whatever
 
00:59:13.559 --> 00:59:14.990 align:start position:0%
20 occupants you know a day or whatever
and

00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
you would only revisit that when you
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
went above that 20 occupants or would
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
you just do it whenever they changed
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
from five people to 10 people even
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
though they're both under 20. yeah so
 
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
let's start from the beginning of this
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
process so you've got a particular lot
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
let's say and you've got a construction
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
approval for eight bedrooms right so we
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
go out you install that design it could
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
support eight bedrooms we would come out
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
and inspect it
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
assuming everything was right you'd get
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
an operational approval for eight
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
bedrooms so now you decide as the owner
 
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
that right now in fact you can only do
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
four bedrooms that approval you may have
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
to go to the town you get a building
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
permit you show me construction or your
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
operational approval so going through
 
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
the town process to get a permit if you
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
show a valid operational approval for
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
eight bedrooms then there should be no
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
problems with building the next four
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
same thing commercially it's all about
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
loading per site
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay I'm one last question yes so you
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
were you were talking about having these
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
multiple Wells
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and being kind of avoiding the
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
community well
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
um thing so it seems to me that if you
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
had these let's say you had 20 units
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
um each having uh two different well or
 
01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:48.299 align:start position:0%
you know two Well Servicing these 20
 
01:00:48.299 --> 01:00:50.329 align:start position:0%
you know two Well Servicing these 20
units

01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:00:50.339 --> 01:00:51.349 align:start position:0%
units
um

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
if you want you could do you know two
 
01:00:59.890 --> 01:00:59.900 align:start position:0%
two Wells or three Wells or four Wells
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
servicing each 10 units but
 
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:06.740 align:start position:0%
if you would be essentially
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
incentivizing those
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
um the property owner to
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
um make each of those 10 units be its
 
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
own site instead of to avoid being a
 
01:01:21.609 --> 01:01:21.619 align:start position:0%
community well they would just
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
divide those into multiple sites instead
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
of having one site with three
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
or four Wells is that
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
um like the your understanding of how
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
someone would get around that that
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
Community well thing without being in
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
violation of any rules because
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
technically they are a different site
 
01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:45.059 align:start position:0%
because of the the determination that
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
came out of the doj that in fact is a
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
way around the law all Wells have what
 
01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:54.059 align:start position:0%
we call a zone of contribution so when
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
you look at a particular site that has a
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
particular aquifer whether you've got
 
01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
shallow Wells or Bedrock Wells they are
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
all taking they're tapping the same
 
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.609 align:start position:0%
all taking they're tapping the same
straw

01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
straw
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
the same straw so when you look at it so
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
you've got three different Wells to try
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
and get by this 10 10 and 10 because the
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
community well once you service 15 or
 
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
more you're into testing requirements
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
which in fact should be done you know so
 
01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
to me that's not an appropriate approach
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's getting people around the system to
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
make sure on a rigorous testing schedule
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
on a monthly or a quarterly whatever the
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
schedule is that people are afforded the
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
luxury of having safe drinking water so
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
for someone to come in and try and beat
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
the system that's just not a good thing
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
and that's why if you're trying to add
 
01:02:46.089 --> 01:02:46.099 align:start position:0%
multiple Wells to get 10 10 and 10
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
that's the same straw
 
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
that's the same straw
test

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.410 align:start position:0%
test
okay

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:53.540 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you once again adus uh the
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
legislature and Department worked hard
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general everyone else so I want
 
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
to add a unit uh to an existing site in
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
Adu and I believe the the ruling came
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
through that I don't have to build that
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
septic system a new septic system for
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
that purpose but in the event that the
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
Adu or the house fails then it will be
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
billed at that time
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
how how has that worked out to date uh
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
we don't see a lot of the Adu stuff but
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
again a lot of it we may not know unless
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
something failed but what happens is you
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
well know being a licensed designer and
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
a pretty good one actually I mean he
 
01:03:40.569 --> 01:03:40.579 align:start position:0%
paid me 20 bucks to say that but okay
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
but he and his son both do good work but
 
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
the point being is they come in and it's
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
all about if we go back a little bit to
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
what kind of site loading can a
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
particular Apostle handle
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
so what he's referencing let's say that
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
you've got a three bedroom house it's
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
got a construction approval you get an
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
operational approval and but the lot
 
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
could support four bedrooms but whenever
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
the house was built they decided that's
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
what they needed three-bedroom house
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in a licensed designer
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
they do a plan that shows that in fact
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
by adding an Adu that the site can still
 
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
handle the waste water load that will be
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
generated from the existing three
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
bedrooms to the Adu Adu Wastewater load
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
as he said
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
you're good to go but a year down the
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
road if that system fails we know that
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
you can support the four bedrooms of
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
five or whatever it's going to be and
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
you would have to install that to
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
replace the field system so it's been
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
pretty effective I think thank you so
 
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
are you saying that if an Adu is
 
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.410 align:start position:0%
are you saying that if an Adu is
approved

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's more than what the current septic
 
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
system could hold what would you approve
 
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.750 align:start position:0%
system could hold what would you approve
one

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
like do you have to
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
approve one if you know if you wanted to
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
add an Adu with one more bedroom that
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
system could only hold and Adu would be
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
approved if somebody like a licensed
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
designer does the analytical work to
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
show that the site in fact can handle
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
the additional Wastewater loaders can be
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
generated by that Adu you're good to go
 
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.770 align:start position:0%
generated by that Adu you're good to go
okay

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
now that means you'd get a construction
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
approval you don't have to build it but
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
it clearly shows that you can now
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
support four or five bedrooms on that
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
site whatever it's going to be and
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
you're good to go if the system fails
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
that plan that shows the loading and the
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
system size for five bedrooms needs to
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
be installed okay
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
all right representative yukela one last
 
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.230 align:start position:0%
all right representative yukela one last
question

01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
then we're done we we were arguing a
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
little bit about your response um your
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
your response to my last question was in
 
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
fact it is legal for you to have your
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
because you actually said that that the
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirement is per site
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
right and so if you subdivide that and
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
now have three different homeowners
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
association technically that's three
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
different people okay so can you clarify
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
that a little bit I don't mean to cut
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
you off
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
when you talk about sight if you're
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
talking about three separate parcels
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
all right so you've got three five acre
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
sites or whatever the size is and you've
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
got five units on that site and you've
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
got a well that's fine
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
but if you've got a site the definition
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
of sight versus Lord is very different
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
so if you've got a site where you've got
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
15 units in that one parcel has 15 units
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
on it and you drill three welds in
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
service five five and five that's not
 
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.190 align:start position:0%
service five five and five that's not
legal

01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
so the parcel and and so I don't
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying the lot and
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
parcel are different lot in sight lot in
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
sight so what so the parcel
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm the parcel and site are the same
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
right what what are you trying to to let
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
me make this say science is different
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
you've got a deeded site or lot whatever
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
you want to call it deeded parcel right
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's five acres it's by deed okay it's
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
per deed okay that's that's so so you
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
could just subsidize your 15 acre
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
property into three deeded properties of
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
five acres and then you could do your
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
your yeah that's what I said you could
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
see no you it sounded maybe that maybe
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that was my misunderstanding but when
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
you would I feel like we're getting
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
caught up yeah yeah we're getting yeah
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting caught up in the weeds
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much you're
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
welcome for uh giving us more questions
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
answers no man for the record no I think
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
this kind of conversation is really good
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I think it's one of those things
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
that when whenever uh against changing
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
laws that make more sense I mean rules
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and uh I think representative McConkey
 
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
can contest that we've had many
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups where we listen to
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
people and it's a brain meld you know we
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
don't know everything there's a lot of
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
information that we glean not only for
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
septic systems but all of the water
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
stuff that we do so we never shy away
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
from people getting in a room and having
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
a conversation about
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
what makes sense so if the committee
 
01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:46.100 align:start position:0%
wants to send over something like
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey suggested about
 
01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
things that may white might want to
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
consider then I would never shy away
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
from getting stakeholders involved and
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
say what do you think
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
what do you think what's the approach
 
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
how can we get there I think the stone
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
and pipe thing to me is kind of a
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
no-brainer we know that the Sands
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
carrying the load that's what's treating
 
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
Wastewater I've said for several years
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
now the NFL Trowbridge is my new lrm guy
 
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:18.500 align:start position:0%
I think we're looking at
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
justification that says that stone and
 
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
pipe ought to be treated like other
 
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.809 align:start position:0%
pipe ought to be treated like other
stuff

01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much well thanks
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
for the invite and don't hesitate to
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
call I'd always I'm always willing to
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
participate in a conversation that makes
 
01:09:36.849 --> 01:09:36.859 align:start position:0%
sense for everybody thank you Randy
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we're gonna move right in okay
 
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.809 align:start position:0%
yeah we're gonna move right in okay
Joe

01:09:49.809 --> 01:09:49.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't have time to come out and
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
greet you but you see we're running a
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
little late so it's no problem I know I
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
just want to thank you for taking the
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
time from your very busy schedule to
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
come up and talk to us
 
01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
um Joel witcher's uh engineer from
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester and uh for years he's been my
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
go-to guy if I ever need a question
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
answered or whatever
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
he's got a vast knowledge of most of the
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
planning boards and zoning boards around
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
at least from the middle part of the
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
state south that I know of but whenever
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
I have a question he's the first call I
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
make and he really knows what's going on
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
and he knows what's going on in every
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
city and town around so Joe we're we're
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
formed to see if we can't uh streamline
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
the process into being able to get some
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
time is a valuable commodity that keeps
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
the clock rolling I know and uh
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's why we asked you to come to maybe
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
give us some insight on what some of the
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
different communities do and maybe uh
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
something we can do at the state level
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
to speed the process along so I'm just
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
going to let you run with whatever you
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
want to talk about
 
01:11:12.719 --> 01:11:15.550 align:start position:0%
want to talk about
oh

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so uh first of all thank
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
you for having me my name is Joe wicker
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
and as a representative baruti said
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
um I own I'm a self-employed land
 
01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
surveyor out of Manchester so I think
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
I've been on my own since uh 91. I think
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
I was licensed in 90 I'm a licensed
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
septic designer as well
 
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.890 align:start position:0%
septic designer as well
um

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
you know and when I talked to Ben we had
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
some conversations about
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
um about this issue right so in in
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm also a member of the
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
housing commission and
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're seeing the same
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
things in in Manchester that everybody's
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
seeing so you know I think the best
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
example I can kind of come up with to
 
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
try to illustrate what I think we're up
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
against is
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
back in 93 or 94 my firm
 
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
did a little three four lot subdivision
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
in the city
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
for some reason the owner never recorded
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
the mylar and 20 something years later
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
we get a phone call saying hey you know
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
we need do you have the my the original
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
mylar we don't
 
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
so we have to work with the city and try
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
kind of resolved this because it was
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
previously approved so it's just sort of
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
a matter of just how we how we take care
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
of the the details of it but I started
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
laughing and I and I brought the plan
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
when I brought the plan down to staff
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
and I was showing them you know in 1993
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
or 94 we showed the boundary lines we
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
showed the buildings a few notes it was
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
kind of straightforward in 2023
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
you know we have like a dozen notes we
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to show topography buildable area
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
building boxes we have to have a
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
building area table we have to subtract
 
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
out areas of steep slopes we have to
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
take out areas of easements existing and
 
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
proposed right and all these items you
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
know take a consultant time so therefore
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
they add on to the cost and you know the
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
bigger item in my world is a lot of
 
01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:20.300 align:start position:0%
these things
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
will void out a lot right so if you you
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
know the simple example is in Manchester
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
which is the one I'm most familiar with
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
you know they have a buildable area
 
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
requirement so if you're in a zone that
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
requires 7 500 square feet that 7 500
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
has to be fully buildable
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
and you know so they Define buildable as
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
anything under a 25 slow which you know
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
in buildable areas and topography 25
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
slope that's probably not necessarily
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
the most unreasonable item to say
 
01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
except for if you're in a city and
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
you're on Municipal sewer and water and
 
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
you have a little band that's three foot
 
01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:02.810 align:start position:0%
you have a little band that's three foot
tall

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
tall
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
and it's only 10 foot wide or five foot
 
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.649 align:start position:0%
and it's only 10 foot wide or five foot
wide

01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
wide
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
now all of a sudden I can't make that
 
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
lot work so I have to go to the Zoning
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment and I have to say
 
01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.149 align:start position:0%
Board of adjustment and I have to say
listen

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
I have 7 500 square feet but it's not 7
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
500 square foot buildable by definition
 
01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
so therefore I have to go get a variance
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
before I can go to the planning board
 
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:25.910 align:start position:0%
before I can go to the planning board
um

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
you know in a lot of the towns in the
 
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.290 align:start position:0%
you know in a lot of the towns in the
cities

01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know you could say they're trying
 
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
and and I probably believe some are but
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily convinced that that
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
translates to boards right so you may
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
have politicians and in groups and
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
commissions and task force and
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
everything that say Yep this is a
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
problem and this is what we need to work
 
01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.070 align:start position:0%
problem and this is what we need to work
with

01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
but when we go to a planning board or a
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
zoning board we don't necessarily get
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
the same response you know and so we did
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
a subdivision
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
um on a parcel of land that was about 22
 
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.729 align:start position:0%
um on a parcel of land that was about 22
Acres

01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
Acres
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
our role in it was to just subdivide the
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
parent tract off you know to subdivide
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
the 22-acre track from the parent tract
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
and then it was going to get sold and
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
then further develop but the owner
 
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
didn't want to develop it at this time
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
so you know to to help with the pricing
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
and everything we did a concept we said
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay listen 22 Acres with these
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
frontages this minimum area we came up
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
with 33 lots and out of those 33 Lots I
 
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
think the only waivers we would need
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
were for Centerline Road radius on on
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
the road system
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
so we meet with the town and we say okay
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know this is what we have for a
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
concept and we get told well
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going to waive the Centerline
 
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
Road radius requirement you know they
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
had a 300 foot radius
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh road which in a in a rural area that
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
that makes sense because you don't want
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of sharp turns but we were coming
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
off of an area that was gridded out that
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
had 90 degree intersections we were
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
coming off of an area with 90 degree
 
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.590 align:start position:0%
coming off of an area with 90 degree
intersections

01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
intersections
 
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
so you're saying okay well would you
 
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
give me anything you know would you
 
01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
would you support any kind of waiver and
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
they we go back and forth we kind of
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
come up with a number we go back we we
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
rework the concept we come up with 31 I
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
think we lost a couple Lots
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
there's a buyer for the property we go
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the development we go to the
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
planning board to subdivide that land
 
01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
and one of the last
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
words of wisdom we were given from the
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
planning board chair was well you should
 
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
tell the buyer that that's two debts
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
right so if you're thinking about it and
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
you say okay well if I have 22 acres and
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
if I have half acre zoning
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
the simple mass is 44 but then you have
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
to back out your road some of your steep
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
slopes and things like that
 
01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.770 align:start position:0%
slopes and things like that
but

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know to say that 31 is too isn't is
 
01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
is too many you know that it doesn't
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
make sense to me because I think what we
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
should be encouraging is to we come off
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
of areas all the time where the existing
 
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
developments are more
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh more compact than what the current
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
ordinance requires and so those areas
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
should be the ones that you know we
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
should get waivers for you should get
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
variances for it'll match the existing
 
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
variances for it'll match the existing
areas

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and and then therefore we get more
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
housing units right if the developer is
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
Happy the town in theory should be happy
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
um the neighbors will necessarily never
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
be happy but you know that's part of
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
living next to a large undeveloped
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
property that you don't own
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
we do multiple projects where we come in
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
and we see we try to propose a a lot
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's undersized or lots that are
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
undersized or more units that are
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
allowed by the current ordinance
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
and you know our running joke is the
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
people that are complaining are
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
typically on lots that are smaller than
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
our on the average lot size we're
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
proposing with lost Frontage and more
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
debts so you're looking at them going
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
well but how does it reduce the value of
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
your property because it's bigger than
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
yours and and that seems to get to get
 
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
lost so
 
01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.290 align:start position:0%
lost so
um

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
you know I can
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
as I got older I guess you start looking
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
back so I started off in the 80s and in
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
the 80s You could argue that there were
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
probably some developments and plans
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
that weren't necessarily fantastic ones
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that is part of what drove
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
you know the seven 60s 70s and 80s kind
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
of everybody did this certain thing you
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
had the Boom in the mid 80s and after
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
that I you know we noticed where things
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
started tightening up right and when
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
they started tightening up everybody
 
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
came up with different systems to kind
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
of reduce the density in all these other
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
items and some of those might have been
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
warranted and they might have been based
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
in fact but a lot of them the way their
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
interpreted or employed
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily work out that way
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know like Renee was here and
 
01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.410 align:start position:0%
you know like Renee was here and
um

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
you know we get we go to towns that have
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
soil based zoning so if you have uh
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
on-site well and septic you know instead
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
of having a 200 foot of Frontage two
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
acre zoning you could have on-site um
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
soil based zoning So based on either the
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
high intensity soil survey or the soils
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
something mapping
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
um site-specific mapping you end up with
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
the new higher soil scientists they
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
break out the soil types you do kind of
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
a weighted average and you can figure
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
out what your what Your lot size should
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
be right and all right that's based in
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
science to a degree so you'd say that
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
that probably isn't the worst thing we
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
could look at
 
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
but a lot of towns will
 
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
still have a minimum and that minimum
 
01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
will be over what the size is that the
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
numbers would so you sort of lose the
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
advantage of soil based zoning so soil
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
based zoning is if you have good soils
 
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
you should have more units if you have
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
poor soils you should have less units
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
but if the town has a requirement that
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
you have to stay at a certain Frontage
 
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
and area
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
and even though by Zone by soils you
 
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
could do two two units in there you know
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
we don't get the we don't come up with
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
the density that that would be there by
 
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.090 align:start position:0%
the density that that would be there by
right

01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:23.930 align:start position:0%
right
um

01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
you know and I had talked to you know
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
we've gone back and forth with this on
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know on different groups that I'm
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
in and and how we how you get there and
 
01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
how you can make it better and things
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
like that so you know at the end of the
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
day I think I'm a Believer in local
 
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
zoning I'm not necessarily to a point
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
where I'd want to see say State zoning
 
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
because I don't think you could Zone
 
01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester the same way you could Zone
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro New Hampshire they're they're
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
just different so you have to allow but
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
what frustrates me is when I was on uh
 
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
before I got on the Housing Commission
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
of Manchester
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know we did an analysis or a a guess
 
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
an educated guess right a swag we came
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
up with and said Yep this is where this
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
is our number and so you know Manchester
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
has roughly 51 000 units it was
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
projected that we had a half a percent
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and average or ideal would
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
be a three to five percent vacancy rate
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
so if you took straight numbers
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
you know we would need an increase of
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
roughly 4 000 uh you know uh to get to a
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
four percent four and a half percent
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
increase that's roughly a two thousand
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
two thousand units right well Manchester
 
01:21:37.739 --> 01:21:39.050 align:start position:0%
two thousand units right well Manchester
has

01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think we're we're approaching 2 000
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
units that are either in the queue
 
01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
approved or in construction
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
um we still have half a percent vacancy
 
01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:50.750 align:start position:0%
um we still have half a percent vacancy
rate

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
so we have a half a percent vacancy rate
 
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.350 align:start position:0%
so we have a half a percent vacancy rate
because

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
some of the surrounding communities you
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
know Manchester May approve 1900 but the
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities might approve
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
50. so a lot of those people from the
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities as they get
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
older and want to kind of downsize will
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
come to the city which you know is is
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
not a bad thing it's a good thing but
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
if the communities that aren't
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
staying up with what they need to for an
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
increase in numbers you know if there
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
were a way to incentivize that or
 
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
were a way to incentivize that or
somehow

01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
um make it work better and and we went
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
back and forth is you know could you
 
01:22:33.719 --> 01:22:35.930 align:start position:0%
back and forth is you know could you
localize

01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
localize
 
01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
the waiting list right so if a if a
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
community provides a hundred you know
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
100 affordable units my understanding of
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
the current system is you still go on
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
the master list and you get prioritized
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
on the master list and then you get
 
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
assigned to the unit as it comes open
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
well would there be a way to
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
bump your priority if you're a resident
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
of this community and the community has
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
provided a hundred units of affordable
 
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
units right you could still take some
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
people but if we could figure a way to
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
to incentivize communities to to look at
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
it that way that their people could stay
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
in their communities if they chose to
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
you know I think that would be a good
 
01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:19.460 align:start position:0%
thing so I was trying to keep my initial
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh Spiel short so I'd be happy to answer
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.169 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:38.540 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
soil based
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
um zoning lot requirement or size
 
01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
um zoning lot requirement or size
requirements

01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
um do you think that that is
 
01:23:48.659 --> 01:23:49.910 align:start position:0%
um do you think that that is
um

01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
a way that
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
that is a good way of moving the state
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
forward do you think that these you know
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
say two acre or five acre just generic
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
lot requirements is appropriate or and
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
we should be sticking with that as a
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
state or should we be moving more
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
towards like uh soil based zoning where
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
where the it's not a hard and fast rule
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
but looking at the site for the minimum
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh that is allowable
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
so I think if we're you know if you're
 
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
going to go with science then soil based
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
zoning is the closest we have
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
because that's based on the carrying
 
01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
capacity of the soils and you know lots
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
that have great soils are going to be a
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
smaller size lots that have some
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
Wetlands steep slopes Sledge they're
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
going to be larger
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
um so I I do like it but you know my
 
01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.330 align:start position:0%
um so I I do like it but you know my
problem

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
has always been you have communities
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
that are anywhere from 80 to 95 percent
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
built out the majority of them are built
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
out on either 150 or 200 foot of
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
Frontage an acre and a half two acre
 
01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
Frontage an acre and a half two acre
zoning

01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
we come in now and we say okay we're
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
going to go to soil based zoning you
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
know how do we get any increase in
 
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.490 align:start position:0%
know how do we get any increase in
density

01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
density
 
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I think you know for new
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
developments yeah it'd be great if if
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
the town would accept it or if they
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
would allow some kind of cluster
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
development with an equation to figure
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
out your buildable area based on the
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
actual property instead of just a number
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the zoning ordinance came up to
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
because you know I'm not I'm not a
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
believer in that zoning is
 
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.610 align:start position:0%
believer in that zoning is
um

01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
was totally a stop growth measure but
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
I've been around long enough to live
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
through two of the boom bust cycles and
 
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
we had growth management ordinance in
 
01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
the mid twos that were you know we we
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
had to we could only give out two
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
permits a year because if we gave out
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
more than two permits a year we were
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to overwhelm schools and in 2023
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
just about every Community I know of has
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere between a 10 and 20 reduction
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
in school population
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
right so if we had we would have had
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
more units out there I mean you know
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
personally we I was a a partner in a
 
01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.729 align:start position:0%
personally we I was a a partner in a
development

01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
um and you know you build the
 
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but you can only sell two
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
lots a year it's hard to make a lot of
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
money out of that
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
right so you're not going to get you
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
know you're not going to get it now in
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
today's world which is similar to what
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
it was in six and seven you know you
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
might have somebody that's willing to
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
take that risk on the hope that they're
 
01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
going to get there but you know luckily
 
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
we don't have as many communities with
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
growth management ordinances anymore
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're at least that way
 
01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.570 align:start position:0%
they're at least that way
okay

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Joe
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
um of all the units that are approved
 
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
now in Manchester do you know how many
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
I think Manchester is about
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
375 ish
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
out of the I think it's about 375 out of
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
out of the 1900 or so and and why
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
what incentive is there for someone to
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
build affordable housing what can we
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
offer somebody to want to go down that
 
01:27:06.659 --> 01:27:08.510 align:start position:0%
offer somebody to want to go down that
route

01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
route
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
so I guess in the Manchester example I
 
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
think probably half to 60 percent of
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
those units are one project with a
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
developer that has a different model
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
that I've never I had never seen until
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
this where it's based on all tax credits
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
and things like that and all the units
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
are affordable right and so that is and
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Dupont is probably much better verse
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
to explain the intricacies of that than
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
I am but for me
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
you know I think I'm a Believer in the
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
way that if we're gonna
 
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
if we're going to see more units you
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
have to incentivize it right so margins
 
01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.790 align:start position:0%
have to incentivize it right so margins
are

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
margins are hard right now because of
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
expiring costs and things like that so
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
if we could you know my theory was
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
always in the city which you know we're
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
I'm the most involved in if we could
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
come up with like a Redevelopment zone
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
so you take areas of the community that
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
are sort of blighted that need some
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment and you say okay here's
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
what we want to see you know the current
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
zoning is X
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you X plus 25 but in
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
out of that 25 percent you have to give
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
a proportion a portion of that 25
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
percent have to be affordable right and
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
then the developer wins you get some
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
extra market rate units you get some
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
affordable units and the community wins
 
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
because we get more affordable units and
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
then you know if you take certain
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
communities a larger more developed
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
communities you know we are going to
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
have gentrification going on you know
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
we're going to have in a perfect world
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
or not perfect world however you want to
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
phrase it that you're going to have
 
01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:47.540 align:start position:0%
areas that are
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
underutilized and sort of blighted now
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
that are going to be redeveloped when
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
those areas are redeveloped we're going
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
to lose some of the naturally affordable
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh the natural occurring affordable
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
housing so you know now we become into
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
the you know can we come up with a
 
01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
system to have the the number of units
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
um that we're building or we're the new
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
number units can it replace the existing
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
units we're losing right and it's going
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
to be I think that's a big ass to
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
replace that existing number in my
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
position has been I think we have to
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
accept that the number may be a hair
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
less but the quality of the units will
 
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
be substantially better
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
so no one will be living in
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
um you know a Triple Decker that hasn't
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
been updated in 70 years and and has all
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
these uh faults with it they'd be living
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
in new housing you know and and they'd
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
be have similar amenities to the people
 
01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
that they're living next to that are in
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
a market rate unit
 
01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.750 align:start position:0%
a market rate unit
okay

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
um what about a community Manchester
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
needs housing so to give them incentives
 
01:29:58.850 --> 01:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
is one thing but what about a community
 
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.590 align:start position:0%
is one thing but what about a community
that

01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
um doesn't want a lot of
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
apartment dwellings or condos is there
 
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
anything you can think of to give them
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
an incentive to allow it
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
the only way I said my theory would be
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
you prioritize you you change the
 
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
priority of the list and I don't know if
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
that breaks some kind of federal
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
guideline State guidelines or whatever
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
but somehow there should be a way that a
 
01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
community that produces a certain number
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
of affordable units can kind of keep a
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
percent of those units for the residents
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
right that way it's the only way that
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
um they're going to kind of personalize
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
this you know we did a project
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
um where we tried to do 14 units sort of
 
01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
like modular housing and it was similar
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
to another modular housing or
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
manufacture housing Park that was less
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
than 400 feet away
 
01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
we were denied the waiver so instead of
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
having 14
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
modular housing units we ended up with
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
six stick built units
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
so the difference being those six stick
 
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
built units are probably going to be
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
High fours to high fives versus if we
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
had the 14 modulars maybe they would
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
have been 354 right and you know people
 
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
will say well it doesn't sound like a
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
huge difference but I think if you're
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
the person trying to buy it it is and we
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
actually had a person on the planning
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
board who supported it for that reason
 
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
they were looking for a house
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
and they they knew the numbers and they
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
were like hey you know if we give them
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
this it's going to help with that so
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative Conkey
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you sir for being here you
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
bring a
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
you bring an area of discussion that I'm
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
not usually accustomed to being the
 
01:31:55.689 --> 01:31:55.699 align:start position:0%
urban environment
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if I if I heard you
 
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
correctly in some of in some of your
 
01:32:04.490 --> 01:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
properties that you've designed for
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
built on talking about minimal lot size
 
01:32:10.729 --> 01:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
and excludes uh parts parts of that
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
property that have a slope of 25 percent
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
um there there was a time
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
when 25 slope was uh was a difficult
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
item to deal with uh Construction and
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
building and now 25 is not that's I'm
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
thinking of infill lots especially uh so
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if and I understand and I
 
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
have you know 15 18 years on zoning
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
boards and everything else that you know
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
local is always better and it's it's
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
hard to get even the people sitting at
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
our table to agree that the state should
 
01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
mandate but
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps perhaps we could come up with
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
some legislation that was that was
 
01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.950 align:start position:0%
some legislation that was that was
recommending

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.649 align:start position:0%
recommending
um

01:33:02.649 --> 01:33:02.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
that in situations within Phil
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
if you meet these requirements you've
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
got septic handled whether it's on-site
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
or off-site municipal or whatever if the
 
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
slope of the lot was not a deterrent to
 
01:33:20.209 --> 01:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
the building if you were mindful of
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
existing neighborhood density I'm paying
 
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:25.580 align:start position:0%
attention to what you're saying here and
 
01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
these items then it should be considered
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
as opposed to Shelby I'm just thinking
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
if you get some language out there that
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
we could get support for it might it
 
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
might get some of those towns that are
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
saying no at least the opportunity to
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
say if there's people on their boards
 
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we could go in that
 
01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we could go in that
direction

01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
think we would have any merits sir yeah
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
I mean I so we're working on one now
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
where the the local requirement is 15
 
01:33:56.639 --> 01:33:57.770 align:start position:0%
where the the local requirement is 15
percent

01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
right to me 15 is to say it's
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
non-buildable silly
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
and especially in New Hampshire where
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to have you know rugged
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
terrain it's so you know if we adopted
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
Des rule 35 percent and up was
 
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
considered non-buildable everything
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
underneath maybe you can give the towns
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
some leeway that they could do a
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
weighted average that if you're above 25
 
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
percent it's only 80 percent it only
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
counts as 80 percent instead of a
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
hundred right yeah that would I think
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
that has some merits
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
um you know the
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's the time my argument when we
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
talk to a client my line is always
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
listen it's their home court all we're
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
doing is playing by their rules so they
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
have all the cards the best we can do is
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
react and you have towns that can
 
01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
control it through zoning ordinances and
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
regulations and waivers you have towns
 
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
um Wetland setbacks that you know will
 
01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
cost you two to five thousand dollars to
 
01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:02.330 align:start position:0%
cost you two to five thousand dollars to
appeal

01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
and I think we had one town where we
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
went in and you know we are we argue
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
that we should get a reduction in the
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
waiver and we were told the the
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission members said
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
well you know we don't really agree with
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
your consultant's report
 
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
because the Consultants always say it
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
could be reduced
 
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
and as I've gotten older I tend to have
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
less of a filter
 
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
and so when when it was said I looked at
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
them and said well yeah 125 feet is the
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
silly requirement so why to get me to 75
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
which is all we were asking for you
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
should approve it but local
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't like that because
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fit what they perceive they
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
their Community should be I mean I think
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
if you could if you could standardize
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
Wetland setbacks based on science if you
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
could standardize slopes
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I think those items would still give
 
01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:01.100 align:start position:0%
the town some input that you're not
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
we're not taking away their their
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
um can you you you you talk about how
 
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:22.450 align:start position:0%
um can you you you you talk about how
um

01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:22.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.129 align:start position:0%
um
maybe

01:36:24.129 --> 01:36:24.139 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
incentivizing these
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
um affordable units and I assume that
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
you're meaning
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
um affordable by
 
01:36:34.199 --> 01:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
um affordable by
by

01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
um not
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
that the house is built affordable but
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
that it's agreed to be a s rented or
 
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
sold at an affordable rate for a certain
 
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
amount of time right but
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
um that those go to a certain residence
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
inside of the
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
um Community I don't see how
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
um the board the planning board
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
um or the zoning board
 
01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
or the mayor or anyone
 
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
would be make a decision
 
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
for more
 
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
um you know units because they are going
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
to the population
 
01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:24.659 align:start position:0%
that is already living there can you
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
explain how you would see that as an
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
incentive to those Regulators to allow
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
those those units to be built more
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
um without hindrance I guess based on
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
your view that they would be going to
 
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
the people that are already living in
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
we could try I'm not sure it'll work I
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
think the problem is
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
The Regulators aren't the people on the
 
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:55.070 align:start position:0%
The Regulators aren't the people on the
board

01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
right so I think if we went to the Town
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
Council the board of Mayor and Alderman
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
and said listen if we approve this if we
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
rewrite this zoning ordinance we're
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
going to hopefully get an additional X
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
number you affordable units per per year
 
01:38:13.729 --> 01:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
right and I think
 
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
the majority of those units would either
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
end up being rentals or
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a condominium because from what
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
I've heard
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
when you try to manipulate the
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
affordable to fee ownership it becomes
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
problematic like I know Nashua has a
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
Nashville has a
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
inclusionary zoning ordinance right and
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
so we've I've talked just as part of my
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
work on the Housing Commission I've
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
talked to the National planner
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
and so one of the unforeseen issues
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
they've had is if you regulate the value
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
of a house your
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
reducing the income of that owner
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
because for most people their residence
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
is their main you know is their main
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
their largest asset so if you if you
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
stipulate that the house can only
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
increase at a certain percent and the
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
remainder has to be affordable you've
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
Defeated You've defeated them gaining
 
01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:15.179 align:start position:0%
generational wealth to do it so I think
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
it has to be broken down that I'm not so
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
sure on fee ownership we're going to
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of input but the hope would
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
be is for rentals maybe some
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
condominiums that you could and you know
 
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
would they agree to it you know I'm I'm
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the fence on that I mean it's the
 
01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
only thing short of changing everything
 
01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
around and saying this is what it is
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to follow the same
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
Rule and these are the numbers we're
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to have you know I I don't want to
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
see a situation where we do a project in
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
a planning board or a Housing Commission
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
or a zoning board can say we want X
 
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
percent of these units is Affordable
 
01:39:55.970 --> 01:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
because I think what you'd see happening
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
is the remaining units are going to
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
basically subsidize the affordable units
 
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
and now what we've done is we've
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
increased the rents and the cost to the
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
other unit so somehow if we could break
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
it out into a system where
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of the infrastructure is already
 
01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
being built but the developer is getting
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
more units
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know maybe there's a way to to make
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
great well thank you very much for
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
coming presenting to us I appreciate it
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
all right so our next presentation is
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know your name could
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.930 align:start position:0%
you come up thank you thank you
um

01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:49.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
how's that there we go is that good okay
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for for having me today my
 
01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
name is Ron Dupont and I do I do want to
 
01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:03.659 align:start position:0%
apologize upfront because I have even
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
less of a filter than Joe because I'm
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
older than Joe okay
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just gonna tell you
 
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
how it is and and my thoughts okay first
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
of all I think you should know some
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
something about me okay uh I'm a New
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire native born raised my wife is
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
also uh we love the state uh we've been
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
to every tourist attraction that there
 
01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
is probably three four five eight times
 
01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.530 align:start position:0%
is probably three four five eight times
okay

01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:31.250 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
we uh my wife and I both work in the
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
business uh I work hard I was in this
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
morning at seven o'clock and I have a
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
five o'clock meeting which is probably
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
gonna last a while
 
01:41:44.219 --> 01:41:45.470 align:start position:0%
gonna last a while
okay

01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
um I own and I don't have a lot of
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
Partners I basically have one okay and I
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
own a little bit over 1800 Apartments
 
01:41:58.370 --> 01:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay I've been doing this a while okay I
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
started with a three family home in
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hudson New Hampshire which I just sold
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
two three years ago
 
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh just built are probably one of the
 
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
coolest buildings in the state of New
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in downtown Manchester that
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
was uh what's the right word that I
 
01:42:17.050 --> 01:42:17.060 align:start position:0%
should use okay but difficult
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
challenging frustrating I want to hit my
 
01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
head against the wall and it probably
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
would have felt good okay
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
um I also started about five or six
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
years ago a single family home business
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
longest story my daughter got married to
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
this really hard working guy for from
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
Maine he's a real salt of the earth type
 
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
of guy Hands-On so we're building some
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
homes and I'm gonna hopefully at some
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
point talk about what Joe was actually
 
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
just talking about Nashua the
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
inclusionary zoning ordinance there I
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
have specific a specific example it's
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
happening right now it's hugely
 
01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.109 align:start position:0%
happening right now it's hugely
frustrating

01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
frustrating
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
we don't think we're going to be able to
 
01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
build 83 homes
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
exit one Nashua but I'm not I'm going to
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
start first on a few other things if if
 
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
it's my fault
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
I have not been talking to my Alderman
 
01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:16.790 align:start position:0%
I have not been talking to my Alderman
enough

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
but I don't have time I'm running the
 
01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.390 align:start position:0%
but I don't have time I'm running the
business

01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.310 align:start position:0%
business
okay

01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
let's talk 409 Elm Street in man in
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester okay I started the building
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
process about six year year years ago
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
concerning zoning planning had a
 
01:43:36.649 --> 01:43:36.659 align:start position:0%
neighbor who didn't
 
01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
agree with what was happening I went for
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
three variances of which an attorney of
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
Joe's still here is it is it gone yeah
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
he's gone okay okay uh that Joe uses a
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
lot John John Cronin and John said these
 
01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:57.260 align:start position:0%
are three very very very simple
 
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
variances okay so we we got all three
 
01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
um the neighbor appealed all three it
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
took me to Superior Court okay it was
 
01:44:08.219 --> 01:44:09.350 align:start position:0%
took me to Superior Court okay it was
there

01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
um and so slow down the project for by a
 
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
long time we just wrapped it up in the
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
past three or four months
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay a lot of construction issues but
 
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to go there because of
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
the times that we are in lack of quality
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
lack of quality lack of quality in this
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
in the in this country amazes me amazes
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
me okay
 
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.010 align:start position:0%
me okay
um

01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.709 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
one specific item there so eversource
 
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay after our request gave us a letter
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
that said we had consistent power it's
 
01:44:46.609 --> 01:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
right on Elm Street it's what is it one
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
half a mile a mile from City Hall
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
okay beautiful okay went to the fire
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
department with that they said wonderful
 
01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to have a generator
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
there hundred fifty thousand dollars and
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it takes up space and has to be
 
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
maintained I don't have to have a
 
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
generator so I just saved myself a
 
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty thousand dollars I'm
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
pretty happy go to the go to the
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
planning department beautiful okay you
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a generator
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay then the State Fire Marshal got a
 
01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
hold of it he said wrong you have to
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
have a generator for the building now
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
the only reason to have a generator for
 
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
the building would be okay for the two
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
hours that power goes down in downtown
 
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester for about every five or ten
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
years I don't exactly remember what the
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
letter said it's two three years ago now
 
01:45:46.450 --> 01:45:46.460 align:start position:0%
okay in case someone on a six six floor
 
01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
okay has something happened to them a
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
heart attack or what whatever the case
 
01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
is okay so the fire department has to
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
have access to the to the elevator okay
 
01:45:58.129 --> 01:45:58.139 align:start position:0%
to bring down the person on a stretcher
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever the case is
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
okay hundred and fifty thousand plus
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
yearly maintenance of about five
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as afford
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing you can't build
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
affordable housing the only way you can
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
do it is through government entities and
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the state of New
 
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the feds and everything
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
else there's not enough money for
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
affordable housing ever in my lifetime
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
in your lifetime whatever the case is
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's just never going to happen with
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
that said you have a lot of affordable
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
housing out there the state of New
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a lot of affordable
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
housing okay I mean the place that that
 
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
I was raised a small ranch probably a
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet on Ross Street in
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
Nashville Nashville New Hampshire right
 
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
across from Sandy Pond I was raised
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
there born there and everything else
 
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
okay it just sold for like 320. okay
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's you know now when interest rates
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
were at three or four percent there
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
really wasn't a heavy lift for a lot of
 
01:47:00.189 --> 01:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
people okay there's a lot of tapes
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
splits everything else out there that's
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
affordable housing you don't need a new
 
01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
house to be affordable housing I don't
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
think there's no need for that how many
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
home single-family homes are there out
 
01:47:16.850 --> 01:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
there in the state a lot of them a lot
 
01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
of them if you don't want to live in
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
Nashua or you want something that's a
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more affordable go out to
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
potentially an old uh an older house in
 
01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
New Boston or Wilton or Hillsborough or
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's affordable housing out there
 
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
there always has been there always will
 
01:47:34.570 --> 01:47:34.580 align:start position:0%
there will be fixer-uppers that you can
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
buy and get a good deal on and and build
 
01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
and and rehab and and all that okay so
 
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
so so anyway I digressed a little bit so
 
01:47:46.490 --> 01:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
so at 409 Elm Street we have 90
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
Apartments commercial first floor plenty
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
of parking I want to stress that plenty
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
of parking okay and
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
um so so that's my little story on the
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
150 000. I want to talk about landlord
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
tenant laws also a little bit
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant laws in the state of New
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are pretty Crystal Clear
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat simple for a guy like me who's
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
been through it over and over and over
 
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
again and I'm a Hands-On guy I go to
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
district court and I purchase all the
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
paperwork and that stuff okay okay
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
who does if you want to make the
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant laws more intricate
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
which somehow reason it it you know the
 
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
legislature and always tries to do every
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
single year okay who are you hurting are
 
01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
you hurting a guy like me who
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
understands landlord tenant law
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
extremely well no no you might make it a
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
little harder a little bit more
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
difficult but you're not hurting me
 
01:48:48.530 --> 01:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
you're hurting the person who owns that
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
three unit that's a neighbor of yours
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
that four unit that's a cousin of yours
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's six unit that invested everything
 
01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
that they had okay and bought a you know
 
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
a multi that's the person and by the way
 
01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.229 align:start position:0%
a multi that's the person and by the way
who

01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
are they servicing those are probably
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
affordable units market rate affordable
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
units what a wonderful thing the
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
government's not involved okay the
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
cities I mean
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's who you're hurting you're not
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
hurting a guy like me anymore although
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
he still owns twos and threes and fours
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
and fives and sixes and that stuff okay
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
you're not hurting the the new guy who's
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
building in Downtown Manchester 250
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
units you're not you're not hurting the
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
person who's uh you know the a bigger
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
company uh someone's I think flatley's
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
building 60 80 units downtown Concord
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
here you're not gonna hurt him okay
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
because number one everybody who he
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
rents to there's going to be two three
 
01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:51.179 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar rents okay they're gonna
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
have good credit okay they're gonna pay
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
their rent okay that they're not going
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
to have issues with cars and and
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
sickness issues where they can't pay 99
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
of the time
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay so so anytime anybody thinks about
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
making the landlord tenant issues uh
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
laws more strict or whatever the case is
 
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
understand you're hurting the smaller
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
guy or gal who's renting affordable
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
units okay I want to talk specifically
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
about what Joe talked about here and Joe
 
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I I didn't know Joe was going to be
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
here I didn't know he was going to bring
 
01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
this is an appeal that's probably going
 
01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
to happen shortly okay we bought about
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
two and a half year years ago the Old
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
Camp ducat at exit one in Nashua
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
we we're going for approval we were
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to go last week it got pushed
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
off by five or six weeks by the way it
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
took us two and a half years to get
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
there longest story okay it got pushed
 
01:50:58.609 --> 01:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
off another three or four weeks okay so
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're going for to build 83 units we're
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
the first one okay to be the what I'll
 
01:51:07.129 --> 01:51:07.139 align:start position:0%
call and I say this kindly the guinea
 
01:51:10.930 --> 01:51:10.940 align:start position:0%
pig okay to build with the new izo
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance inclusionary zoning
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
ordinance in Nashua okay we have to
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
build nine affordable single family
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
housing units now remember what Joe just
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
said okay those nine units will not be
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
able to sell okay the inflation will not
 
01:51:33.729 --> 01:51:33.739 align:start position:0%
impact their value so you're reducing
 
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
the worth of those people in the in
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
future years if they buy there by the
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
way I'm not sure if they can add a deck
 
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
or if they can add a porch oh looks like
 
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:45.380 align:start position:0%
I will explain why so so the zone
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
ordinance was passed about a year and a
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
half ago we met with
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
the planning director we met with the
 
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
mayor and saying where are the
 
01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.270 align:start position:0%
mayor and saying where are the
regulations

01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
how can you get a bank loan okay to
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
build something if if the banker asks
 
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
you what are you going to be able to
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
sell the homes for
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
we don't know we think we think okay two
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
of the homes have to be sold for about
 
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
two hundred eighty thousand a lot in
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
Nashua single family lots worth of has a
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
value about 175 200 210 okay you got to
 
01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
build the entire home for about 270 to
 
01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
280. then then after you have to build
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
seven more homes
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
okay for approximately 380 390 we think
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
the key word there is we think you know
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
why because they passed the ordinance a
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago we went to see the
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
mayor in the planning director six
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
months after that because we were hugely
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
frustrated okay we walked out of the
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
room the planning director says we'll
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
get those regulations done within a
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's a year
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
they're not done
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a year
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
so we're going to get this approved but
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
we it's not I don't think it's going to
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
get built
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
83 homes in Nashua at exit one
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
are probably not going to get built okay
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
because the regulations are extremely
 
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
unclear they're not passed and even the
 
01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance is rather unclear this
 
01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:24.179 align:start position:0%
is happening right now 83 homes will not
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
get built most probably so let let me
 
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
let me ask you um are you is that appeal
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
going through the Superior Court no this
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
is a law firm okay that's coming to the
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
planning board okay to voice their
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
opinion concerning not uh not
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
suggesting to the planning board to not
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
accept the 83 housing units now when I
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't know where it's going to go from
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
for from there okay
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
um but I'll read you the first three
 
01:54:02.209 --> 01:54:02.219 align:start position:0%
lines of one of their statements in its
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
current state the property is a treasure
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
Trove of Natural Resources especially
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
established mature trees in the national
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
land use code places great weight on
 
01:54:15.729 --> 01:54:15.739 align:start position:0%
this now this is an old boy scout camp
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
we now own it we're paying taxes on it
 
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
a few of the neighbors use it many of
 
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
the neighbors use it for walking paths
 
01:54:32.209 --> 01:54:32.219 align:start position:0%
to walk their dog to you know one
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
neighbor said there was a bear on it
 
01:54:35.810 --> 01:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
there was a beer cave or whatever the
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
case is we had to hire a naturalist to
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
go and make sure there wasn't a bear
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
that lived there okay it's so it's to
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
say that it's
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
not frustrating it's it's hugely
 
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
frustrating okay
 
01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:55.940 align:start position:0%
um in Nashua okay in 20 2015
 
01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
282 homes closed okay in 2016 324 in
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
2017 322. these were all set single
 
01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
family okay in night in 2023 156 have
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
closed so basically half and we have so
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
much more demand because so many people
 
01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:18.179 align:start position:0%
have moved into the state we need more
 
01:55:23.209 --> 01:55:23.219 align:start position:0%
homes okay no one's I'm looking for a 14
 
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
to 1600 square foot single family
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing being built in Nashua
 
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay I have a friend who lives very
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
close to me or did live okay he moved to
 
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
Amherst he didn't want to move to
 
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
Amherst he bought a home that's about 20
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
25 years old he wanted to move into a
 
01:55:43.850 --> 01:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
new home okay this nothing is virtually
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
nothing for sale in Nashua we want to
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
build 83 homes and I don't think they're
 
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:53.689 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:55:53.689 --> 01:55:53.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
I hired it I'm sorry is that because of
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Nashua inclusion Arizona yeah and we
 
01:55:59.930 --> 01:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
don't know what the regulations are and
 
01:56:01.490 --> 01:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
they haven't been passed and they we we
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
were told they were going to be passed
 
01:56:04.609 --> 01:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
within a couple months after I'm meeting
 
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
with the mayor and just not going to
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%

01:56:52.490 --> 01:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
build what you want to build okay and
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
I'll give you one of the variances I
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
need okay per the zoning audience in
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%

okay okay I got that through
 
01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay so what did I do 15 variances this
 
01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
guy told me run it would be better to
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
hit your head against the wall and I saw
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
so I just stopped okay so I still own
 
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
the piece of land okay I I have other
 
01:57:26.450 --> 01:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
buildings on it it's paying for the
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
taxes okay I can't do everything okay so
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
I chose to go in a different direction
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
um it's again that's my fault I should
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
be talking to the Town Council I should
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh potentially try to vote in in all
 
01:57:44.450 --> 01:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
these towns it's illegal I'm just
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
kidding that about that okay but you
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
know it's and I think your hands are
 
01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.530 align:start position:0%
know it's and I think your hands are
tight

01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
tight
 
01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
your hands are tied I shouldn't be
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
talking to you I should be talking in
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
front of the board of Miranda Alderman
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
in Nashua I bet you anything they don't
 
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
know what's happening with their zoning
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
ordinance right now and the the Ico that
 
01:58:05.089 --> 01:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
that much okay I should be in in front
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
of the Town Council in Derry
 
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay I should be
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of what I'll call political
 
01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.030 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of what I'll call political
stuff

01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%

the town of Derry one of their
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
requirements was 800 square feet uh

what do you see the market what how many
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
square feet are you typically proposing
 
01:59:20.089 --> 01:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
to build
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
um well let's pick a perfect example
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
something that I just built okay there
 
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
were a 90 90 Apartments okay I have uh
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
10 apartments with some revolutionary
 
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
Cloud beds longest story there okay the
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
bed just goes up in the air okay
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
um those are expensive okay those are
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
364 square feet okay I have some largest
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
Studios that are about 400 70 square
 
01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
feet like so so the the cloud bed Studio
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
I think I have 10 of them the the other
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
Studios I think I have uh another ten
 
02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
don't quote me okay and then after I
 
02:00:03.050 --> 02:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
have a lot of one beds 40 one beds that
 
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
are about
 
02:00:04.619 --> 02:00:05.450 align:start position:0%
are about
um

02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
either 680 or 720 square feet and I have
 
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:12.380 align:start position:0%
22 beds that are
 
02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
950 60 square square feet okay
 
02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%

Okay
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
um that's I from my perspective a
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
a a portion of the affordable housing
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
out there now that they're not
 
02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
you know depending on your Viewpoint
 
02:00:35.689 --> 02:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
those are going for fifteen hundred
 
02:00:37.970 --> 02:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
dollars a month okay but it includes
 
02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:39.589 align:start position:0%
dollars a month okay but it includes
Wi-Fi

um it includes a lot of things okay uh
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry go ahead and if I could follow
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
up so the way where you're speaking of
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the the mix of 360 to 950 was that it
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
is that at your 409 Elm Street property
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
um can we go back to the State Fire
 
02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:07.310 align:start position:0%
um can we go back to the State Fire
Marshal

02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
Marshal
 
02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
um issue that you had
 
02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:10.750 align:start position:0%
um issue that you had
um

02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
were they trying to
 
02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:14.169 align:start position:0%
were they trying to
um

02:01:14.169 --> 02:01:14.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
enforce some
 
02:01:20.689 --> 02:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
some uh regulations that they have or a
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
state law
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
um do you know
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
um it's certainly it they consider it a
 
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
health and safety issue obviously okay
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
um okay either statutes written on it to
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I'm not absolutely
 
02:01:38.689 --> 02:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay represent McConkey um thank you and
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank the representative for jogging my
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
memory here so representative that's not
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
here a member of the commission had a
 
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that came through
 
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
committee and approved uh where the town
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
had gone through for private land owner
 
02:01:59.689 --> 02:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
on a private piece of property the town
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
standard was I think eight feet for a
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
private driveway to one residence went
 
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
through the whole process built built it
 
02:02:08.689 --> 02:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
everything the planning board said he
 
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
could do should do just have the fire
 
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
Marsh or fire chief come in and say you
 
02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
know that driveway's got to be 12 feet
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
wide times 300 you know foot in length
 
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to give your
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
occupancy permit it got worked out to a
 
02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
certain point but we passed legislation
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
that said if if
 
02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
um if a person goes through a town
 
02:02:35.330 --> 02:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
planning process and receives all of
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
their approvals and the fire marshal or
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
the fire chief has recommendations above
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
and beyond that the planning board will
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
consider those thoughts
 
02:02:51.169 --> 02:02:51.179 align:start position:0%
and we got we got the fire marshal to
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
buy into that so I'm I'm wondering if
 
02:02:59.089 --> 02:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
maybe we expand that language so okay so
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
I I I I really am glad to hear your
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
testimony and talking about having to
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
throw a a hundred and fifty thousand
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
dollar generator for the inavailability
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
of something that might happen once or
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
once or twice a year but if not once or
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
twice a year it's probably you know I
 
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
mean it's a lot less than that but would
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
you would you agree as a developer if if
 
02:03:23.689 --> 02:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
I I I'm a developer I I want to know the
 
02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
rules I only work in towns that have
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
zoning because I want to know the rules
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
I want to know what my costs are if we
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
could somehow get language in there to
 
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
that effect would you think that would
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to you as a rather large
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
developer yes okay and understand that
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
the authority in the state of New
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the most powerful is
 
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
the fire department
 
02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
understand that okay
 
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
very important statement that I just
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
all right well at any more questions for
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
Mr DuPont
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
what do you think think about uh there's
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
been some talk about
 
02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:13.430 align:start position:0%
been some talk about
um

02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
additional requirements
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
um that it kind of goes back to your
 
02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:20.270 align:start position:0%
um that it kind of goes back to your
Innovative

02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
Innovative
 
02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:20.890 align:start position:0%
Innovative
um

02:04:20.890 --> 02:04:20.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
zoning issue or not inclusionary zoning
 
02:04:24.599 --> 02:04:25.609 align:start position:0%
zoning issue or not inclusionary zoning
issue

02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:04:28.189 --> 02:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
the board or the zoning board or the
 
02:04:38.169 --> 02:04:38.179 align:start position:0%
planning board putting on regulations or
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
requirements on top of the actual stated
 
02:04:42.599 --> 02:04:44.270 align:start position:0%
requirements on top of the actual stated
requirements

02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
um in the zoning or in the regulations
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
after the
 
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the you know you you read them you
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
you design a plan that meets them and
 
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
then you go and they're like oh we want
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
to do this but that's not in the
 
02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:01.609 align:start position:0%
to do this but that's not in the
regulations

02:05:01.609 --> 02:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and so you have to go back and do
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
more work has that ever happened to you
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
what do you think about requiring that
 
02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
they oh that they cannot put in
 
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
additional requirements on that they
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
have not previously you know published
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
and had public hearings on et cetera et
 
02:05:19.729 --> 02:05:19.739 align:start position:0%
cetera I mean there is language that was
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
just put in that the fees have to be
 
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
published well fees that's one thing
 
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
there's other requirements right to your
 
02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
point exactly okay so I'm not sure I get
 
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
the the the years correct I think okay
 
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
um I I think I may have my notes but we
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
we bought the Doucette property exit 127
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
Acres okay
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
um in something like May of two years
 
02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:46.910 align:start position:0%
um in something like May of two years
ago

02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
so we signed the purchase and sale
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
five months before
 
02:05:55.250 --> 02:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
okay we had no idea izo regulations were
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
even contemplated by the city of Nashua
 
02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
we purchased it our attorney Andy
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
Pearlman who's probably the most
 
02:06:05.570 --> 02:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
well-known land planning attorney in
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
Nashua didn't know about it either
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
because he handled the the transaction
 
02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
somehow we found out okay so now all of
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
a sudden we got to build okay nine
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
affordable units at at the beginning we
 
02:06:24.290 --> 02:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
didn't know what price it hadn't even
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
passed the zoning board longer story
 
02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
they slowed it down in my humble opinion
 
02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:33.179 align:start position:0%
that's only my opinion okay so that we
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
just couldn't get it through
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and so then after they passed the
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance and and now we're just getting
 
02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
there with no regulations so so I so I
 
02:06:45.410 --> 02:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
think to your statement we bought it
 
02:06:49.129 --> 02:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
with no idea okay even when we owned it
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
for quite a while we had no idea and
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
then after they passed the Ico and that
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
puts huge pressure on land okay at the
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
end of the day I think this land still
 
02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
has the value that we paid for it but in
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
potentially a real world or not in a
 
02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
hyper housing World okay whatever we
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
paid it would be worth less because
 
02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
you can't put in regulations that impact
 
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
your use without impacting value for the
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
most part now it could be you put could
 
02:07:21.169 --> 02:07:21.179 align:start position:0%
put regulations I guess in or take them
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
away that that a positive okay in this
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
case they're negative remember
 
02:07:29.930 --> 02:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
if we if we could just build out that
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
land it would be it would be built right
 
02:07:35.930 --> 02:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
now it would be being built so okay so
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
with 60 to 80 homes
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr Dupont it's been
 
02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:42.589 align:start position:0%

accessory dwelling units in New
 
03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:47.330 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units in New
Hampshire

03:05:47.330 --> 03:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:47.340 --> 03:05:53.090 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:05:53.090 --> 03:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
this project uh included a team of
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
myself as lead researcher and writer and
 
03:06:01.790 --> 03:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
the speaker for you today uh also Sylvia
 
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
Alec uh from Southern New Hampshire
 
03:06:07.010 --> 03:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission and Benjamin Frost
 
03:06:09.530 --> 03:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire housing
 
03:06:11.929 --> 03:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
just a quick note that uh this project
 
03:06:13.550 --> 03:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been possible without New
 
03:06:14.929 --> 03:06:14.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing that provided the
 
03:06:17.389 --> 03:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
funding to conduct This research
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh and just a quick note on the mission
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire housing they have a
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
mission to promote finance and support
 
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for the people of New
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and since 1981 they've built
 
03:06:29.809 --> 03:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
more than
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
um they've helped more than 45 000
 
03:06:33.769 --> 03:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
families purchase a home and they've
 
03:06:36.590 --> 03:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
built more than 15 000 multi-family
 
03:06:39.170 --> 03:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
units in the state so it's it's uh
 
03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
why are we talking about adus today well
 
03:06:48.290 --> 03:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh as a solution to housing it's
 
03:06:50.809 --> 03:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
necessary there's a a lot changing about
 
03:06:53.690 --> 03:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
the economy uh an affordability of
 
03:06:56.929 --> 03:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
housing is as uh a low if not an
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
all-time low right now
 
03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
um the inability of our state to build
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient housing presents a real risk
 
03:07:06.650 --> 03:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
to the overall economy and uh we've seen
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
that uh Community Health assessments
 
03:07:10.670 --> 03:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
have identified housing as a primary or
 
03:07:12.889 --> 03:07:12.899 align:start position:0%
key need in order to achieve positive
 
03:07:15.290 --> 03:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes for uh the people of New
 
03:07:15.300 --> 03:07:17.210 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes for uh the people of New
Hampshire

03:07:17.210 --> 03:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
as a solution adus offer a lower cost
 
03:07:23.150 --> 03:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
alternative to traditional forms of
 
03:07:25.370 --> 03:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
housing that we've seen built in the
 
03:07:29.210 --> 03:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.010 --> 03:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
I had a couple slides in here about
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
declining Supply you guys have already
 
03:07:35.929 --> 03:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of that I think by now so I
 
03:07:38.690 --> 03:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
cut them out in the the skinny here is
 
03:07:40.849 --> 03:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
that with such a low vacancy rate in the
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
state it blocks the ability of people to
 
03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
choose housing and it uh is keeping
 
03:07:48.290 --> 03:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
people from entering into Home Ownership
 
03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:58.490 --> 03:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
I won't go through all this but uh there
 
03:08:00.410 --> 03:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
are a lot of ways that adus create
 
03:08:04.330 --> 03:08:04.340 align:start position:0%
opportunities across Society
 
03:08:07.849 --> 03:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
in this table I have here just looks at
 
03:08:11.450 --> 03:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
a cross-section of different uh elements
 
03:08:13.370 --> 03:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
of society such as economic social
 
03:08:16.610 --> 03:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
environmental uh
 
03:08:19.849 --> 03:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
um focus or disciplines and then the
 
03:08:22.730 --> 03:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
users of adus or the beneficiaries of
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
adus such as homeowners renters families
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
seniors in the general public and uh
 
03:08:31.309 --> 03:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
really there's there's a a multitude of
 
03:08:34.010 --> 03:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
ways the adus can have a positive impact
 
03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
on society that's kind of the takeaway
 
03:08:38.210 --> 03:08:38.220 align:start position:0%
from the slide so if you're interested
 
03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
in getting into any of the details of
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
what I flash in the screen here today I
 
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
will present I will share these slides
 
03:08:47.809 --> 03:08:47.819 align:start position:0%
with you and and you can dive into them
 
03:08:49.070 --> 03:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
in more detail
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
and almost all this content shows up in
 
03:08:54.170 --> 03:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
the the report that's available on New
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
before we dive into research I just want
 
03:09:03.410 --> 03:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
to talk about I got three slides here to
 
03:09:06.130 --> 03:09:06.140 align:start position:0%
talk about what Nadu is in New Hampshire
 
03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
and so RSA 674 71 defines adus and of uh
 
03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:14.469 align:start position:0%
and so RSA 674 71 defines adus and of uh
in

03:09:14.469 --> 03:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:09:20.330 --> 03:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
674.72 is uh language around uh kind of
 
03:09:22.550 --> 03:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
framing what's allowable for a to use
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so I've highlighted a couple of
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
things here I just want to hit upon
 
03:09:28.730 --> 03:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
which are important uh important to the
 
03:09:30.769 --> 03:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
production of adus in the state
 
03:09:33.410 --> 03:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
and the first one is the definition
 
03:09:36.170 --> 03:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
defines native as attached
 
03:09:40.010 --> 03:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
or within a single family dwelling and
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
there is additional language uh in RSA
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
73 which uh conflicts with this it says
 
03:09:50.030 --> 03:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
a town may allow detached and so this is
 
03:09:51.889 --> 03:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
something I want to focus on there's a
 
03:09:53.150 --> 03:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of conflict within the
 
03:09:56.090 --> 03:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
state's language and uh it leaves the
 
03:09:58.370 --> 03:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
door open to restricting to attached
 
03:09:58.380 --> 03:09:59.630 align:start position:0%
door open to restricting to attached
only

03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh some other things here on the right
 
03:10:03.769 --> 03:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
hand side uh
 
03:10:06.830 --> 03:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
it says here that uh adus can be loud as
 
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
a matter of right uh like a Buy Right
 
03:10:11.450 --> 03:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
Use or at through a conditional use
 
03:10:13.309 --> 03:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
permit or a special exception of the
 
03:10:13.319 --> 03:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
permit or a special exception of the
zoning

03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
um and that opens the door to requiring
 
03:10:19.790 --> 03:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
hearing hearings in order to get your
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
Adu permitted
 
03:10:24.429 --> 03:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
so something to keep note of
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
this Section 3 has something about
 
03:10:30.170 --> 03:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
requiring an interior door between the
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
principal unit and the and the accessory
 
03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
unit this really only applies to
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
attached data use but the language again
 
03:10:38.269 --> 03:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
for somebody who doesn't know the rules
 
03:10:41.809 --> 03:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
that well might find this confusing
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
section uh six here
 
03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
a municipality may require owner
 
03:10:50.809 --> 03:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
occupancy and we've seen in uh the state
 
03:10:52.370 --> 03:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that you know somewhere
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
between around a half of the
 
03:10:56.690 --> 03:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
municipalities to two-thirds uh require
 
03:11:00.769 --> 03:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
and then we already covered this 73 the
 
03:11:06.170 --> 03:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
last one here about allowing uh
 
03:11:08.090 --> 03:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities to choose whether or not
 
03:11:10.490 --> 03:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
to allow detached adus
 
03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
so that's New Hampshire's rules in a
 
03:11:15.650 --> 03:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
nutshell abbreviated
 
03:11:17.150 --> 03:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
um what did we see in our national
 
03:11:20.410 --> 03:11:20.420 align:start position:0%
research well uh there's
 
03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
three uh regulations that uh put it
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
pretty put have a pretty significant
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
cooling effect on the production of adus
 
03:11:32.210 --> 03:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
and those three regulations are owner
 
03:11:34.130 --> 03:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
occupancy requirements
 
03:11:37.010 --> 03:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
off-street parking requirements and
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit hearings so those
 
03:11:43.490 --> 03:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
three things alone uh
 
03:11:45.710 --> 03:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
put a significant dent in the number of
 
03:11:48.410 --> 03:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
people who would have the capacity to go
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
pull a permit for an Adu
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:57.650 --> 03:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side we have a few
 
03:11:59.510 --> 03:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
more and I sorry I kind of butchered the
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
numbers here uh but there's limiting
 
03:12:04.130 --> 03:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
regulations around the dimensional size
 
03:12:08.210 --> 03:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
of an Adu that also limit how and where
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
adus can get built Brothers other than
 
03:12:12.530 --> 03:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
to note them
 
03:12:15.110 --> 03:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh things like lot setbacks having large
 
03:12:19.130 --> 03:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
lot setbacks limits uh where an Adu is
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
possible especially in Village centers
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
or uh the cities of New Hampshire
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh size limits that are proportional to
 
03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
Primary Home tend to have uh be a little
 
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
bit regressive uh towards people who
 
03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
have small homes because then they can
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
only have an even smaller Adu so that
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
creates some challenges uh minimum lot
 
03:12:39.650 --> 03:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
sizes which luckily in New Hampshire we
 
03:12:41.269 --> 03:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
don't have that issue
 
03:12:41.279 --> 03:12:42.170 align:start position:0%
don't have that issue
um

03:12:42.170 --> 03:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:46.250 --> 03:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
the the prevailing zoning is required to
 
03:12:48.769 --> 03:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
control the lot size for adus in New
 
03:12:50.950 --> 03:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's it's a non-issue
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
then type restriction so we just saw
 
03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
this in the previous slide that New
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire allows municipalities to
 
03:12:58.910 --> 03:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
restrict detached at you that uh
 
03:13:01.969 --> 03:13:01.979 align:start position:0%
restricting detached datus has a pretty
 
03:13:04.010 --> 03:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
significant cooling effect on the
 
03:13:05.690 --> 03:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
production of adus
 
03:13:08.690 --> 03:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then finally development fees uh
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's there's there's documented proof
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
that uh when these fees are waived
 
03:13:14.269 --> 03:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
either permanently or for a period of
 
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
time to jump start the production
 
03:13:20.690 --> 03:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
um that it has a a measurable impact on
 
03:13:24.050 --> 03:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
the number of permits that are requested
 
03:13:26.450 --> 03:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
and all this is pretty thick so we'll
 
03:13:27.889 --> 03:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
get through this and then you won't have
 
03:13:30.170 --> 03:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
to look at this anymore uh we'll get
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
into some lighter content but uh these
 
03:13:34.429 --> 03:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
are a couple recommendations I would
 
03:13:36.230 --> 03:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
have for the state in terms of
 
03:13:38.269 --> 03:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
increasing Adu production just through
 
03:13:42.170 --> 03:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
amendments to RSA 674. uh the first one
 
03:13:44.090 --> 03:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
is to change the definition to include
 
03:13:47.090 --> 03:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
detached adus the second is to make all
 
03:13:49.610 --> 03:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
adus and as of right use so eliminate
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
that conditional use permit hearing I I
 
03:13:53.929 --> 03:13:53.939 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't think that that's
 
03:13:56.210 --> 03:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
something that would go over easy uh you
 
03:13:57.889 --> 03:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
know in terms of the effect on local
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
land control but if you wanted to have
 
03:14:03.650 --> 03:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
an impact where adus were being built at
 
03:14:06.050 --> 03:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
higher rates it has proven that what do
 
03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
you mean by I'm sorry what do you mean
 
03:14:10.250 --> 03:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
by conditional use permits that's a good
 
03:14:15.230 --> 03:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes so there's you could either have a
 
03:14:19.130 --> 03:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
hearing through your zoning or planning
 
03:14:21.290 --> 03:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
board which uh that hearing would
 
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
involve you proving that there's a need
 
03:14:27.050 --> 03:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
for you to have this and you would need
 
03:14:29.929 --> 03:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
to notify your Butters go to the hearing
 
03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
um the the the the board that's
 
03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
overseeing this use permit would then
 
03:14:35.760 --> 03:14:36.830 align:start position:0%
overseeing this use permit would then
have

03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:14:38.809 --> 03:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide feedback
 
03:14:40.910 --> 03:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
about your project and attach certain
 
03:14:43.309 --> 03:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
stipulations to its approval or they
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
could outright deny your request so uh
 
03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
if you think about this from the terms
 
03:14:50.030 --> 03:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
of a homeowner they might need to spend
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
a several thousand dollars you know get
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
a site survey hire an engineering
 
03:14:57.290 --> 03:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
professionals a civil professional and
 
03:15:00.650 --> 03:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
architect to present plans and they
 
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
might do all that and still get to a no
 
03:15:04.969 --> 03:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
answer and so they might spend several
 
03:15:06.889 --> 03:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that they could not
 
03:15:09.469 --> 03:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
then not recoup so that that presents a
 
03:15:12.170 --> 03:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
real risk to the household
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if the household's a little
 
03:15:15.469 --> 03:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
better off maybe they can afford to take
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that risk but
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
um we we know that
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh something like two-thirds of
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
households don't have you know more than
 
03:15:26.090 --> 03:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
a week or two of uh salary Savings in
 
03:15:27.769 --> 03:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
their bank accounts so they they just
 
03:15:29.809 --> 03:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
literally don't even have the money to
 
03:15:33.769 --> 03:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
as of right is uh uh usually an
 
03:15:38.090 --> 03:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
application process so you would fill
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
out an application all the rules would
 
03:15:41.450 --> 03:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
be laid out in front of you by the staff
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
the planning staff would put together a
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
checklist you would fill out the
 
03:15:46.370 --> 03:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
checklist you provide all the
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
documentation requested and then the
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
staff would review it and either approve
 
03:15:52.490 --> 03:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
it or deny it and in some rare instances
 
03:15:59.389 --> 03:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh two other recommendations here uh it
 
03:16:04.429 --> 03:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
one is to override local off street
 
03:16:06.889 --> 03:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
parking requirements one of the things
 
03:16:09.170 --> 03:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
we heard from the zoning Atlas was that
 
03:16:12.410 --> 03:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
some towns had Fairly High requirements
 
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
three four parking spaces for an Adu
 
03:16:18.290 --> 03:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
which seems like kind of a thinly veiled
 
03:16:20.889 --> 03:16:20.899 align:start position:0%
way to block Adu production
 
03:16:24.530 --> 03:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
and so it seems that local local land
 
03:16:26.809 --> 03:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
use boards are sort of abusing their
 
03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
their powers to to restrict this kind of
 
03:16:31.010 --> 03:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
housing type
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh and then fourth is the owner
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
occupancy requirement this is a little
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
bit of a double-edged sword people get
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
upset at the idea of eliminating owner
 
03:16:42.889 --> 03:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
occupancy requirement uh and the reason
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
is it it makes the home more vulnerable
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
to becoming an investment product for
 
03:16:50.750 --> 03:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
someone someone buys it rents out both
 
03:16:52.790 --> 03:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
the main house and the Adu and then now
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's out of the pool of people who can
 
03:16:56.929 --> 03:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
compete to own and own a home right
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's a real risk the other end of that
 
03:17:01.969 --> 03:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
is we know that when you know large
 
03:17:05.330 --> 03:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
Capital Pools get a hold of a successful
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
model for profit they would churn these
 
03:17:10.130 --> 03:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
things out in in big numbers and so you
 
03:17:12.050 --> 03:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
have to kind of choose your path which
 
03:17:13.849 --> 03:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
way you want to go so when people ask me
 
03:17:15.650 --> 03:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
my recommendation owner occupancy
 
03:17:15.660 --> 03:17:16.730 align:start position:0%
my recommendation owner occupancy
requirement

03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
I I really don't I don't have a
 
03:17:22.070 --> 03:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation that is
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
it it depends on what you want to
 
03:17:25.250 --> 03:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
achieve if you really want to achieve
 
03:17:27.170 --> 03:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
home ownership then require the owner
 
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
occupancy if you want to build a whole
 
03:17:30.230 --> 03:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
lot of units in a short amount of time
 
03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
s all right so I apologize that was kind
 
03:17:40.730 --> 03:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
of thick and a little a little much but
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to hit on that because we
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't really talk about it for the rest
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
of it and the reason I brought up all
 
03:17:49.070 --> 03:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
this local regulatory stuff is as you'll
 
03:17:51.230 --> 03:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
see later in this presentation almost
 
03:17:54.410 --> 03:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
every one of the case studies uh started
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
with some kind of liberalization of
 
03:17:59.450 --> 03:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
local regulations and then momentum
 
03:18:01.309 --> 03:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
built from there and so you'll see the
 
03:18:03.650 --> 03:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
theme of this unfold as we go but
 
03:18:06.530 --> 03:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
in short uh the research goals are are
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
as follows to explore policies and
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
programs implemented in other states
 
03:18:12.889 --> 03:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
seeking to encourage and support the
 
03:18:14.450 --> 03:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
creation of adus
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
and the tools and techniques so uh we
 
03:18:20.630 --> 03:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
present how in this report how New
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can use these identified
 
03:18:26.929 --> 03:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
um strategies of other locations in
 
03:18:28.849 --> 03:18:28.859 align:start position:0%
order to develop their own regulations
 
03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
and programs to stimulate the creation
 
03:18:33.290 --> 03:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
of adus
 
03:18:35.090 --> 03:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
and the scope work kind of breaks down
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
like this case study research we'll talk
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
about those analysis of policy
 
03:18:41.630 --> 03:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
identified tools and techniques
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios for Adu production and then
 
03:18:47.090 --> 03:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
not in this presentation but in the
 
03:18:48.530 --> 03:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
report that's on New Hampshire housing's
 
03:18:49.550 --> 03:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
web page
 
03:18:52.190 --> 03:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
all of this has you know there's
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
probably over a hundred links to Source
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
materials and reference materials
 
03:18:58.670 --> 03:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
throughout it so if somebody was
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
inspired by anything they saw in this
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
report they would very quickly be able
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
to get to the core information of how
 
03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
the policy is run and how the program is
 
03:19:10.190 --> 03:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
operated and replicate it if they wanted
 
03:19:12.349 --> 03:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
03:19:15.290 --> 03:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about case studies
 
03:19:17.809 --> 03:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
there's three areas of focus that we set
 
03:19:19.309 --> 03:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
out with and when we started this
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
research it was affordability programs
 
03:19:25.490 --> 03:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
pre-approved plan programs and design
 
03:19:27.469 --> 03:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
initiatives so let's talk about the
 
03:19:29.690 --> 03:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
first one I'll give an example of one of
 
03:19:31.849 --> 03:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
these for each of these Focus areas
 
03:19:34.250 --> 03:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with affordability
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
on a high level I'll just mention the
 
03:19:37.849 --> 03:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
three case studies that exist for the
 
03:19:40.250 --> 03:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
affordability uh component of This
 
03:19:43.250 --> 03:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
research the three are Barnstable Mass
 
03:19:46.130 --> 03:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
which is Cape Cod or a good chunk of
 
03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
Cape Cod uh Boston Massachusetts both of
 
03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
those have loan programs and then the
 
03:19:54.050 --> 03:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
third is California which has a grant
 
03:19:57.530 --> 03:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
program and so uh the first two are
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
really focused on local programs and
 
03:20:02.150 --> 03:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives in California is is a state
 
03:20:03.530 --> 03:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
initiative so we'll look at the state
 
03:20:05.929 --> 03:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
one since you guys that's kind of your
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
scope here we're talking about State
 
03:20:07.680 --> 03:20:09.050 align:start position:0%
scope here we're talking about State
stuff

03:20:09.050 --> 03:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
03:20:12.370 --> 03:20:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
's uh our biggest state in the nation
 
03:20:17.450 --> 03:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's 44 million people it's enormous
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
California has a program that was part
 
03:20:22.370 --> 03:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
of a much larger legislative action on
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
adus and housing which again liberalized
 
03:20:28.969 --> 03:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
rules around adus and invested a
 
03:20:31.750 --> 03:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money into
 
03:20:34.190 --> 03:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
facilitating production across a whole
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
range of uh elements of housing it's not
 
03:20:39.849 --> 03:20:39.859 align:start position:0%
that different than the invest NH
 
03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
initiative that the state of New
 
03:20:46.130 --> 03:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:49.849 --> 03:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
within this larger legislative action uh
 
03:20:52.190 --> 03:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
they had this 100 million dollars set
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
aside for adus and it sounds like an
 
03:20:56.570 --> 03:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
enormous number and it is because it's
 
03:20:59.210 --> 03:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
an enormous state but uh as we'll see
 
03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
later if you uh sort of uh scale that to
 
03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
the population of New Hampshire it would
 
03:21:07.370 --> 03:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
be not more than a four million dollar
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
program so so totally feasible
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
achievable size scale program for the
 
03:21:14.570 --> 03:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
03:21:16.370 --> 03:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
so what do they do here they have a
 
03:21:18.650 --> 03:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
grant and to be eligible for it you have
 
03:21:20.929 --> 03:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
to be a working class household so what
 
03:21:23.330 --> 03:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
how do you define that that's uh less
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
than 120 percent of the area of median
 
03:21:25.439 --> 03:21:26.389 align:start position:0%
than 120 percent of the area of median
income

03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
income
 
03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
and the grant uh is designed to serve
 
03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
these households to help them get over
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
the hurdle of uh permitting and approval
 
03:21:38.809 --> 03:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.610 --> 03:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
um the way they do this is that
 
03:21:43.730 --> 03:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
California Housing Finance Authority uh
 
03:21:45.889 --> 03:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
is administering the Grant and they work
 
03:21:48.349 --> 03:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
directly with lending institutions to be
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
the grant escrow managers so the state
 
03:21:54.349 --> 03:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
passes this bill says Housing Finance
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
Authority go figure out how to get this
 
03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
money out in the community the Housing
 
03:22:00.050 --> 03:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority goes to the local
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
banks and says we would like you to sign
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
up to serve as the escrow manager for
 
03:22:07.010 --> 03:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
these funds and work with households to
 
03:22:08.210 --> 03:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
get them to a place where they can build
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
their Adu and in return that homeowner
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
is probably going to take a loan with
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
you to build to do the construction part
 
03:22:16.490 --> 03:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
of their project which is really pretty
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
clever it plays the incentives of the
 
03:22:20.690 --> 03:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
lender it places the incentives of the
 
03:22:22.849 --> 03:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
homeowner and uh links them together
 
03:22:24.910 --> 03:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty smart
 
03:22:27.889 --> 03:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh the state of California managed to
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
spend this hundred million dollars in
 
03:22:31.969 --> 03:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
just a few short months which is pretty
 
03:22:34.429 --> 03:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
incredible it shows the Merit of how
 
03:22:37.190 --> 03:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently the program was run and uh
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
it provided a booster shot to the Adu
 
03:22:42.889 --> 03:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
industry in the State uh you know within
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
the last two years the Adu industry has
 
03:22:47.769 --> 03:22:47.779 align:start position:0%
seen uh
 
03:22:52.849 --> 03:22:52.859 align:start position:0%
literally dozens of manufactured uh uh
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
Adu uh so prefabricated accessory
 
03:22:58.490 --> 03:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit manufacturers popping up
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
all over the state and we're not talking
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
like small outfits build a dozen here
 
03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't there we're talking uh
 
03:23:06.889 --> 03:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
factories 200 300 000 square feet you
 
03:23:08.690 --> 03:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
know anticipating building hundreds of
 
03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
adus a year so a pretty substantial
 
03:23:12.889 --> 03:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
investment of capital by the Private
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
Industry as a response to this 100
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars pushing demand into a a
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
place where it was feasible for Capital
 
03:23:23.570 --> 03:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
to invest in it
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
so uh so we we talked about kind of the
 
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
the framework of the the program and how
 
03:23:30.830 --> 03:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
how it works I haven't told you what the
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
use of the funds were and that's
 
03:23:35.210 --> 03:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
pre-development cost and so all eligible
 
03:23:38.570 --> 03:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
costs would be the design of the Adu the
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
permitting of the Adu so to get all your
 
03:23:43.910 --> 03:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
approvals in place the site work so any
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
kind of groundwork that we you know need
 
03:23:47.090 --> 03:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
to put in a new sewer line or something
 
03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
between the house and the Adu you can do
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
that and then finally if you have money
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
left over after all that you can buy
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
down interest rate points on your loan
 
03:23:56.690 --> 03:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
with the bank it's another reason to
 
03:23:59.090 --> 03:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
work with the bank this is uh Mutual
 
03:24:01.570 --> 03:24:01.580 align:start position:0%
sort of relationship
 
03:24:05.630 --> 03:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
this program is very well designed to
 
03:24:08.150 --> 03:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
serve households that don't have cash on
 
03:24:10.610 --> 03:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
hand but likely have a pretty high level
 
03:24:14.210 --> 03:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
of equity in their home and that's a key
 
03:24:16.010 --> 03:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
group to work with you know they want to
 
03:24:17.570 --> 03:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
build an Adu but they don't have the ten
 
03:24:18.769 --> 03:24:18.779 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to get permitting
 
03:24:21.290 --> 03:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
approval to get a loan well we'll help
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
you get through that portion and get
 
03:24:25.610 --> 03:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
your loan and boom they're on their way
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
they've they've got a new Revenue Source
 
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
or they're housing a family member at a
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
much lower cost than they would have
 
03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:32.929 align:start position:0%
much lower cost than they would have
otherwise

03:24:32.929 --> 03:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
some some side notes about this housing
 
03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
and Finance Authority worked with the
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
state's planning office to document and
 
03:24:44.090 --> 03:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
and track data on this so it's kind of
 
03:24:45.469 --> 03:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
hard to read at the scale but all those
 
03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
little thoughts are constructed and
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
permitted adus within the state and uh
 
03:24:52.610 --> 03:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
because they they have all this
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
excellent source data there's a lot of
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
really good research going on about the
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
effects of Adu production on the economy
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
of California so something to keep in
 
03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:03.110 align:start position:0%
of California so something to keep in
mind

03:25:03.110 --> 03:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:25:05.330 --> 03:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
just to put things back into perspective
 
03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:06.590 align:start position:0%
just to put things back into perspective
here

03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:25:11.330 --> 03:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
they've built 22 600 something adus and
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
a two-year span
 
03:25:16.250 --> 03:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
but that's only 0.3 percent of all
 
03:25:17.929 --> 03:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
single family housing stock in the state
 
03:25:20.570 --> 03:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
of California so it's it's literally a
 
03:25:22.490 --> 03:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
drop in the bucket like if you got to
 
03:25:23.870 --> 03:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
think about this stuff in terms of scale
 
03:25:27.290 --> 03:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
so uh you know it it's it all seems very
 
03:25:29.330 --> 03:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
massive until you think about it in in
 
03:25:31.250 --> 03:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
relation to the 44 million people that
 
03:25:33.530 --> 03:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
live there
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
uh I already talked about this a little
 
03:25:38.330 --> 03:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
bit but this yellow box is the high home
 
03:25:41.570 --> 03:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
equity low-income household or maybe Low
 
03:25:44.570 --> 03:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
Cash reserves uh a key demographic to
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
serve because once they get over that
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
hurdle of getting permanent approvals in
 
03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
a construction loan they're good to go
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're in a really good place and
 
03:25:54.530 --> 03:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
you're serving a group that likely has a
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
higher housing need than the rest of the
 
03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:58.370 align:start position:0%
higher housing need than the rest of the
population

03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:01.190 --> 03:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
all right so that's affordability I give
 
03:26:02.450 --> 03:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
you one example out of three because
 
03:26:05.150 --> 03:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're a little short on time but uh I'd
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
like to now talk about pre-approved
 
03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
plans and so you might be asking what is
 
03:26:12.769 --> 03:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
a pre-approved plan and uh the
 
03:26:15.950 --> 03:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
pre-approved plan is basically an
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
architectural plan of the Adu that is
 
03:26:22.969 --> 03:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
stamped and ready to be used so all the
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
review process is taking place for that
 
03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:25.790 align:start position:0%
review process is taking place for that
unit

03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:26:27.889 --> 03:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
except for where it touches the ground
 
03:26:31.130 --> 03:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
right and this has a lot of value in
 
03:26:32.690 --> 03:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
terms of cutting down the amount of
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
Labor that a planning department has to
 
03:26:37.010 --> 03:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
do to review a unit if they have the
 
03:26:39.229 --> 03:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
same Adu come through and they've
 
03:26:40.729 --> 03:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
already stamped it and they're reusing
 
03:26:42.650 --> 03:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
those plans they don't have to check any
 
03:26:44.929 --> 03:26:44.939 align:start position:0%
of the engineering or roof loads live
 
03:26:47.330 --> 03:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
loads they don't have to check Ada you
 
03:26:50.950 --> 03:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
know compatibility they don't have to
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
review any of the engineering elements
 
03:26:57.950 --> 03:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
they can go straight to determining if
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
the unit meets the site requirements or
 
03:27:03.349 --> 03:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
the zoning dimensional requirements and
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
so that can cut a significant amount of
 
03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
time off this if you start seeing 10 20
 
03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
38 views a month which
 
03:27:14.450 --> 03:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
you know uh in my mind is probably a
 
03:27:16.849 --> 03:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
place we want to get to we probably want
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
to get to a place where municipalities
 
03:27:20.690 --> 03:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
are approving dozens of these you know
 
03:27:23.450 --> 03:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
if not over a hundred a year if we can
 
03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
get to that place we can put a
 
03:27:27.530 --> 03:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
meaningful dent in housing demand
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
so for this one there is no state level
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
example but Seattle is the best example
 
03:27:35.690 --> 03:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
of the three here and so we're going to
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
so Seattle Washington is an interesting
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
case study because uh it was split about
 
03:27:49.370 --> 03:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
50 50 down the middle about whether the
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
population wanted a to use or didn't
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
want adus really half the population was
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
I don't want those in my backyard and I
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
want them in this neighborhood they're
 
03:28:00.290 --> 03:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
going to cause traffic congestion
 
03:28:02.090 --> 03:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
they're going to take parking you know
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
all the typical things we hear about
 
03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
growth you know that people are
 
03:28:09.050 --> 03:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
concerned about some legitimate and some
 
03:28:10.969 --> 03:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
maybe not but
 
03:28:12.650 --> 03:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
um but all of that was true in Seattle
 
03:28:15.170 --> 03:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
and so because of that the planning
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
department had to be very diligent about
 
03:28:17.279 --> 03:28:18.469 align:start position:0%
department had to be very diligent about
every

03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
step they took to facilitate policy so
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's not upset
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
anybody right like they really want to
 
03:28:28.969 --> 03:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
show the Merit of the process they
 
03:28:32.210 --> 03:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
followed in order to to not have people
 
03:28:36.530 --> 03:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
pick apart their their their efforts
 
03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
and so the way they did this uh once you
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
know the city kind of waffled back and
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
forth and then Washington State stepped
 
03:28:46.849 --> 03:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
in in the state passed a law it said
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
adus of the law of the land now so this
 
03:28:52.130 --> 03:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
is true in Seattle uh Washington in
 
03:28:53.650 --> 03:28:53.660 align:start position:0%
Oregon California
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
and a couple other states you know they
 
03:28:58.190 --> 03:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
basically say 80 user a Buy Right Use
 
03:29:00.349 --> 03:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
now so
 
03:29:02.750 --> 03:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
um so once that happened they got uh
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
Seattle started this process of putting
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
together information for the public to
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
use in
 
03:29:09.840 --> 03:29:10.490 align:start position:0%
use in
um

03:29:10.490 --> 03:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:12.889 --> 03:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
in developing or building their own edu
 
03:29:14.690 --> 03:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
and so they have a very thoughtful and
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
useful step-by-step guide for Adu
 
03:29:19.729 --> 03:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
production like what it what it what
 
03:29:21.530 --> 03:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
process do I need to follow in order to
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
do it and uh this represents a really
 
03:29:26.690 --> 03:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
well done technical assistance from the
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
within that
 
03:29:35.929 --> 03:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
um they have their pre-approved plan
 
03:29:39.490 --> 03:29:39.500 align:start position:0%
program and they have a library of over
 
03:29:43.610 --> 03:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
160 Adu plans but not all of them are
 
03:29:46.910 --> 03:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
pre-approved the the 160 plans came out
 
03:29:48.889 --> 03:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
of a solicitation process that was sent
 
03:29:52.190 --> 03:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
out to design professionals they said
 
03:29:54.530 --> 03:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
we would like to pre-approve a specific
 
03:29:56.929 --> 03:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
number of adus and we would like you to
 
03:29:58.969 --> 03:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
submit your plans and we will determine
 
03:30:01.969 --> 03:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
uh whether those plans uh are sort of
 
03:30:04.969 --> 03:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
the highest and best purpose for the
 
03:30:08.450 --> 03:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
Public's desires and so they set out
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
these criteria and uh the criteria was
 
03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
developed through a public survey so it
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't just the planning staff
 
03:30:16.849 --> 03:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
determining what was important in an Adu
 
03:30:19.969 --> 03:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
is let's go out and ask homeowners what
 
03:30:22.190 --> 03:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
they want in Adu renters what they want
 
03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
in Adu and then they develop the
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
criteria for the design professionals or
 
03:30:29.450 --> 03:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
respond to that they then said you can
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
respond on this submission but you have
 
03:30:33.530 --> 03:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
to pick a category you know is this Adu
 
03:30:35.870 --> 03:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to be green green building is it
 
03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to be affordable is it going to be
 
03:30:40.250 --> 03:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
flexible future use you have to
 
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
determine which one of these you're
 
03:30:44.870 --> 03:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're submitting your plan under
 
03:30:44.880 --> 03:30:45.830 align:start position:0%
you're submitting your plan under
um

03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
and then they had a panel to review all
 
03:30:50.450 --> 03:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
the plans that came in and they selected
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
the 12 best plans and they put those in
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
for the pre-approval process so it's
 
03:30:58.729 --> 03:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
very useful way to limit the scope of
 
03:31:00.410 --> 03:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
work that the staff had to do to review
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
and get these plans ready for the public
 
03:31:04.849 --> 03:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
consumption but also everything's
 
03:31:06.530 --> 03:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
transparent the whole process they use
 
03:31:08.809 --> 03:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
the survey results from the public the
 
03:31:10.849 --> 03:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
decision making and scoring process for
 
03:31:12.889 --> 03:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
the plans that were awarded the fact
 
03:31:14.330 --> 03:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
that all the plans that were submitted
 
03:31:16.250 --> 03:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
can be downloaded and the plans reviewed
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
and looked at by the public
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
in all of this really serves to
 
03:31:23.929 --> 03:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
instigate discussion amongst the public
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
about what is important in housing
 
03:31:29.389 --> 03:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
around adus
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
part of how this program functions now
 
03:31:33.530 --> 03:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
that this library of 12 units is in
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
place is that the designer of the unit
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
gets to charge a fee if a homeowner
 
03:31:45.650 --> 03:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
chooses to build using those plans and
 
03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
so uh there's a license fee on the web
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
for for using the the plan available on
 
03:31:54.229 --> 03:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
the web page and the license fee is
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
important because it establish an
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
engagement between the homeowner and the
 
03:32:03.889 --> 03:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
for for every homeowner that thinks they
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
want to use a pre-approved plan then
 
03:32:10.370 --> 03:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
comes along some idea about how they
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
want to change it they want to move a
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
door here they want to change a wall
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
here they want to push something out
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
three feet over there well when that
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
happens it's no longer a proof plan they
 
03:32:21.170 --> 03:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
need a design professional to bring that
 
03:32:25.790 --> 03:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
plan into into compliance right so uh so
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
it builds a relationship where the
 
03:32:29.450 --> 03:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
design professional can modify those
 
03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
plans and then go through the
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
traditional approval process if desired
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
or if the homeowner just uses the plans
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
as designed they might want a a
 
03:32:40.849 --> 03:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
construction representative a
 
03:32:43.010 --> 03:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
homeowner's rep an owner's rep during
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
construction and so they would hire that
 
03:32:46.610 --> 03:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
architect who designed those plans
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
probably knows them well it's probably
 
03:32:49.729 --> 03:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
overseen the construction of multiple
 
03:32:52.370 --> 03:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
iterations of that plan to then oversee
 
03:32:53.929 --> 03:32:53.939 align:start position:0%
construction on behalf of the homeowner
 
03:32:55.610 --> 03:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
and protect them from risk involved with
 
03:32:55.620 --> 03:32:57.530 align:start position:0%
and protect them from risk involved with
construction

03:32:57.530 --> 03:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
construction
 
03:33:00.769 --> 03:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
uh on the designer side they get to
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
retain ownership of this plan and so uh
 
03:33:07.490 --> 03:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
what we found in the research is and you
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
know bear with me this is very Pacific
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
Northwest so this doesn't look like New
 
03:33:13.250 --> 03:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
England architecture but um what happens
 
03:33:16.130 --> 03:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
is because the owner uh the architect or
 
03:33:17.570 --> 03:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
the design professional retains
 
03:33:19.870 --> 03:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
ownership of these plans they're really
 
03:33:22.969 --> 03:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
incentivized to put forward the most
 
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
effective product to lure homeowners to
 
03:33:29.870 --> 03:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
use their plan and it again it plays two
 
03:33:31.729 --> 03:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
incentives and so what we're looking at
 
03:33:33.889 --> 03:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
here is three of the 12 plans that are
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
pre-approved in Seattle uh one's a small
 
03:33:39.889 --> 03:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
cottage one's a two bed two bath so
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial size uh larger than
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
than most towns allow in New Hampshire
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
at a thousand square feet and then
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:54.050 --> 03:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
um again all these plans are available
 
03:33:55.969 --> 03:33:55.979 align:start position:0%
on the website but I thought it would be
 
03:33:57.530 --> 03:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
valuable to show you this image because
 
03:33:58.910 --> 03:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
then you get a sense of the level of
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
quality that went into these what we saw
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
from Chico and Eugene is that when you
 
03:34:05.330 --> 03:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't use a solicitation process and you
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
hire a design professional or you have
 
03:34:10.250 --> 03:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
in-house staff do it the quality of the
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
pre-approved plan is not nearly as uh as
 
03:34:15.889 --> 03:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
nice as this and you don't get as good a
 
03:34:18.650 --> 03:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
product and it doesn't instigate as much
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
participation from the public in
 
03:34:23.330 --> 03:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:25.010 --> 03:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
some other quick notes about Seattle
 
03:34:27.650 --> 03:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
they have a really nice online map you
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
can use to look through and see if you
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
meet all the requirements and where you
 
03:34:33.710 --> 03:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
might have uh
 
03:34:35.809 --> 03:34:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh you might get flagged for additional
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
review as a really effective tool
 
03:34:41.389 --> 03:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh I don't show all of it here but I
 
03:34:43.130 --> 03:34:43.140 align:start position:0%
highly recommend checking this out you
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
go to their ad Universe web page and you
 
03:34:47.389 --> 03:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
can scroll around this map if you want
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
to check it out it is it is a real it's
 
03:34:52.849 --> 03:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
real fun to use you just pick any random
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
house and say oh would it would nadieu
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:00.290 --> 03:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
they also have all the rules around you
 
03:35:02.090 --> 03:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
to use on this webpage easy to reference
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go digging through the
 
03:35:06.650 --> 03:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know some deep into some web portal
 
03:35:08.809 --> 03:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
to find the regulations on adus you can
 
03:35:11.330 --> 03:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
do it right from the single web page
 
03:35:13.490 --> 03:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
what else uh do they do here they track
 
03:35:15.889 --> 03:35:15.899 align:start position:0%
data just like we saw from California's
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh planning department they track all
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
the permitting in all the applications
 
03:35:23.809 --> 03:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
and who's living in these things what
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
kind of households and serving how it's
 
03:35:27.650 --> 03:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
affecting the housing market in Seattle
 
03:35:31.010 --> 03:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
how it's impacting other resources that
 
03:35:33.530 --> 03:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
go into housing it's really useful they
 
03:35:35.570 --> 03:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
then on an annual basis put this
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
together in a report that they give to
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
government officials that are
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for policy making to guide
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
their guide their decision around future
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
policy or amendments
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:52.490 --> 03:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
one last key you know I don't know if
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
you guys have any questions about your
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
scene here but uh we'll give one last
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
case study and then we can talk about
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
identified tools and techniques
 
03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
all right I'll go through this real
 
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
quick because it's it's probably less
 
03:36:03.710 --> 03:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
relevant to
 
03:36:06.650 --> 03:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
what you're doing at the state level
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
so in Los Angeles there's a small
 
03:36:11.690 --> 03:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in the Northeast and
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's this group called Lamas and
 
03:36:15.170 --> 03:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
there are community
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
a community design organization so what
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
what what's a community design
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
organization they uh they are basically
 
03:36:25.130 --> 03:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
a non-profit that lends help to
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
community residents in solving issues
 
03:36:29.809 --> 03:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
around design could be with their
 
03:36:32.090 --> 03:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
property uh could be with the Civic
 
03:36:35.090 --> 03:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
realm so Street design or you know could
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
be with how to uh manage storefronts in
 
03:36:39.889 --> 03:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
a little Village Center or something
 
03:36:42.349 --> 03:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
like that and so they they can do all
 
03:36:44.809 --> 03:36:44.819 align:start position:0%
these things as a design center at as a
 
03:36:44.819 --> 03:36:46.490 align:start position:0%
these things as a design center at as a
non-profit

03:36:46.490 --> 03:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
Lamas worked with elected officials to
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
create an Adu pilot project to
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the ways to meet the
 
03:36:56.750 --> 03:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
community needs through adus as an
 
03:36:58.490 --> 03:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
affordable housing option
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
and they selected a couple of a
 
03:37:01.849 --> 03:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
household to participate in this pilot
 
03:37:04.130 --> 03:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
project and designed a two-bedroom Adu
 
03:37:05.929 --> 03:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
with an attached garage to serve the
 
03:37:08.809 --> 03:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
needs of that selected homeowner so here
 
03:37:10.370 --> 03:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
on the right we have kind of a fun
 
03:37:13.130 --> 03:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
little image shows you know uh sort of
 
03:37:13.140 --> 03:37:14.650 align:start position:0%
little image shows you know uh sort of
conceptual

03:37:14.650 --> 03:37:14.660 align:start position:0%
conceptual
 
03:37:16.729 --> 03:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
visualization of what this thing would
 
03:37:20.210 --> 03:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
look like and on the next slide well we
 
03:37:23.330 --> 03:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
can uh we talked they just the hitting
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
the bullets here the three things they
 
03:37:27.190 --> 03:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
really wanted to demonstrate was
 
03:37:29.630 --> 03:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
well-designed home in a low cost
 
03:37:32.690 --> 03:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
the ability to finance adus
 
03:37:34.490 --> 03:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
and how government can play a role in
 
03:37:36.650 --> 03:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
making it easier to build them so all
 
03:37:38.269 --> 03:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
three of these things were
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is this Project's pretty old now so
 
03:37:42.590 --> 03:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
this is from years ago but it is a
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
useful uh example of how non-profits can
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
play a role in facilitating government
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh action on easing housing needs
 
03:37:56.269 --> 03:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
and so uh so in this next slide there's
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
a floor plans on the left is this first
 
03:38:00.050 --> 03:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
floor you can see the car in the garage
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
and there's kind of a shared kitchen
 
03:38:03.889 --> 03:38:03.899 align:start position:0%
living room and an open space and a
 
03:38:06.290 --> 03:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
stairwell in between those two spaces
 
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
in the Upper Floor you have two bedrooms
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
and a small bathroom and laundry area
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
what they built pretty much is Verbatim
 
03:38:17.870 --> 03:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
what they had in the concept and uh the
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
design is quality and I think I think
 
03:38:22.250 --> 03:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
you know this is very much Los Angeles
 
03:38:26.469 --> 03:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
architecture you know uh like Southern
 
03:38:29.170 --> 03:38:29.180 align:start position:0%
uh Craftsman style architecture
 
03:38:32.210 --> 03:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
reimagined but but it's it's playful and
 
03:38:33.889 --> 03:38:33.899 align:start position:0%
fun and the architecture is inspiring
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
and the building is beautiful and uh I
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to include this case study
 
03:38:42.110 --> 03:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
because I I firmly believe that a lot of
 
03:38:44.570 --> 03:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
the rejection we get in in New Hampshire
 
03:38:48.290 --> 03:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
and Society of uh growth is the ugliness
 
03:38:50.809 --> 03:38:50.819 align:start position:0%
of growth and so I think if we can solve
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
some of that right if we cannot build
 
03:38:55.070 --> 03:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
ugly buildings uh people would be a lot
 
03:38:58.870 --> 03:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
less hesitant to support growth so
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh they were very successful with this
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
pilot it inspired elected officials to
 
03:39:05.690 --> 03:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
want to work with them and inspired the
 
03:39:07.490 --> 03:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
non-profit to want to think bigger about
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
how they could scale this up and they
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
came up with this program called the
 
03:39:13.190 --> 03:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
backyard homes project where they
 
03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
developed a series of different plans
 
03:39:17.809 --> 03:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
that the public you know the residents
 
03:39:20.809 --> 03:39:20.819 align:start position:0%
of Northeast La could use uh as a basis
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
point for designing an Adu and then they
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
worked to partner the homeowner with a
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
with a low-income tenant and then
 
03:39:31.130 --> 03:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
facilitate the use of Hud funding to
 
03:39:33.769 --> 03:39:33.779 align:start position:0%
build the Adu so it's a very creative
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
program and uh it's linked in here and
 
03:39:37.969 --> 03:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
you'll find it in the report but they
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
they put together all these resources
 
03:39:42.769 --> 03:39:42.779 align:start position:0%
including a project road map and a
 
03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
detailed program booklet and an
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
information sheet to show homeowners how
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
to go through this process and if the
 
03:39:52.370 --> 03:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
homeowner want to do it this uh non this
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
community Design Group would would walk
 
03:39:59.809 --> 03:39:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
so uh we don't get in we don't have to
 
03:40:03.769 --> 03:40:03.779 align:start position:0%
get into all this but
 
03:40:03.779 --> 03:40:04.370 align:start position:0%
get into all this but
um

03:40:04.370 --> 03:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:07.130 --> 03:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
Lamaze the the mission of Lamaze was
 
03:40:08.929 --> 03:40:08.939 align:start position:0%
very much neighborhood Focus
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
and this program was so successful it
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
outgrew the neighborhood into the
 
03:40:16.190 --> 03:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
regional level and so as a result of
 
03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:17.090 align:start position:0%
regional level and so as a result of
that

03:40:17.090 --> 03:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
um this program spun off into something
 
03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
called office of office and so it's it's
 
03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
a little less pertinent to what we're
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
talking about but uh it's worth noting
 
03:40:25.739 --> 03:40:27.170 align:start position:0%
talking about but uh it's worth noting
that

03:40:27.170 --> 03:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know these things are organic and if
 
03:40:32.570 --> 03:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
with success they morph and meet the
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
needs so
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
all right so we've got tools and
 
03:40:39.950 --> 03:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
techniques we identified five the first
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
three were where we started we started
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
this initial research looking at
 
03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
affordability calling Financial
 
03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
incentives here uh pre-approved Adu
 
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
plans and then design initiatives so
 
03:40:53.210 --> 03:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
things like design competitions
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
Community technical assistance
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
and then what we found is that in most
 
03:41:01.490 --> 03:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
of these case studies the there was this
 
03:41:03.530 --> 03:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
momentum building that went along with
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
these things and that initiated with
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
liberalizing of ADA regulations and or
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
the process of approval
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
as an initial step and then staff and
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
other groups stepped in to provide
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
technical assistance Outreach and
 
03:41:19.729 --> 03:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
education of the public and those things
 
03:41:22.250 --> 03:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
built momentum to do the things we saw
 
03:41:24.050 --> 03:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
on the first three panels This
 
03:41:26.090 --> 03:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
affordability pre-approved plans and
 
03:41:28.010 --> 03:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
design initiatives
 
03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
so we reorganized this based on uh level
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
of effort we think needs to go into it
 
03:41:37.490 --> 03:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
in order to implement and so all the way
 
03:41:39.650 --> 03:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
on the left we've reorganized technical
 
03:41:41.150 --> 03:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
assistance as the first thing it's an
 
03:41:44.090 --> 03:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
easy lift staff can usually do technical
 
03:41:46.370 --> 03:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
assistance to help homeowners build an
 
03:41:50.450 --> 03:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
Adu for very little or no cost might
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
cost some of their time but they can do
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
these things so that looks like
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
permitting and approval Assistance or
 
03:41:59.090 --> 03:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
one-on-one assistance creating an Adu
 
03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
checklist for homeowners to use or
 
03:42:02.990 --> 03:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
holding informal homeowner workshops
 
03:42:04.610 --> 03:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
where they can ask questions in a
 
03:42:06.410 --> 03:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
hypothetical basis without having to put
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
together a formalized review
 
03:42:10.370 --> 03:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
then things kind of build from there you
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
can do Outreach and education you could
 
03:42:13.969 --> 03:42:13.979 align:start position:0%
hire media firms to help you put
 
03:42:17.330 --> 03:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
together informational videos then if uh
 
03:42:19.130 --> 03:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
if you want to go further you can look
 
03:42:20.809 --> 03:42:20.819 align:start position:0%
at design initiatives you can hold an
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
Adu design competition you could build a
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
pilot project things start to get more
 
03:42:28.510 --> 03:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
expensive require more time and energy
 
03:42:31.370 --> 03:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
you can put together a pre-approved Adu
 
03:42:32.830 --> 03:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
plans library
 
03:42:35.870 --> 03:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
and my recommendation was you use a
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
solicitation process to do that don't
 
03:42:40.250 --> 03:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
hire a design professional through a
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
contract so that you get the best
 
03:42:43.610 --> 03:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
quality product
 
03:42:45.769 --> 03:42:45.779 align:start position:0%
and then finally we can look at
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
providing affordability incentives
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
things like loans and grants to support
 
03:42:55.070 --> 03:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:57.769 --> 03:42:57.779 align:start position:0%
with all these tools identified we ran
 
03:42:59.929 --> 03:42:59.939 align:start position:0%
them across the case studies and
 
03:43:01.969 --> 03:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
categorized them so it's a little hard
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
to read at the scale so I apologize but
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'll send you a slide set and you can
 
03:43:08.750 --> 03:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
look at more detail this also was given
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the executive summary and is an easy
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
to use reference guide for looking at
 
03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
particular types of approaches to
 
03:43:19.490 --> 03:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
incentivizing or supporting the
 
03:43:21.050 --> 03:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
production of adus
 
03:43:23.090 --> 03:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
so you can almost think of it as a
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
different type of table of contents and
 
03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
so across the top where you have nearly
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
every one of them has an X that's uh
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
reductions in zoning and then as we
 
03:43:33.889 --> 03:43:33.899 align:start position:0%
talked about easy lifts technical
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
assistance and then up to financial
 
03:43:38.690 --> 03:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
incentives you know requiring the most
 
03:43:42.530 --> 03:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
resources and buy-in the red X's are the
 
03:43:42.540 --> 03:43:43.729 align:start position:0%
resources and buy-in the red X's are the
initial

03:43:43.729 --> 03:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
initial
 
03:43:48.590 --> 03:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh Focus area of research for that
 
03:43:50.630 --> 03:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
particular case study so Barnstable Mass
 
03:43:52.849 --> 03:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
we're looking at affordability for
 
03:43:54.830 --> 03:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
constructing adus
 
03:43:56.450 --> 03:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
California we were looking at
 
03:43:58.370 --> 03:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
affordability around permitting and
 
03:44:00.769 --> 03:44:00.779 align:start position:0%
approval of adus and so on kind of
 
03:44:04.610 --> 03:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:06.650 --> 03:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
so we've covered the tools and
 
03:44:06.660 --> 03:44:07.969 align:start position:0%
so we've covered the tools and
techniques

03:44:07.969 --> 03:44:07.979 align:start position:0%
techniques
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
we've talked about the case studies and
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is run through three
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
scenarios and one bonus scenario and
 
03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's all I got I used my whole 45
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
minutes so I apologize I'll go through
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
this real quick
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
couple scenarios for how New Hampshire
 
03:44:24.849 --> 03:44:24.859 align:start position:0%
can translate this Research into
 
03:44:27.889 --> 03:44:27.899 align:start position:0%
models of production so this first one
 
03:44:30.170 --> 03:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
and I cut out there's a couple other
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
ones we did here that were at the
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
municipal scale and even bother showing
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
those because you guys are really
 
03:44:37.250 --> 03:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
focused on state level stuff all right
 
03:44:39.610 --> 03:44:39.620 align:start position:0%
so so this first one is a regional level
 
03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
Adu Library so a lot of small towns
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to put together
 
03:44:47.630 --> 03:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
pre-approved plans right but when you
 
03:44:49.070 --> 03:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
collect those all together under a
 
03:44:51.050 --> 03:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission now you can
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
do something you can get a dozen towns
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
to all have the same pre-approved plan
 
03:44:58.130 --> 03:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
on their books and the Planning
 
03:45:00.290 --> 03:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
Commission can manage that Library
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
so uh to do this the the regional
 
03:45:05.929 --> 03:45:05.939 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission would work with the
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
town to collaborate on what criteria
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
they want to set first for developing
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
plans the the Planning Commission would
 
03:45:15.050 --> 03:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
do the solicitation process the survey
 
03:45:17.809 --> 03:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
of residence and
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
um the Planning Commission would work
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
with the local officials to determine
 
03:45:23.570 --> 03:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
what content needs to be in those plans
 
03:45:26.929 --> 03:45:26.939 align:start position:0%
in order for them to be pre-approved
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then finally the Planning Commission
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
would maintain the library over time it
 
03:45:32.929 --> 03:45:32.939 align:start position:0%
might need periodic updating let's say
 
03:45:35.210 --> 03:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
the state changes their zoning code now
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
as plans need to be rechecked against
 
03:45:38.510 --> 03:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
new zoning code they might need some
 
03:45:40.610 --> 03:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
minor modifications
 
03:45:42.530 --> 03:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
so that's scenario a
 
03:45:45.229 --> 03:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
scenario B zero interest deferred loans
 
03:45:46.429 --> 03:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk about this in the
 
03:45:48.110 --> 03:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
affordability component but Barnstable
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
and Boston both have zero interest
 
03:45:52.370 --> 03:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
deferred loan programs and they're both
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
a little different ones targeted at rent
 
03:45:57.469 --> 03:45:57.479 align:start position:0%
affordability for renters and ones are
 
03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
targeted at affordability for the
 
03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
homeowner and so
 
03:46:03.170 --> 03:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire can replicate
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
either of those programs it can put
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
together uh requirements for
 
03:46:08.399 --> 03:46:08.990 align:start position:0%
together uh requirements for
um

03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:12.170 --> 03:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
based on income limitations
 
03:46:12.180 --> 03:46:13.370 align:start position:0%
based on income limitations
um

03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
to in order to support affordable
 
03:46:18.290 --> 03:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
housing unit production as adus
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
the the one thing about this is that uh
 
03:46:23.450 --> 03:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
it initially requires a lot of
 
03:46:25.130 --> 03:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
capitalization just like a small
 
03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
business loan fund or any kind of uh
 
03:46:29.570 --> 03:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Loan Fund that you might see
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level it requires a big
 
03:46:33.290 --> 03:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
chunk of money up front to get it going
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then it can kind of feed off of
 
03:46:35.040 --> 03:46:36.590 align:start position:0%
and then it can kind of feed off of
itself

03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:46:38.690 --> 03:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
scenario C do what California did
 
03:46:41.570 --> 03:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
develop a pre-approved pre-development
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
Grant give homeowners forty thousand
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
dollars if they income qualify if you
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
size that at four million dollars in New
 
03:46:49.969 --> 03:46:49.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you'd be able to build 180 to
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
use and they would come real quick you
 
03:46:54.769 --> 03:46:54.779 align:start position:0%
know do you build 180 Us in less than a
 
03:46:58.010 --> 03:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
year it's basically how that would go
 
03:47:00.050 --> 03:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
um it's just a way to jump start and
 
03:47:02.030 --> 03:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
normalize Adu production help businesses
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
get off their feet help the industry
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
figure out how to finance them get
 
03:47:08.210 --> 03:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
things moving once they're moving
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
people send to accept it and it should
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is a bonus uh here this one last
 
03:47:19.610 --> 03:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
one what's possible there's this really
 
03:47:22.190 --> 03:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
cool program out of Portland Oregon uh
 
03:47:24.170 --> 03:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
Hacienda CDC which is Community
 
03:47:25.849 --> 03:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
Development Corporation led a pilot
 
03:47:28.910 --> 03:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
projected to demonstrate how to build at
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
scale modular housing units uh not
 
03:47:33.950 --> 03:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
specifically as adus but I think they
 
03:47:37.729 --> 03:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
would make great adus uh and the state
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
provided 5 million in funding to support
 
03:47:42.650 --> 03:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
this initial pilot production and that
 
03:47:44.690 --> 03:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
translated into a 44 million dollar
 
03:47:48.290 --> 03:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
Grant from Eda to grow an emerging
 
03:47:50.809 --> 03:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
market around Timber Products and what's
 
03:47:52.490 --> 03:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
so unique about this is they build this
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
with uh like a cross laminated Timber or
 
03:47:57.650 --> 03:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
a wood Mass wall so the wall is solid
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
wood and the whole way across its panel
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
like a giant thick piece of plywood and
 
03:48:03.530 --> 03:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
you'd think well that doesn't seem very
 
03:48:06.170 --> 03:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
efficient but the thing is uh for
 
03:48:07.849 --> 03:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
whatever reason in Oregon they have a
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
lot of byproduct trees Timber that is
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
not suitable as Lumber stock two by
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
fours you know four by Eights things
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
like that and so the product doesn't
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
have a high use value proposal outside
 
03:48:22.130 --> 03:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
of Home Depot so what do they do they
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
turn it into this panel and they're
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
building local housing products out of
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
it so it's really really interesting
 
03:48:28.680 --> 03:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
it so it's really really interesting
um innovation

03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
um innovation
 
03:48:31.849 --> 03:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
and so New Hampshire could do something
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
like this they could build six prototype
 
03:48:35.690 --> 03:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
units with some Innovative Building
 
03:48:37.969 --> 03:48:37.979 align:start position:0%
Technology maybe work with UNH to
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
determine what that is uh provide these
 
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
projects uh through design construction
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
delivery and field monitoring and then
 
03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:47.929 align:start position:0%
delivery and field monitoring and then
um

03:48:47.929 --> 03:48:47.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps maybe that would scale
 
03:48:54.170 --> 03:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
into a larger production year over year
 
03:48:56.150 --> 03:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
drop the cost of these things and then
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
become Market viable on their own so I
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
apologize I went like really long really
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
fast but that is that's all the content
 
03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
I have for you
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's been that's been
 
03:49:09.170 --> 03:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
helpful so we hear about adus I think
 
03:49:10.370 --> 03:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
the most helpful part was the beginning
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
where you told us recommended changes
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:49:15.769 --> 03:49:15.779 align:start position:0%
um it's given me a lot to think about I
 
03:49:17.330 --> 03:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
don't know about the rest of us
 
03:49:19.969 --> 03:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions for Mr Bale
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
03:49:26.150 --> 03:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
question it is getting back to the
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of it with recommended changes
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh you were talking about a proposal to
 
03:49:33.889 --> 03:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
make them buy right so people wouldn't
 
03:49:36.769 --> 03:49:36.779 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to get surveys because
 
03:49:38.590 --> 03:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have a lot of money
 
03:49:41.150 --> 03:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
again you explained later where they're
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
going to get the money to build it if
 
03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
they don't even have the money for a
 
03:49:45.889 --> 03:49:45.899 align:start position:0%
survey would you recommend building
 
03:49:47.809 --> 03:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
anything on home
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
or a detached Adu if we went down that
 
03:49:50.399 --> 03:49:51.290 align:start position:0%
or a detached Adu if we went down that
road

03:49:51.290 --> 03:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
road
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
in a meets and Bounds State like New
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with Antiquated borders
 
03:49:58.969 --> 03:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
without a survey
 
03:50:01.729 --> 03:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
well buy right doesn't necessarily mean
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
that you would be able to build without
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
a survey although a survey does elevate
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
the cost you know the towns could set
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
that through their zoning what the
 
03:50:13.490 --> 03:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
requirements are for submitting an
 
03:50:15.650 --> 03:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
application and a survey could be one of
 
03:50:17.330 --> 03:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
the things they require as part of that
 
03:50:19.849 --> 03:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
application to build an EDU
 
03:50:23.450 --> 03:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be you know I
 
03:50:25.210 --> 03:50:25.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require more than a plot plan
 
03:50:28.130 --> 03:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
and that the owner certified that the
 
03:50:31.130 --> 03:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
plot plan is accurate uh and this is in
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
the 80s is how a lot of single-family
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
homes were built including my own
 
03:50:37.610 --> 03:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe we've moved past as a
 
03:50:40.190 --> 03:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
society and we can't go back there but
 
03:50:40.200 --> 03:50:40.969 align:start position:0%
society and we can't go back there but
um

03:50:40.969 --> 03:50:40.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
I know when I wanted to build Adu on my
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
property I had to pay two thousand
 
03:50:47.090 --> 03:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
dollars to get a survey done not the end
 
03:50:49.070 --> 03:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the world but
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
um you know it was it's a cost
 
03:50:55.490 --> 03:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead follow up and again I'm just
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
being realistic about this surveys are
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
critical for an example you referenced
 
03:51:02.570 --> 03:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
your home cost me six thousand dollars
 
03:51:04.429 --> 03:51:04.439 align:start position:0%
to find out that my plot plan didn't
 
03:51:08.530 --> 03:51:08.540 align:start position:0%
match the survey so thank you
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:17.269 align:start position:0%
uh representative
yes

03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:20.090 --> 03:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
you do not
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question regarding
 
03:51:25.010 --> 03:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
um off-street parking regulations do you
 
03:51:25.020 --> 03:51:26.389 align:start position:0%
um off-street parking regulations do you
know

03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:51:26.399 --> 03:51:27.590 align:start position:0%
know
um

03:51:27.590 --> 03:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
how many Municipal not how many but like
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
how often that's used as a as a
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
hindrance to building adus in New
 
03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I mean my what I'm
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
thinking something realistic is saying
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
like you can require up to one parking
 
03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
spot per bedroom or something I'm trying
 
03:51:46.370 --> 03:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
to think of like something that's
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
realistic that can accommodate but also
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
be like all right you can't set like
 
03:51:53.450 --> 03:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
four parking spots per one bedroom Adu
 
03:51:58.610 --> 03:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
yeah one per driver yeah they may not be
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
driving any longer yeah yeah I I think
 
03:52:06.769 --> 03:52:06.779 align:start position:0%
the idea of you know requiring one per
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
bedroom is uh within totally within the
 
03:52:10.969 --> 03:52:10.979 align:start position:0%
realm of reason
 
03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I live in the city of
 
03:52:13.560 --> 03:52:14.990 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I live in the city of
Manchester

03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
we we allow overnight on street parking
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
on street and most of our streets have
 
03:52:23.330 --> 03:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
plenty of capacity to uh manage that
 
03:52:26.450 --> 03:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
kind of cars on the street especially in
 
03:52:27.889 --> 03:52:27.899 align:start position:0%
single-family neighborhoods there's
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
plenty of room for cars on the road
 
03:52:30.720 --> 03:52:31.429 align:start position:0%
plenty of room for cars on the road
um

03:52:31.429 --> 03:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
the the reason why I bring it up for
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester up is
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the housing that exists has
 
03:52:40.969 --> 03:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
a long skinny driveway to a carriage
 
03:52:42.590 --> 03:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
house in the back right so you have this
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
you have a lot maybe it's 50 feet wide
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
the house is taking up 30 feet you get a
 
03:52:48.170 --> 03:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
driveway 12 feet you're pretty much
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
there right if you then go say you can
 
03:52:52.010 --> 03:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
only build an Adu if you add another
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
parking space it pretty much knocks all
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
of that housing type out of contention
 
03:52:59.210 --> 03:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
for building an Adu
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and like that's you know we we think
 
03:53:05.570 --> 03:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
like okay the car is an apple absolute
 
03:53:06.950 --> 03:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
requisite because we don't want to
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
create undue burden on the community but
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
in many scenarios that homeowner's not
 
03:53:13.130 --> 03:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
someone who drives in it might be
 
03:53:17.809 --> 03:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
grandma might be I don't know somebody
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's walking to work if they're in an
 
03:53:22.370 --> 03:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
inner Village and so I you know I think
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing as far as a state
 
03:53:27.229 --> 03:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
Max on uh requirements for parking makes
 
03:53:28.849 --> 03:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
sense and then it still leaves the
 
03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
flexibility for a place like Manchester
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
to determine when and where and how to
 
03:53:35.090 --> 03:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
require less parking if they want to do
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
that for example maybe it's on a high
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
frequency bus route for MTA and you can
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
get into the city now maybe if you look
 
03:53:44.510 --> 03:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
at La that's what they did they say if
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
you're on a Transit line you don't have
 
03:53:49.309 --> 03:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
a parking requirement so there's lots of
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
creative ways to do that okay
 
03:53:50.760 --> 03:53:52.429 align:start position:0%
creative ways to do that okay
representative

03:53:52.429 --> 03:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:53.690 --> 03:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
um you talked a little bit about these
 
03:53:56.040 --> 03:53:57.229 align:start position:0%
um you talked a little bit about these
different

03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:53:57.239 --> 03:53:58.190 align:start position:0%
different
um

03:53:58.190 --> 03:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
things that you were studying how you
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
some of them were uh you said old
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
um so like the California one
 
03:54:12.239 --> 03:54:13.070 align:start position:0%
um so like the California one
um

03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:16.010 --> 03:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
what what year was that and then is
 
03:54:19.490 --> 03:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
there what what other benefits I guess
 
03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
um have they seen so they put you know
 
03:54:26.330 --> 03:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
the they spent the 100 million dollars
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
and you're talking about like hey maybe
 
03:54:32.210 --> 03:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
there's an industry that makes it market
 
03:54:34.370 --> 03:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
rate or whatever has there been enough
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
time to see if that um those twenty
 
03:54:41.630 --> 03:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
thousand adus are repeated did that drop
 
03:54:44.090 --> 03:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
back down to five thousand by you know
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
three years later or is that up over
 
03:54:46.800 --> 03:54:47.929 align:start position:0%
three years later or is that up over
time

03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:54:49.849 --> 03:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:54:54.590 --> 03:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
the grant program was last year so uh so
 
03:54:56.570 --> 03:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
about March of last year that it went
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
out it was spent in four months it's
 
03:55:02.510 --> 03:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's done we will uh that like tracking
 
03:55:04.849 --> 03:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
of adus goes beyond the beginning of the
 
03:55:07.490 --> 03:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
grant program or or past you know back
 
03:55:09.889 --> 03:55:09.899 align:start position:0%
in time to 2018 far before they
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
implemented the grant uh and um
 
03:55:16.130 --> 03:55:16.140 align:start position:0%
California's planning department keeps
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
very good track of the permitting of
 
03:55:21.170 --> 03:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
these things and so I anticipate I don't
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
know that exists yet but I I anticipate
 
03:55:25.729 --> 03:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
they will do a pretty detailed analysis
 
03:55:28.130 --> 03:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
to determine the effect that Grant had
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
on production
 
03:55:32.809 --> 03:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
uh in general they have lots of research
 
03:55:35.809 --> 03:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
about Adu production in the state not
 
03:55:37.969 --> 03:55:37.979 align:start position:0%
not specifically about the grant but
 
03:55:40.969 --> 03:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you so that one's relatively
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
recent is there so maybe something that
 
03:55:50.570 --> 03:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
maybe has a little bit more of a history
 
03:55:54.410 --> 03:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
to it I know that that you know uh
 
03:55:54.420 --> 03:55:55.689 align:start position:0%
to it I know that that you know uh
Seattle

03:55:55.689 --> 03:55:55.699 align:start position:0%
Seattle
 
03:55:58.969 --> 03:55:58.979 align:start position:0%
just from living there I know that the
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
parking was a big it's a big issue We
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
complain about parking here it's not the
 
03:56:06.110 --> 03:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
same thing we don't have an issue with
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
parking in New Hampshire
 
03:56:11.689 --> 03:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
um Seattle definitely does
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
um more than than we do so I guess there
 
03:56:18.410 --> 03:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
do did they have additional restrictions
 
03:56:20.750 --> 03:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
kind of like we have in New Hampshire
 
03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:21.889 align:start position:0%
kind of like we have in New Hampshire
about

03:56:21.889 --> 03:56:21.899 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:56:25.250 --> 03:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
you know parking requirements and and
 
03:56:27.050 --> 03:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
setback requirements and those other
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
hurdles that we you know detach versus
 
03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:31.370 align:start position:0%
hurdles that we you know detach versus
and

03:56:31.370 --> 03:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
um attached that we have in New
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have placed on ourselves
 
03:56:39.410 --> 03:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
the legislature has placed on ourselves
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and do you see
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
any differences there
 
03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
03:56:46.260 --> 03:56:46.849 align:start position:0%
um as far as
um

03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
implementing any of those changes that
 
03:56:50.990 --> 03:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
we should probably fix some of those
 
03:56:53.630 --> 03:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
things first before we implement the
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
other things or
 
03:56:56.809 --> 03:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
um Do You See
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
some places had those restrictions
 
03:57:01.849 --> 03:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
someplace didn't and it didn't have
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
really that much effect on these these
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh different kind of plans that you're
 
03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
talking about here yeah I would in in
 
03:57:11.809 --> 03:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
several of the case studies uh in States
 
03:57:14.510 --> 03:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
so the state of Washington the state of
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
Oregon the state of California
 
03:57:16.680 --> 03:57:18.349 align:start position:0%
Oregon the state of California
I

03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh they've all passed regulations at the
 
03:57:24.410 --> 03:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
state level that forced the hand of
 
03:57:27.650 --> 03:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
these local local governing bodies and
 
03:57:30.050 --> 03:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
so they had choice either respond with
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
your regulation and and figure out how
 
03:57:33.590 --> 03:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
you want to manage these things within
 
03:57:35.450 --> 03:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
the framework of what the state's saying
 
03:57:36.889 --> 03:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
You must allow
 
03:57:38.809 --> 03:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
or don't take any action in the state's
 
03:57:42.530 --> 03:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
default language will take effect and so
 
03:57:45.469 --> 03:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
um everything within those locations
 
03:57:47.929 --> 03:57:47.939 align:start position:0%
cities within those locations is kind of
 
03:57:49.429 --> 03:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
a response to the state level
 
03:57:53.889 --> 03:57:53.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I didn't see it when
 
03:57:57.729 --> 03:57:57.739 align:start position:0%
you were going through all the examples
 
03:57:59.929 --> 03:57:59.939 align:start position:0%
because we've had
 
03:57:59.939 --> 03:58:00.710 align:start position:0%
because we've had
um

03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:03.170 --> 03:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
suggestions of going up to four adus I
 
03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
believe in a single family lot
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
what do these other examples
 
03:58:12.050 --> 03:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh you've shown us what are they doing
 
03:58:14.929 --> 03:58:14.939 align:start position:0%
are they one per or are they multiple
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
the 480 use it was it's a four plaques
 
03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
on a single family line whatever okay
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
whatever but but are they single
 
03:58:25.729 --> 03:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for that are they usually just
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
single adus on a single family building
 
03:58:32.689 --> 03:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
lot in in the state of California and in
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
the city of Seattle they allow two adus
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
and the differentiation is they allow
 
03:58:41.689 --> 03:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
one uh subordinate Adu within the home
 
03:58:44.030 --> 03:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
and then they allow a detached one
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
detection unit and
 
03:58:47.929 --> 03:58:47.939 align:start position:0%
um this is also found Texas I think
 
03:58:50.570 --> 03:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
Seattle and Houston do the same thing so
 
03:58:52.969 --> 03:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
but you know I don't do I recommend that
 
03:58:54.650 --> 03:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that's necessary I
 
03:58:55.790 --> 03:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
think we should just create as much
 
03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility as possible for one and then
 
03:59:01.729 --> 03:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
let it let it go let it grow
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
 
03:59:08.510 --> 03:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
presenting if you could send us that
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint that'd be very helpful for us
 
03:59:12.830 --> 03:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I can send you the special committee
 
03:59:15.650 --> 03:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
email to send that to us my pleasure and
 
03:59:17.210 --> 03:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh if you guys want any help crafting
 
03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
any kind of programs around New
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Adu regulation I'm more than
 
03:59:23.330 --> 03:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
happy to be a sort of a third party set
 
03:59:25.550 --> 03:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
of eyes to provide recommendations to
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
you guys around you know crafting any
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
kind of scope of work I have a feeling
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
there'll be a bill submitted
 
03:59:35.689 --> 03:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
on this stuff next year awesome thank
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
all right so I did want to have a mini
 
03:59:41.570 --> 03:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
work session at two o'clock but we have
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
half the committee here so I want to
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
have like a full committee thank you for
 
03:59:46.490 --> 03:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
coming representative Walsh
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate it so I want to schedule
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
something moving forward
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
um that will have hopefully the full
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
um that'll be like a few hours so we can
 
03:59:56.929 --> 03:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
hash it out all out
 
03:59:58.969 --> 03:59:58.979 align:start position:0%
um I know earlier today we represent
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
McConkey is going to work on some Des
 
04:00:03.530 --> 04:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
um rule making and recommendations for
 
04:00:03.540 --> 04:00:04.729 align:start position:0%
um rule making and recommendations for
that

04:00:04.729 --> 04:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
um but I I guess I kind of want to open
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
it up and see if there's any anybody
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
else that's looking at anything
 
04:00:09.479 --> 04:00:10.870 align:start position:0%
else that's looking at anything
particular

04:00:10.870 --> 04:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
I did watch the presentations this
 
04:00:13.199 --> 04:00:14.090 align:start position:0%
I did watch the presentations this
morning

04:00:14.090 --> 04:00:14.100 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and again I figured I could get here
 
04:00:18.229 --> 04:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
for the workshop I guess just in my
 
04:00:18.239 --> 04:00:19.250 align:start position:0%
for the workshop I guess just in my
opinion

04:00:19.250 --> 04:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:00:21.650 --> 04:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
I couldn't get to my phone for the first
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
one but both Joe Witcher and I think
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's Ron from Red Oak in my opinion were
 
04:00:29.630 --> 04:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
probably the most realistic testimony
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
that this committee has seen so I hope
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
we can look back at some of their
 
04:00:36.530 --> 04:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
suggestions in angles when we start
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
crafting some suggestions one I'll throw
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
out which Ron said and I believe it was
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
Ron Ray
 
04:00:46.370 --> 04:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
the fire department is the most powerful
 
04:00:47.809 --> 04:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
entity in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:00:49.490 --> 04:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
isn't this the truth
 
04:00:52.370 --> 04:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
so just throw this one out there the
 
04:00:53.809 --> 04:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
problem is it's called The Authority
 
04:00:56.210 --> 04:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
having jurisdiction which is within the
 
04:00:58.969 --> 04:00:58.979 align:start position:0%
fire codes which gives the chief or or
 
04:01:01.490 --> 04:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
designee in each municipality pretty
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
much fair rape or Fair ability to
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
interpret on a specific basis those
 
04:01:07.319 --> 04:01:08.389 align:start position:0%
interpret on a specific basis those
codes

04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
codes
 
04:01:10.969 --> 04:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
uh that's terrifying I mean where else
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
does a single person have that much
 
04:01:14.689 --> 04:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
power over everybody in the town and I
 
04:01:17.150 --> 04:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
can give you a dozen examples of
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
complaints even in my little town in the
 
04:01:22.250 --> 04:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
last five years and and so so throw this
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
up for an idea because we felt that the
 
04:01:27.170 --> 04:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
contractors were being treated unfairly
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
by the municipalities we created this
 
04:01:32.210 --> 04:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
thing called the housing appeals board
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we ought to give an angle to for
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
the same reason uh fire code appeals
 
04:01:39.889 --> 04:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
board it's just something to think about
 
04:01:43.370 --> 04:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
yeah uh that that some at some point
 
04:01:45.650 --> 04:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
with these fire codes and and the cost
 
04:01:47.809 --> 04:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
of them we've got to have some people
 
04:01:49.250 --> 04:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
just looking at these things and
 
04:01:52.189 --> 04:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
applying some common sense rather than
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
just having somebody with an interest
 
04:01:57.290 --> 04:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
saying no you need this I don't care how
 
04:01:59.150 --> 04:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
much it costs
 
04:02:01.370 --> 04:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great an excellent idea
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
I mean we were taught representative
 
04:02:05.150 --> 04:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
Wallace was talking about expanding his
 
04:02:06.950 --> 04:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
language but I think even having
 
04:02:08.570 --> 04:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
something separate that just deals with
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
that is good too yes I think it might be
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
smart to have a you know a two-pronged
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
approach if you will
 
04:02:15.170 --> 04:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
um the bill that we were discussing
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
earlier the the based on the
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the existing
 
04:02:22.130 --> 04:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
conditions at the time of issuance uh of
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
a building permit approval I think we
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
ought to name all the political
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
subdivisions as well as any
 
04:02:30.410 --> 04:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
um agency that may have any type of
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
authority over it I want to specifically
 
04:02:34.370 --> 04:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
name the fire department Health
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
Department uh State Fire Marshal's
 
04:02:38.689 --> 04:02:38.699 align:start position:0%
office we want to Reign we want to name
 
04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
them all in particular because as you
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
know if we're silent on that it's not
 
04:02:43.969 --> 04:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
included so we name every player that
 
04:02:45.530 --> 04:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
could be a roadblock for any kind of
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
development we put them all in there and
 
04:02:49.849 --> 04:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh and I think maybe we do the belt and
 
04:02:52.250 --> 04:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
suspenders approach and we also have a
 
04:02:56.290 --> 04:02:56.300 align:start position:0%
You Know PBS a philosophical BS a code
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
appeals board it could be anything
 
04:02:59.689 --> 04:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
anything goes
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
be it zoning fire
 
04:03:04.610 --> 04:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
um who knows you know Heritage
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
commission uh you know
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
rare insect uh Protection Bureau they
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
all got to be out of our way
 
04:03:17.689 --> 04:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
or representative yeah and thank you and
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
even if we have a pushback for growing
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
government if you will by creating
 
04:03:24.650 --> 04:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
another layer of bureaucracy uh I guess
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
as an ombudsman angle as well and so I
 
04:03:28.490 --> 04:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
mean there's a couple different ways to
 
04:03:30.969 --> 04:03:30.979 align:start position:0%
approach it just just to get more
 
04:03:33.950 --> 04:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
neutral eyes on some of these decisions
 
04:03:36.349 --> 04:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
that are be making been making by by our
 
04:03:36.359 --> 04:03:37.490 align:start position:0%
that are be making been making by by our
bureaucracies

04:03:37.490 --> 04:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies
 
04:03:39.889 --> 04:03:39.899 align:start position:0%
uh and just to clarify what was what my
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill was that representative McConkey
 
04:03:44.150 --> 04:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
was talking about this morning the
 
04:03:46.030 --> 04:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that was put on by the Senate
 
04:03:48.530 --> 04:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
basically what I've done with this bill
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
it puts it into I forget the RSA number
 
04:03:53.689 --> 04:03:53.699 align:start position:0%
now but it puts it right under Municipal
 
04:03:57.050 --> 04:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
I mean a single-family sprinklers in
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
other words it pulls sprinklers out of
 
04:04:00.889 --> 04:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
the codes and says no anything in the
 
04:04:02.450 --> 04:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
codes that says sprinklers doesn't apply
 
04:04:03.410 --> 04:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
I did the same thing with driveways and
 
04:04:08.090 --> 04:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that they put on merely
 
04:04:08.100 --> 04:04:09.769 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that they put on merely
said

04:04:09.769 --> 04:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:04:09.779 --> 04:04:10.550 align:start position:0%
said
um

04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
well I hope you still please listen to
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
us uh so I was okay with that and so I
 
04:04:17.689 --> 04:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
hopefully he concurs with it but but
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah at some point it's costing our
 
04:04:22.130 --> 04:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
citizens a fortune and unfairly we got
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
to get a hold on this so if we can
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
figure out a way like the housing
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
appeals board or the right to know
 
04:04:29.210 --> 04:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman to streamline the approach
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
where if a citizen feels agreed by this
 
04:04:35.330 --> 04:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
maybe they perceive egregious fire code
 
04:04:38.450 --> 04:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
buyer code rule they can go and be like
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is kind of absurd can you look at
 
04:04:42.769 --> 04:04:42.779 align:start position:0%
this and it would streamline it instead
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.969 --> 04:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
yeah not a bad idea I mean
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I kind of I'm not
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
sure that we need a whole separate
 
04:04:56.090 --> 04:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
appeals board I don't know why we
 
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't just expand the housing appeals
 
04:05:00.650 --> 04:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
board to be able to hear those cases
 
04:05:02.090 --> 04:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:05:02.100 --> 04:05:03.889 align:start position:0%
um but
but

04:05:03.889 --> 04:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm interested in kind of
 
04:05:07.680 --> 04:05:09.469 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm interested in kind of
um

04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:11.929 --> 04:05:11.939 align:start position:0%
you said representative McConkey is
 
04:05:14.929 --> 04:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
talking about trying to do something
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
um to
 
04:05:21.530 --> 04:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
I guess influence the rule making of Des
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how that is achieved
 
04:05:27.170 --> 04:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
without actual like just legislation
 
04:05:29.689 --> 04:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
that says that they have to consider X Y
 
04:05:32.090 --> 04:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
or Z or they have to do
 
04:05:33.769 --> 04:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
um you know something along those lines
 
04:05:37.010 --> 04:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how that is achieved but
 
04:05:41.090 --> 04:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm also interested in like how is this
 
04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
should this committee be
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
um like go like working with OLS or
 
04:05:51.530 --> 04:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
something on on drafting now because
 
04:05:53.570 --> 04:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
normally we're not allowed to really
 
04:05:55.729 --> 04:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
draft things outside of the normal draft
 
04:05:59.689 --> 04:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
time and so how is this committee going
 
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
to you know be drafting stuff getting it
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
printed and working on it kind of for
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
these work sessions or is it all going
 
04:06:07.490 --> 04:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
to be just like you know back of the
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
napkin kind of stuff until we go to OLS
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
um can you
 
04:06:15.050 --> 04:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
I suggest how we're gonna I don't know
 
04:06:17.090 --> 04:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
if we're allowed to maybe somebody else
 
04:06:18.650 --> 04:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
has more but I don't know if we're
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to buy are we allowed to buy a
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
language right now or we no no we can't
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
file anything drafts actually but as far
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
as the rule making process we've granted
 
04:06:30.849 --> 04:06:30.859 align:start position:0%
Des pretty wide authority to do that
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
however we can constrain the the depth
 
04:06:35.929 --> 04:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
and breadth of the rules that they make
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
by putting guardrails through the gel
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
car process and that's pretty
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
straightforward process
 
04:06:46.130 --> 04:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
sort of uh so you know we certainly can
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
do things like that
 
04:06:50.170 --> 04:06:50.180 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
04:06:52.429 --> 04:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
that's typically the solution when we
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
find an agency that is run amok and
 
04:06:56.450 --> 04:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
taken their Authority a bit too far will
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
say well you can make rules
 
04:07:00.889 --> 04:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
to this point but not Beyond
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question I think we
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
should have when we have the full
 
04:07:07.090 --> 04:07:07.100 align:start position:0%
committee work session give everybody
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
something to file with OLS
 
04:07:11.990 --> 04:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking maybe end of June have
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
something where we all have our mission
 
04:07:16.130 --> 04:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
of what to what to put in right you put
 
04:07:17.570 --> 04:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
in something regarding which I'm like
 
04:07:17.580 --> 04:07:21.349 align:start position:0%
in something regarding which I'm like
I'm

04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:22.969 --> 04:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some of the representatives are
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be like hey I want I you
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
know one of the things in this committee
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
that we really should do is get it
 
04:07:31.610 --> 04:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
nailed down like this is what the
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee kind of like likes as the idea
 
04:07:35.570 --> 04:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to do that without
 
04:07:38.150 --> 04:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually any language that we can
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
critique right if you you come in with
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
the draft from you know an Adu bill
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
from representative Reed
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
and and then you know representative
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
McConkey or or I have a criticism of it
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
like that the benefit of having this
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
committee and getting all of these
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
things that is getting that hashed out
 
04:07:59.570 --> 04:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
beforehand and not have it
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
um you know where they file it and then
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
it comes to this committee or it comes
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
to another committee and then they have
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
you know 15 different amendments and
 
04:08:08.210 --> 04:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
they dies because it's not ready for
 
04:08:11.030 --> 04:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
prime time I thought that a lot of this
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
committee was going to be
 
04:08:14.689 --> 04:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
you know helping get it to Prime Time
 
04:08:16.729 --> 04:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
now that we have a bunch of ideas like
 
04:08:19.130 --> 04:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
how do we get that language
 
04:08:19.140 --> 04:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
how do we get that language
um

04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:22.250 --> 04:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
kind of in draft form so that we can
 
04:08:24.290 --> 04:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
nitpick it and get it ready for prime
 
04:08:27.889 --> 04:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
time so for a filing with the rules with
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
OLS and stuff like that I I think that
 
04:08:31.550 --> 04:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to talk to the speaker
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
about like hey can we draft get get
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
approval for the committee to get some
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
things drafted maybe it's an amendment
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
to you know you know
 
04:08:48.530 --> 04:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
you know HB 1000 right and we're just
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
drafting some amendment that is not
 
04:08:53.450 --> 04:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
actually going to go anywhere but is
 
04:08:55.490 --> 04:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
able to be worked on while this
 
04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
committee is kind of in
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
you know maybe something that is
 
04:09:01.610 --> 04:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
retained or something right that we can
 
04:09:04.370 --> 04:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
like officially have this bill as the
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
thing that we can draft amendments to
 
04:09:08.929 --> 04:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
that we can work with OLS and get
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
something here for all the committee
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
members to critique
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
Kristen I have a question are we allowed
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
to get language drafted this summer or
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
that would be great I mean I have a bill
 
04:09:27.530 --> 04:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
in judiciary we could just like put some
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
stuff like find amendments to and stuff
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
to look at language but and exactly I
 
04:09:33.769 --> 04:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
think you know let's let's
 
04:09:36.110 --> 04:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
this the very special committee on
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
special committee on housing exists
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
because this is a critical issue at this
 
04:09:42.889 --> 04:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
point in time so that being said I don't
 
04:09:45.050 --> 04:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
think we should have to wait for the
 
04:09:46.610 --> 04:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
fall to start working on this
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's here we've been we've been
 
04:09:50.689 --> 04:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
fact-finding and listening and Gathering
 
04:09:52.130 --> 04:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
data at this point in time we've got
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
we've got some you know we've got a lot
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
of ideas flying around in this
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
brainstorming session let's get them
 
04:09:59.689 --> 04:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
down let's talk about amongst ourselves
 
04:10:01.309 --> 04:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
and then we can hit the ground running
 
04:10:03.170 --> 04:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
and not and like you say that's a great
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
idea we want to be ready come up OLS uh
 
04:10:09.290 --> 04:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know filing season in September
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have to then wait for it for
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
January for amending we've got this
 
04:10:15.769 --> 04:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
stuff worked out amongst us we take it
 
04:10:17.150 --> 04:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
and run it from there but we probably
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
will need the speaker's blessing yeah
 
04:10:20.110 --> 04:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
and we got to bring in probably David
 
04:10:22.610 --> 04:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
for a day like in August we could work
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
on it all day
 
04:10:26.689 --> 04:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
no that's not up to me we wouldn't mind
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Austin yeah just
 
04:10:28.920 --> 04:10:30.290 align:start position:0%
okay representative Austin yeah just
just

04:10:30.290 --> 04:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:10:32.269 --> 04:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
we do have an abundant amount of
 
04:10:34.010 --> 04:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
information I've been trying to keep
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
track with notes and things as we go
 
04:10:35.760 --> 04:10:37.370 align:start position:0%
track with notes and things as we go
along

04:10:37.370 --> 04:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
along
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
um just for trying to make this all work
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
I mean this committee I think should
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
kind of start with an outline whether
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's generated by you or staff or
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
whatever in a workshop add things to the
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
outline we need to prioritize and come
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
through a consensus of what we think we
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
even need to be moving forward with uh
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
because we could have come two
 
04:11:00.050 --> 04:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
completely ideas and of what you need to
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
do and if we don't have a consensus
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
we're just going to fight each other
 
04:11:06.050 --> 04:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to get accomplished I
 
04:11:07.550 --> 04:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
think there's plenty we found out that
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
we do agree on
 
04:11:11.090 --> 04:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
but we got to start someplace
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
um once we figure out what we're going
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
to concentrate on then I think it gets
 
04:11:16.729 --> 04:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
easier and the question gets easier to
 
04:11:18.290 --> 04:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
answer correct how we're going to do it
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
and if we can get some strong you know
 
04:11:22.610 --> 04:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
unanimous or pretty close to it
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee consensus that's going to send
 
04:11:27.769 --> 04:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
a very strong message in terms of filing
 
04:11:29.689 --> 04:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
in the fall too I think you can put 10
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on a bill that's right well
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the 10 people who might
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
be on this that would be the ideal is
 
04:11:37.309 --> 04:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
that all and it's kind of uh this is
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
we've done our research
 
04:11:40.250 --> 04:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:11:42.170 --> 04:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we kind of
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
talked about was this like pre
 
04:11:45.660 --> 04:11:47.570 align:start position:0%
talked about was this like pre
um

04:11:47.570 --> 04:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
um like off-site building of structures
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
or they were just talking about plans
 
04:11:57.729 --> 04:11:57.739 align:start position:0%
here today that were kind of like
 
04:12:00.530 --> 04:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
pre-approved at the you know county
 
04:12:04.610 --> 04:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
level or or got stamped automatically
 
04:12:06.410 --> 04:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
um they do that kind of stuff with the
 
04:12:09.050 --> 04:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
um especially you know at the federal
 
04:12:13.429 --> 04:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
level and maybe
 
04:12:13.439 --> 04:12:15.530 align:start position:0%
level and maybe
um

04:12:15.530 --> 04:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:18.650 --> 04:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
I am interested in one of the things
 
04:12:22.010 --> 04:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
um of having either empowering the
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
planning commissions or or even NH New
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like the New Hampshire uh what
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority or whatever I don't
 
04:12:36.050 --> 04:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
to come up with a place where we can
 
04:12:37.490 --> 04:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
have you know
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
um adus that are pre-approved or houses
 
04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
that are pre-approved this plan not the
 
04:12:45.110 --> 04:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
actual like site work and all of that
 
04:12:49.729 --> 04:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
stuff to to try and reduce the cost
 
04:12:52.729 --> 04:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
um of either design or like someone just
 
04:12:55.729 --> 04:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
wants to you know build a house and they
 
04:12:57.290 --> 04:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
you know are on a fixed budget they want
 
04:12:58.610 --> 04:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
to build it themselves or whatever they
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
just would take this plan off and as
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
long as they can reproduce that plan
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
congratulations that house is you know
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
they don't want to design anything right
 
04:13:10.910 --> 04:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
I think that going to the you know
 
04:13:13.370 --> 04:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
um local municipality with a Prius
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
stamped approved plan and you're just
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
gonna you know okay now I just have this
 
04:13:20.689 --> 04:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
square and I'm gonna have you know a
 
04:13:23.570 --> 04:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
plan for the you know the the foundation
 
04:13:25.610 --> 04:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
or whatever and that's the only thing
 
04:13:28.610 --> 04:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
that's really at contention at the local
 
04:13:30.769 --> 04:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
level I think that could speed up the
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
process and I I would like us to move
 
04:13:36.650 --> 04:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
um or consider that as something whether
 
04:13:38.689 --> 04:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
that be the off-site building like
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
pre-approval plans the 3D construction
 
04:13:44.030 --> 04:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
approval plans
 
04:13:46.490 --> 04:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
um uh or these Adu approval plans I
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
think all of those we could have like an
 
04:13:50.689 --> 04:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
um kind of a
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
a Rolodex of things that have been
 
04:13:54.889 --> 04:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
approved to help spring Streamlight the
 
04:13:57.290 --> 04:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
process so that the local municipalities
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't redoing the work every
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's so let's Center this to
 
04:14:05.450 --> 04:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
um Kristen can you take notes for this
 
04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
um could we just Center the specific
 
04:14:11.929 --> 04:14:11.939 align:start position:0%
issue areas that like broad surface
 
04:14:13.849 --> 04:14:13.859 align:start position:0%
level what we kind of wanna
 
04:14:16.610 --> 04:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
like let's start big and then go down so
 
04:14:18.050 --> 04:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking first
 
04:14:18.060 --> 04:14:20.269 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking first
adus

04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
adus
 
04:14:23.150 --> 04:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh do you have one
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
well I just mentioned my regulations one
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
with fire fire and all your other boards
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
that may affect boards or or
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies that may affect the
 
04:14:35.929 --> 04:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
decision-making process okay an appeals
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
process streamline cheap appeals process
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
streamlining appeals process for
 
04:14:42.239 --> 04:14:43.849 align:start position:0%
streamlining appeals process for
um

04:14:43.849 --> 04:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:45.650 --> 04:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
unfavorable decisions to the problem
 
04:14:50.050 --> 04:14:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.189 --> 04:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like housing appeals that's gonna
 
04:14:53.689 --> 04:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
that ought to help we know what that
 
04:14:53.699 --> 04:14:55.729 align:start position:0%
that ought to help we know what that
means

04:14:55.729 --> 04:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I already said one but I also
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
think that the um like des and their
 
04:15:08.330 --> 04:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
um I would say uh
 
04:15:13.309 --> 04:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
not uh not not taking into account
 
04:15:17.090 --> 04:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
um like the facts on the ground of what
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
house or the load that's going to be you
 
04:15:26.210 --> 04:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
know they're they're calculating 150
 
04:15:28.729 --> 04:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
gallons per day per bedroom
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that that is an art
 
04:15:37.450 --> 04:15:37.460 align:start position:0%
outdated arbitrary some some bad word
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
archaic you know a bunch of bad words
 
04:15:45.530 --> 04:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
um that we should we should um consider
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
um you know requiring Des to actually
 
04:15:49.849 --> 04:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
consider the things that are on the
 
04:15:51.410 --> 04:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
ground and not just some arbitrary
 
04:15:54.050 --> 04:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
number that they've put which may be you
 
04:15:56.929 --> 04:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
know in effect way before even low flow
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
toilets even existed
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
um also kind of like
 
04:16:03.000 --> 04:16:04.189 align:start position:0%
um also kind of like
um

04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:06.530 --> 04:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:16:06.540 --> 04:16:07.809 align:start position:0%
I think that
uh

04:16:07.809 --> 04:16:07.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:12.530 --> 04:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think DS uh
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
their answers were not
 
04:16:14.640 --> 04:16:15.349 align:start position:0%
their answers were not
um

04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say uh
 
04:16:20.809 --> 04:16:20.819 align:start position:0%
encouraging me that they are they are
 
04:16:20.819 --> 04:16:22.490 align:start position:0%
encouraging me that they are they are
flexible

04:16:22.490 --> 04:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
04:16:26.090 --> 04:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
um as far as what is
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
they they have they seem to just have a
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
rigid guideline of like this many
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
bedrooms we're going to approve four
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
bedrooms that's our standard like they
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
don't have what if you're building a
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom house why do you have to
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
build a four bedroom
 
04:16:40.319 --> 04:16:41.269 align:start position:0%
build a four bedroom
um

04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:45.410 --> 04:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh septic system a four bedroom minimum
 
04:16:47.389 --> 04:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
septic it just doesn't make any sense so
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
I think that we should look into so some
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
way to allow for more flexibility yeah
 
04:16:53.150 --> 04:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
if you if you want to build a
 
04:16:55.370 --> 04:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom septic system and you're
 
04:16:57.170 --> 04:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
building a one-bedroom house I don't see
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
why that's not allowed yeah I hate to
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
see it once you get the excavator in
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
there all your materials and supplies
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's probably not going to be that much
 
04:17:06.650 --> 04:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
of a difference that's exactly right if
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
you do allow them to build a one bedroom
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
septic system you're pretty much locking
 
04:17:12.769 --> 04:17:12.779 align:start position:0%
the house in from ever being able to put
 
04:17:15.469 --> 04:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
an addition on it etc etc I mean when
 
04:17:16.729 --> 04:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
you look at the cost difference between
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
one and four in a septic system with
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
everything that's involved I bet you
 
04:17:21.530 --> 04:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's insignificant but that's just my
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
well you're exactly right I haven't had
 
04:17:26.929 --> 04:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
testimony to that fact it's possible 200
 
04:17:30.769 --> 04:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.779 --> 04:17:31.969 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:17:31.969 --> 04:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:17:38.809 --> 04:17:38.819 align:start position:0%
what is it oh Josh
 
04:17:41.809 --> 04:17:41.819 align:start position:0%
um so I was looking at so other than
 
04:17:45.849 --> 04:17:45.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:48.530 --> 04:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
processes so what you're saying uh
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
representative Joe Kelly is you'd like
 
04:17:54.290 --> 04:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
to see Des take a data set driven fax of
 
04:17:56.929 --> 04:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
the matter case-by-case basis to septic
 
04:18:00.410 --> 04:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
loading on a particular site as a
 
04:18:01.990 --> 04:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
function of
 
04:18:05.330 --> 04:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
percolation rate of the particular soils
 
04:18:07.010 --> 04:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
and not just some cookie cutter
 
04:18:07.020 --> 04:18:08.290 align:start position:0%
and not just some cookie cutter
Arboretum

04:18:08.290 --> 04:18:08.300 align:start position:0%
Arboretum
 
04:18:11.630 --> 04:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh 150 gallons per bedroom per user
 
04:18:14.689 --> 04:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
right I think I I wouldn't necessarily
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
say per site I might say something like
 
04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
hey are you you're you're going to
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
design you know 25 gallons per bedroom
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
or does you know or less or 50 gallons
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
per bedroom or less or 100 gallons per
 
04:18:30.530 --> 04:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
bedroom or less like this is kind of
 
04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
like how you're gonna design this this
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
property and then maybe we have some
 
04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
guideline set for that and so you would
 
04:18:41.450 --> 04:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
get you would get your approval based on
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know you said a hundred gallons per
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
day per bedroom that that is what your
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
approval for you know that makes this a
 
04:18:50.880 --> 04:18:51.650 align:start position:0%
approval for you know that makes this a
three

04:18:51.650 --> 04:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:18:54.290 --> 04:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
you know bedroom apartment or a three
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
bedroom system if you change that to 150
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
maybe it's only a two bedroom system
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
right or something like that and so it
 
04:19:04.490 --> 04:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
might you know have like a grid that
 
04:19:06.650 --> 04:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
that your
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
and so it's not just one Sis one one
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
option there's you can come in and say
 
04:19:16.729 --> 04:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm building you know based on
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
all these low flow where I'm having a
 
04:19:21.170 --> 04:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
compostable toilet that you know or
 
04:19:23.929 --> 04:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
whatever and so I'm going I'm shooting
 
04:19:23.939 --> 04:19:25.010 align:start position:0%
whatever and so I'm going I'm shooting
for

04:19:25.010 --> 04:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:19:29.689 --> 04:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
two bed you know 25 gallons per you know
 
04:19:32.210 --> 04:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
and so that would be on this chart and
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
that would make my you know
 
04:19:36.650 --> 04:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
and so it would be that'll be a
 
04:19:36.660 --> 04:19:38.150 align:start position:0%
and so it would be that'll be a
non-stata

04:19:38.150 --> 04:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
non-stata
 
04:19:39.650 --> 04:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
04:19:42.110 --> 04:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
um based on
 
04:19:45.650 --> 04:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
someone someone uh
 
04:19:48.170 --> 04:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
the design person would design the
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
building to meet certain
 
04:19:52.969 --> 04:19:52.979 align:start position:0%
like thresholds right if there was
 
04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
different thresholds instead of just
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's only one threshold it's 150
 
04:20:01.610 --> 04:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
gallons per day per per uh and so I
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
think that's an inappropriate to only
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
have one threshold all right so I don't
 
04:20:07.610 --> 04:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
think that was a hot button for any of
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
the developers at this point I have a
 
04:20:12.170 --> 04:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
memo from housing action New Hampshire
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
with 10 policy
 
04:20:15.650 --> 04:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
they sent it to us before so I'm gonna
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
just start from number one streamlining
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
I think that's something that's
 
04:20:28.010 --> 04:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
something that we can yeah is coordinate
 
04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
um you know if you need Municipal
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
inspections have it all happen at one
 
04:20:33.410 --> 04:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
time allow for that
 
04:20:36.290 --> 04:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
One Stop Shop for permitting
 
04:20:38.809 --> 04:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
um number two is improve New Hampshire's
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
Adu law so we're already working on that
 
04:20:43.370 --> 04:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
number three is des report on water
 
04:20:45.530 --> 04:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
Sewer Septic so they said proposed
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
legislation could Direct Des to provide
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
legislature with a report on current
 
04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
water Sewer Septic standards advise on
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
updates to the science outline needing
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
statutory recommendations accommodate
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
increased housing needs so basically
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
what I what I heard today from Des is
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
that there's some
 
04:21:03.889 --> 04:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
there's some rules that have been there
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
since like 1973 and like
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
we asked about updated technology and
 
04:21:10.490 --> 04:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
how it's affecting the rulemaking
 
04:21:12.650 --> 04:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
process and I I don't see the connection
 
04:21:14.450 --> 04:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
between that so I want to see more of
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
that so maybe some legislation that
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
would require that
 
04:21:22.250 --> 04:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
um like they use they inform us of you
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
know new tech inform the
 
04:21:26.590 --> 04:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
um environment and AD committee every
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
every biennium on
 
04:21:31.490 --> 04:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
um new technologies or something about
 
04:21:31.500 --> 04:21:32.269 align:start position:0%
um new technologies or something about
that

04:21:32.269 --> 04:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
the general court just to kind of update
 
04:21:36.170 --> 04:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
us on that so that they're looking at it
 
04:21:38.330 --> 04:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
and then we're also informed on it I
 
04:21:39.650 --> 04:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
don't know how everyone feels represent
 
04:21:41.929 --> 04:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
Damon I would agree with that and I
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
would say maybe we or our researcher do
 
04:21:47.809 --> 04:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
some background work on the standards in
 
04:21:50.510 --> 04:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
other states I mean sure there's
 
04:21:52.210 --> 04:21:52.220 align:start position:0%
different Terrain in different places
 
04:21:54.769 --> 04:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
and I can't believe I'm going to say
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
this out loud but you know Hampshire is
 
04:21:58.130 --> 04:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
not completely unique I mean
 
04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
we could we could find out what's up to
 
04:22:03.290 --> 04:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
date elsewhere yeah the I mean the 150
 
04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
gallons per bedroom kind of thing was a
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
little like like why this number and
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
they said it was conservative and I'm
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
like what's conservative to use
 
04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
no representative Damon maybe is a
 
04:22:15.170 --> 04:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
little different than conservative to
 
04:22:18.170 --> 04:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
you well and I think he seemed to not be
 
04:22:20.090 --> 04:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
open to
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing the advances in for instance
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
a washing machine that uses 25 of the
 
04:22:28.250 --> 04:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
water that used to be common in a
 
04:22:30.110 --> 04:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
washing machine and those are standard
 
04:22:33.290 --> 04:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
washers now yeah and and the argument is
 
04:22:34.910 --> 04:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
is you could replace it with something
 
04:22:36.889 --> 04:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
else that isn't as efficiency but yes
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
all of these are being built high
 
04:22:40.969 --> 04:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
efficiency now it was the 150 gallons
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
per bedroom because I missed part of
 
04:22:44.689 --> 04:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
that this morning what what period of
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
time is that
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
per day
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's huge that's a lot I don't think I
 
04:22:53.210 --> 04:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
although you could probably use 50
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
gallons in a shower without too much
 
04:22:57.250 --> 04:22:57.260 align:start position:0%
trouble but
 
04:23:00.110 --> 04:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes per bedroom per day is this is what
 
04:23:04.610 --> 04:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
they've been using
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
so that I so number three definitely Des
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
report something Kristen around
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
um requiring Des to provide the general
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
court with
 
04:23:16.729 --> 04:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
um new technologies you know we could
 
04:23:18.410 --> 04:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
direct it to the environmental AG
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee or what some committee or the
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
Senate General Court whatever
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
um number four is commercially zoned
 
04:23:26.330 --> 04:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
opportunities proposed legislation could
 
04:23:28.130 --> 04:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
incentivize infill residential housing
 
04:23:35.889 --> 04:23:35.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:37.969 --> 04:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
yeah I like that
 
04:23:40.010 --> 04:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
um like the mixed I guess it's like
 
04:23:42.530 --> 04:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
mixed use where you're doing business on
 
04:23:46.010 --> 04:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
the lower lower floors and and like
 
04:23:49.130 --> 04:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
apartments above it kind of a thing
 
04:23:49.140 --> 04:23:50.150 align:start position:0%
apartments above it kind of a thing
um

04:23:50.150 --> 04:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:51.889 --> 04:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
what we can look at is there anything on
 
04:23:53.330 --> 04:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
the state level that's stopping towns
 
04:23:54.650 --> 04:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
from doing that already and I don't
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
think there is already it's already I
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
mean some places allow it
 
04:24:02.809 --> 04:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not I'm not as limited
 
04:24:05.809 --> 04:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
um I think that there's I think that
 
04:24:05.819 --> 04:24:06.429 align:start position:0%
um I think that there's I think that
um

04:24:06.429 --> 04:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
there I would also like to consider
 
04:24:10.680 --> 04:24:13.210 align:start position:0%
there I would also like to consider
um

04:24:13.210 --> 04:24:13.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
incentivizing municipalities to move
 
04:24:18.290 --> 04:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
away from
 
04:24:20.269 --> 04:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
um just
 
04:24:20.279 --> 04:24:21.950 align:start position:0%
um just
um

04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:24.830 --> 04:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
lot acre requirements that are not tied
 
04:24:28.250 --> 04:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
to soils soil type for
 
04:24:28.260 --> 04:24:29.090 align:start position:0%
to soils soil type for
um

04:24:29.090 --> 04:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:32.450 --> 04:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
for properties that have
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
um refused to mandate anything from the
 
04:24:40.849 --> 04:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
state level that tells the municipality
 
04:24:42.889 --> 04:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
what to do with their lot sizes period
 
04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
end of story we'll we can argue until
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
we're that's fine I'm happy to propose
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
It Anyways that's yeah you might not get
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
but I think I think that that is
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
important okay so number five I have
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
infield development proposed legislation
 
04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
could create reasonable opportunities
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
for infill development in urban Suburban
 
04:25:05.450 --> 04:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
villages Town centers in zones that
 
04:25:07.130 --> 04:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
otherwise don't allow multi-family
 
04:25:09.050 --> 04:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
residential development again I think
 
04:25:11.150 --> 04:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's a top-down thing I kind of don't
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
want to look at and correlated sorry
 
04:25:15.050 --> 04:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
04:25:17.410 --> 04:25:17.420 align:start position:0%
I think correlated with that
 
04:25:20.110 --> 04:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
use of
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
malls old schools I mean properties that
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
could become housing I don't know how we
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
would look at that but I think it's
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
something that might incorporate into
 
04:25:31.150 --> 04:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
that yeah repurposing existing
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
structures repurposing existing okay
 
04:25:37.130 --> 04:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
um fourplexing growth areas so we had
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
this fourplex bill I don't think we want
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
to touch that as a committee
 
04:25:42.050 --> 04:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
um number seven owners parking
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
requirements proposed legislation could
 
04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
establish a reasonable parking
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
requirements eliminate onerous
 
04:25:48.649 --> 04:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
requirements that often result in empty
 
04:25:50.809 --> 04:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
paved Lots impose costly barriers to
 
04:25:52.370 --> 04:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
Housing Development
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much yeah what appetite
 
04:25:57.110 --> 04:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
there is for that I agree that there
 
04:25:58.969 --> 04:25:58.979 align:start position:0%
could be an issue with some cases
 
04:26:01.490 --> 04:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
but as like I said on the planning board
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
for 13 years
 
04:26:07.130 --> 04:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
we we went too far with minimal parking
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
requirements and it was a nightmare and
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
and it was actually the developers and
 
04:26:13.610 --> 04:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
the tenants that asked us to increase
 
04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
them because
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
it might sound like a good idea and
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
might sound affordable to reduce the
 
04:26:20.570 --> 04:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
parking spaces as much as you can until
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
you need them so I'm not opposed to the
 
04:26:24.410 --> 04:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
idea but how we come up with that
 
04:26:25.849 --> 04:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
formula could be the challenging part
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
the form right yeah
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
the only the only thing I see is is
 
04:26:34.370 --> 04:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable is the Adu if you
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
have one bedroom only being up like if
 
04:26:38.450 --> 04:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
you have a one bedroom Adu I don't see
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
you having you can require more than one
 
04:26:40.920 --> 04:26:42.170 align:start position:0%
you having you can require more than one
off

04:26:42.170 --> 04:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
off
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
um off street parking
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know where the appetite is on
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
that I don't I don't think that's two
 
04:26:47.040 --> 04:26:49.370 align:start position:0%
that I don't I don't think that's two
onerous

04:26:49.370 --> 04:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
onerous
 
04:26:51.530 --> 04:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
right exactly
 
04:26:53.450 --> 04:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
um number eight onerous lot size and
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
arbitrary house home sizes minimum
 
04:26:58.010 --> 04:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation could limit onerous
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
lot sizes for Housing Development and
 
04:27:01.130 --> 04:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
open up opportunities for smaller
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
starter homes
 
04:27:05.570 --> 04:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know what we think about that
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
I do I do um we heard earlier today that
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
there was a you know a requirement of a
 
04:27:15.889 --> 04:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
certain square footage for these
 
04:27:18.170 --> 04:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
apartments I think that there should not
 
04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
be any now that I think that we should
 
04:27:24.410 --> 04:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
have eliminated minimum square footage
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
requirements when we instituted the tiny
 
04:27:31.729 --> 04:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
Home Building requirements or the
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
building code because the building code
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
now for those tiny homes now treats how
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
to do those those smaller square foot
 
04:27:45.469 --> 04:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
properties safely and so I don't I think
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
that requiring
 
04:27:48.239 --> 04:27:50.750 align:start position:0%
that requiring
anything

04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:27:52.969 --> 04:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
um you know less than Square 400 square
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
feet or whatever their there's already a
 
04:27:57.290 --> 04:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
code for that and how to do it safely
 
04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
and so I think that
 
04:27:59.220 --> 04:28:00.410 align:start position:0%
and so I think that
um

04:28:00.410 --> 04:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:00.420 --> 04:28:01.969 align:start position:0%
um
any

04:28:01.969 --> 04:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:28:04.849 --> 04:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
um size requirements are now essentially
 
04:28:06.889 --> 04:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
should have been removed already when
 
04:28:08.450 --> 04:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
when we uh
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
when we put that building code in
 
04:28:13.849 --> 04:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
no lot not lot size you're talking about
 
04:28:15.889 --> 04:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
square footage requirements like I have
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
to build a 500 or a 10 000 square foot
 
04:28:20.750 --> 04:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
house right my house is smaller than the
 
04:28:23.090 --> 04:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
how the requirement that they were
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
saying for apartments they were saying
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
what 800 square feet for apartments
 
04:28:29.210 --> 04:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
800 square feet for an apartment my
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
whole house is smaller than that right
 
04:28:35.830 --> 04:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
and there and so I think right exactly
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
and so so I think all of those are
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear much of it I I recall the
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
conversation on the apartments today I'm
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
gonna have to look I'm not even sure if
 
04:28:52.010 --> 04:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
my town has a square footage requirement
 
04:28:54.649 --> 04:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
for the actual building size how many
 
04:28:58.189 --> 04:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
towns do we know have that for single
 
04:28:58.199 --> 04:28:59.229 align:start position:0%
towns do we know have that for single
families

04:28:59.229 --> 04:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:29:02.689 --> 04:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
in many towns and then the code when
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
Bill McKinney came in and talked about
 
04:29:04.260 --> 04:29:05.630 align:start position:0%
Bill McKinney came in and talked about
code

04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:29:06.889 --> 04:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
um he said that you could build an
 
04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
apartment 170 square feet and it would
 
04:29:10.729 --> 04:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
be up to code so
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
I I think this is one of these
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
situations where this is a the only
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
thing that's in places to deter and not
 
04:29:19.130 --> 04:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
do I mean right it's not a safety
 
04:29:20.929 --> 04:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
concern so we have to find like if
 
04:29:22.250 --> 04:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
there's actually a reason for it
 
04:29:25.309 --> 04:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
restricting like having a minimum
 
04:29:28.990 --> 04:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:32.210 --> 04:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
just just later this whole process that
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
we're going through a little bit more
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
once we determine the list of things we
 
04:29:37.969 --> 04:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
think need to be tackled we might then
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
want to look at subcommittees to tackle
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
some of these things to actually dig
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
into the weeds yeah so I mean it's gonna
 
04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
be a lot of fun it's going to be a great
 
04:29:46.969 --> 04:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
summer it's going to be awesome and and
 
04:29:46.979 --> 04:29:48.649 align:start position:0%
summer it's going to be awesome and and
fortunately

04:29:48.649 --> 04:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
fortunately
 
04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
um we are breaking from July to August
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
15th but we'll have time so I'm gonna
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
have Kristen help put all this together
 
04:29:56.450 --> 04:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
for us and then we'll establish
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittees from there but the last
 
04:29:58.319 --> 04:30:01.030 align:start position:0%
subcommittees from there but the last
one

04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:03.710 --> 04:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
yes like the housing committee is
 
04:30:03.720 --> 04:30:05.750 align:start position:0%
yes like the housing committee is
breaking

04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
breaking
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
everybody has to yeah for six weeks
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
so the last one I have is enable
 
04:30:13.849 --> 04:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
pre-permanenting permitting so um James
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
brought this up a little bit but most
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
legislation could enable municipalities
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
to pre-approve sites for multi-family
 
04:30:20.809 --> 04:30:20.819 align:start position:0%
Housing Development that meets certain
 
04:30:23.090 --> 04:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
fire safety design and health standards
 
04:30:23.100 --> 04:30:24.349 align:start position:0%
fire safety design and health standards
so

04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:27.290 --> 04:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
um maybe if there's like a
 
04:30:30.170 --> 04:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
blueprint like a pre-approved blueprint
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
or something template I love that idea
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
of pre-approved designs that
 
04:30:38.030 --> 04:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
save people an enormous amount of
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
process and expense
 
04:30:43.370 --> 04:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
you know I unfortunately didn't hear all
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
those presentation this time but I heard
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
it previously
 
04:30:46.800 --> 04:30:47.389 align:start position:0%
it previously
um

04:30:47.389 --> 04:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know the idea of there being half a
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
dozen different designs people could
 
04:30:53.689 --> 04:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
pick from that maybe the state creates
 
04:30:56.450 --> 04:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
I think that would be awesome go ahead
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
and that on that I agree because I heard
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
the statement before I can get online
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
right now and look at tens of thousands
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
of architect designed house plants and
 
04:31:08.450 --> 04:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
floor plans and I'm sure there's
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
somebody doing it for adu's now too I
 
04:31:11.929 --> 04:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
just don't know where the government
 
04:31:13.729 --> 04:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
needs to continue to get in to offer
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
things like that it's a unless they went
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
in and said these are the designs that
 
04:31:21.290 --> 04:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
would be approved and you wouldn't need
 
04:31:23.210 --> 04:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
an inspection for well everything's
 
04:31:24.410 --> 04:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
going to be everything's going to need
 
04:31:27.050 --> 04:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
to be inspected for quality and and for
 
04:31:28.849 --> 04:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
completion you're not gonna you're not
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
going to get away from that yeah
 
04:31:32.450 --> 04:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
well you're talk you're talking about
 
04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
inspections once it's built that's we're
 
04:31:36.649 --> 04:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about like the approval
 
04:31:38.590 --> 04:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
process that
 
04:31:42.110 --> 04:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
getting to the actual like building of
 
04:31:44.450 --> 04:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
the thing so the design is happening
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
before you're not designing it after you
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
built it right you're building you have
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
the design before building and so I do
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
like that I I'm concerned with this you
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
know we can't meet for six weeks or
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
whatever are we going to be able to meet
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
as a committee before that starts to
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
give us like the list of all the things
 
04:32:03.720 --> 04:32:05.750 align:start position:0%
give us like the list of all the things
and

04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:07.610 --> 04:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
um that we need to be working on and
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
maybe give each of you know assign those
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
P you know address you know create a
 
04:32:15.950 --> 04:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
draft for this topic and have it ready
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the end of the six weeks when we'll
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
start up again with D um you know uh OLS
 
04:32:24.110 --> 04:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
and we're going to all amend it to you
 
04:32:24.120 --> 04:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
and we're going to all amend it to you
know

04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna say say you're mending
 
04:32:31.330 --> 04:32:31.340 align:start position:0%
you know HB 111 or whatever and
 
04:32:33.889 --> 04:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
we'll just have all your amendments for
 
04:32:36.830 --> 04:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
HB 111 on when we come back for the six
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
weeks or whatever can we have that all
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
nailed down before the six weeks or
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.490 --> 04:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
I mean it
 
04:33:00.410 --> 04:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
I yeah you could like you could throw it
 
04:33:02.330 --> 04:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
on anything we don't I just wanna I
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
think right right I don't think it I
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
think the mechanism is just any bill
 
04:33:09.410 --> 04:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been disposed of we can
 
04:33:12.051 --> 04:33:12.061 align:start position:0%
technically draft an amendment too it
 
04:33:13.369 --> 04:33:13.379 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be submitted to the
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
floor or whatever you know it would just
 
04:33:18.650 --> 04:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment and and use that to
 
04:33:20.810 --> 04:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
work in the committee session and so
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
then we would have like you know and
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
then it could even be posted online that
 
04:33:26.400 --> 04:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
then it could even be posted online that
people

04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:33:29.810 --> 04:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
um you know we could have this committee
 
04:33:32.209 --> 04:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
have you know Amendment you know we're
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing amendments you know
 
04:33:36.769 --> 04:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah so that we could have you
 
04:33:39.650 --> 04:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
know people come in say like Hey we're
 
04:33:41.810 --> 04:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know uh we're concerned about this
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
amendment it's drafted this way and you
 
04:33:45.051 --> 04:33:45.061 align:start position:0%
know you get the public notice and you
 
04:33:46.730 --> 04:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
get the you know some feedback even
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
possible ideally for when the bill is
 
04:33:52.730 --> 04:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
introduced I mean that's great but if uh
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
part of work sessions is that some
 
04:33:55.439 --> 04:33:56.510 align:start position:0%
part of work sessions is that some
people

04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
know know what we're talking about and
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
come and give feedback and say that's
 
04:34:02.689 --> 04:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
not a great idea because as much um
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
expertise as we have on the committee
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's you know other people that we
 
04:34:08.631 --> 04:34:08.641 align:start position:0%
have come and speak to us for a reason
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
that they can shed some light on I don't
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
know if I can miss the chair I think
 
04:34:16.609 --> 04:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
Simplicity wise we've been charged with
 
04:34:18.769 --> 04:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
the task of trying to find Solutions we
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
weren't given any bills I think we
 
04:34:22.609 --> 04:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
continue our task of trying to find the
 
04:34:24.410 --> 04:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
solutions and working on getting some
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
draft legislation for next year I don't
 
04:34:28.730 --> 04:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
think I don't see the need to start
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
trying to attach non-germaine amendments
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
etc etc because at the end of the day
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to act on
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
those until January anyway when the same
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
time we'll be up if this committee still
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
exists or our bills go to Municipal
 
04:34:43.609 --> 04:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
either that they'll be dealing with them
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
in January as well we're not saving a
 
04:34:48.170 --> 04:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
whole lot of time and if it's any help I
 
04:34:49.849 --> 04:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
don't know if you saw the big news on TV
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
today that the rent prices are finally
 
04:34:57.529 --> 04:34:57.539 align:start position:0%
relieving it's a national Trend the free
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
Market's actually starting to work when
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
demand goes down so do the prices so did
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
we just solve it not doing anything I I
 
04:35:07.449 --> 04:35:07.459 align:start position:0%
don't think we should
 
04:35:10.131 --> 04:35:10.141 align:start position:0%
I I was never suggesting attaching
 
04:35:10.141 --> 04:35:13.670 align:start position:0%
I I was never suggesting attaching
anything

04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
yes we need amendments to be able to
 
04:35:18.769 --> 04:35:18.779 align:start position:0%
have actual language to critique in this
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee like otherwise we're doing
 
04:35:23.449 --> 04:35:23.459 align:start position:0%
just random like I wrote this down on a
 
04:35:25.250 --> 04:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and now we're going to
 
04:35:27.170 --> 04:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
critique it I'm saying that
 
04:35:30.410 --> 04:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
how the mechanism for drafting anything
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
through Los you OLS you actually have to
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
have something to attach it to because
 
04:35:39.709 --> 04:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
there's you cannot request a bill to be
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
drafted a new bill to be drafted until
 
04:35:44.269 --> 04:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
Bill filing season and so how do you
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
actually have OLS actually attach or
 
04:35:50.929 --> 04:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
draft you anything you have to have a
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
mechanism and I'm suggesting the
 
04:35:55.730 --> 04:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
mechanism could be an amendment we don't
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
actually put in the amendment we don't
 
04:36:00.769 --> 04:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
actually we just have it drafted so that
 
04:36:02.449 --> 04:36:02.459 align:start position:0%
we can work on it and have something
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
here in the committee to work on and
 
04:36:07.369 --> 04:36:07.379 align:start position:0%
then we actually take that drafted
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment and actually file it next year
 
04:36:12.170 --> 04:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
as a new bill I'm not actually saying
 
04:36:14.929 --> 04:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
that we do non-germain amendments okay I
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying we would
 
04:36:20.209 --> 04:36:20.219 align:start position:0%
just use it as a vehicle I do too but
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
again I think we're four steps ahead of
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
it first we need to know what we even
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
want to say so so action items I'm gonna
 
04:36:26.810 --> 04:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
have Kristen just throw together a small
 
04:36:29.449 --> 04:36:29.459 align:start position:0%
memo for us to see like issue areas I'm
 
04:36:30.890 --> 04:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
going to send it to the committee have
 
04:36:32.449 --> 04:36:32.459 align:start position:0%
everybody sign up to volunteer on
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and I want to have a work
 
04:36:37.789 --> 04:36:37.799 align:start position:0%
session before we break for July July to
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
August 15th I want to have a work
 
04:36:40.131 --> 04:36:40.141 align:start position:0%
session where we can coordinate
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
committees and have everybody work on
 
04:36:43.609 --> 04:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
those and then we can come together in
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
like September like late August early
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
September and kind of hash out what we
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
got yeah and if we can once we get that
 
04:36:53.209 --> 04:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
initial outline I think it gives
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
everybody an opportunity to look at it
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
go through their notes and maybe do a
 
04:36:59.330 --> 04:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
draft b or a second draft on you and
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
I'll send out an email and ask who is
 
04:37:03.410 --> 04:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
interested on serving a committee to
 
04:37:04.849 --> 04:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:37:08.631 --> 04:37:08.641 align:start position:0%
um requiring Des to you know publish or
 
04:37:10.970 --> 04:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
present to the general court every two
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
years or something
 
04:37:14.929 --> 04:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
okay so two quick things and I apologize
 
04:37:17.090 --> 04:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
if I missed this was there a discussion
 
04:37:20.570 --> 04:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
about evaluating impact fees further and
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
also was there any conversation about
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the lag time in the state
 
04:37:26.990 --> 04:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
adopting more up-to-date building code
 
04:37:29.209 --> 04:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
so that's what we are so those are good
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions Kristen threw together a memo
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
regarding impact fees I think it's
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
something that we should look at
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
um there was a recommendation that there
 
04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think the city of Dover made a
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we do like targeted
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
impact fees to certain things so like if
 
04:37:45.170 --> 04:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
you are to charge an impact fee it could
 
04:37:47.090 --> 04:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
go because each municipality kind of
 
04:37:48.590 --> 04:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
chooses where it goes but maybe we could
 
04:37:50.570 --> 04:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
be like if you are to charge an impact
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
fee it can go towards
 
04:37:54.349 --> 04:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
um Economic Development or I don't know
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
something but or maybe something but
 
04:37:58.609 --> 04:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
it's on the list yeah so um could you
 
04:38:00.109 --> 04:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
put impact fees on there as well please
 
04:38:02.330 --> 04:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:02.340 --> 04:38:03.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

04:38:03.410 --> 04:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:38:08.631 --> 04:38:08.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
just real quick while you're talking
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
about pressing issues I used to work for
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
the regional Planning Commission a lot
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
of what we did is work around
 
04:38:16.609 --> 04:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
Transportation issues
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that uh came to my
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
Discovery over time was that a lot of
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities adopt their subdivision
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
regulations directly from guidance from
 
04:38:31.369 --> 04:38:31.379 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire D.O.T and uh that Baseline
 
04:38:33.890 --> 04:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
recommendation is a 50-foot right-of-way
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
with 24 feet of asphalt X inches thick
 
04:38:39.890 --> 04:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of Overkill if you're
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
trying to build a little neighborhood
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
street to require 50 feet right away and
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
it it significantly drives up the cost
 
04:38:48.289 --> 04:38:48.299 align:start position:0%
of subdividing land and so that might be
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
one of the places where you look at uh
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
maybe hiring a consultant or working
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
with a consultant to come up with
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations for lower impact lower
 
04:39:00.529 --> 04:39:00.539 align:start position:0%
cost alternatives to standard roadway
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh I have to ask you
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:39:10.131 --> 04:39:10.141 align:start position:0%
don't the planning commissions want
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
complete streets which are sidewalks
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
both sides bump outs crosswalks a center
 
04:39:18.109 --> 04:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
median strip and an Esplanade
 
04:39:19.609 --> 04:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
and now you're going to tell me that the
 
04:39:21.490 --> 04:39:21.500 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission is is is is
 
04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
recommending substandard roads
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
well let's let's uh imagine for a second
 
04:39:29.689 --> 04:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
there's a piece of land that could hold
 
04:39:33.170 --> 04:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
Eight houses on it and it is only
 
04:39:35.090 --> 04:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
requires a hundred feet of right-of-way
 
04:39:38.630 --> 04:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
and it's not uh substantial arterial
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
Road it's a tertiary Road right like
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be wonderful if that could
 
04:39:46.250 --> 04:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
be something as simple as a compacted
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
gravel or uh stone dust road that is a
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
shared Lane between pedestrians and cars
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
people drive slow and it looks like a
 
04:39:56.630 --> 04:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
camp right like how many of you have
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
gone to a Lakeside Camp down a little
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
single Path Road where you have to pull
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
off the road to let another car go by
 
04:40:03.788 --> 04:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
like sunshine and rainbows
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well it's usually the people that
 
04:40:07.368 --> 04:40:07.378 align:start position:0%
own those camps that maintain the road
 
04:40:08.690 --> 04:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
because the town doesn't want to have
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the dirt one but uh
 
04:40:13.010 --> 04:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
no it's it's a neat thought
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all right is there anything
 
04:40:17.690 --> 04:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
else for the committee
 
04:40:19.970 --> 04:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that but we are
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.878 --> 04:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
