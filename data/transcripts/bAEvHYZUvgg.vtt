representative Stringham
 
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman thank you for the
 
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
invitation I am Jerry Stringham I
 
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
represent uh Lincoln and Woodstock I
 
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
served on the Ways and Means Committee
 
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
from 2018 to 2020. so I had some
 
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
background in our sin taxes I my
 
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
background includes degrees from MIT in
 
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
the Harvard Business School after uh
 
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
several years as a medical device
 
00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur I spent the last 25 years
 
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
as a strategy consultant to medical
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
technology companies
 
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm also joined on this bill by
 
00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Schamberg who's uh
 
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
who's over here as well he's my
 
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
compatriot in out of the box thinking
 
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
and if it's helpful you can think of
 
00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
this bill as a Tom and Jerry Bill if you
 
00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start position:0%
this bill as a Tom and Jerry Bill if you
like

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't propose new
 
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
regulation so it was certainly geared
 
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
that way but I'm happy to bring it here
 
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
but hope it reaches Ways and Means as
 
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
well the bill is divided into three
 
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
sections the first discusses and and
 
00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 align:start position:0%
proposes to change the process
 
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
for the cigarette tax secondly something
 
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
similar for The Vaping and e-cigarette
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
tax and then finally addresses a
 
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
committee to discuss the tobacco
 
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
settlement funds all of these were part
 
00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
of discussions uh from several years ago
 
00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 align:start position:0%
uh let's start with the cigarette tax
 
00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.589 align:start position:0%
uh let's start with the cigarette tax
um

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
a few observations a cigarette tax rate
 
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
is set by the legislature currently it's
 
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
a dollar seventy eight uh cross-border
 
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
sales is a significant factor over 50
 
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
percent of our sales comes from uh
 
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.350 align:start position:0%
percent of our sales comes from uh
residents

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
generally from New England but outside
 
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh the demand uh the the marketplace the
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
demand is very elastic uh based on
 
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
pricing and tax rates so paying
 
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
attention to that has significant
 
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
impacts on on what kind of revenues we
 
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.770 align:start position:0%
impacts on on what kind of revenues we
generate

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
generate
 
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh so lower prices and lower taxes
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
generally generate more sales
 
00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
our rates are the lowest uh in the
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
region which is primarily us and our
 
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
three contiguous states is kind of a One
 
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.190 align:start position:0%
three contiguous states is kind of a One
Marketplace

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
 
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 align:start position:0%
um in the 2018 to 2020 uh ways and means
 
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
we are testimony from groups like The
 
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association and ACS
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
American Cancer Society that keys to
 
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
limiting cancer and heart deaths was a
 
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
combination of three factors regulation
 
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
Taxation and cessation
 
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
uh tax uh tax changes should be
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
considered uh uh at the time
 
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
um you know we looked at you know our
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
closest competitor and price or tax rate
 
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
which was Maine which was slightly
 
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
higher than us about 11 and still the
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
case I spoke to two main reps at the
 
00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
case I spoke to two main reps at the
time

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
um uh one was pushing for lower taxes so
 
00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 align:start position:0%
that they can compete with us in their
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
border area and the other uh seeking to
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
raise funds and had a bill that way
 
00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
um you know part part of their
 
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
reluctance to raise taxes in in Maine is
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh the impact that it would have on
 
00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 align:start position:0%
losing sales to us
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh an epiphany occurred to me while
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
reading New York Times article last
 
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
November about how we handled online
 
00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
gambling in the state and
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and how how uh you know essentially
 
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
our take was established and I'll I'll
 
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
read a quote today 31 States permit
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
Sports gambling online the gambling
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
industry press states to set tax rate
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
low in sports betting warning that it if
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
the states pushed rates too high sports
 
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
fans would turn to the black market to
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
place bets on unregulated sites These
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
Warnings turned out to be misplaced this
 
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
is again still quoting some States
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
including New York and New Hampshire
 
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
ignored the industry's advice and
 
00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 align:start position:0%
installed the highest rates on betting
 
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
they have seen bets placed at a higher
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
rate per capita than low rate states in
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
fact New York has seen such a high rate
 
00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
of betting that has collected 546
 
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the first 10 months
 
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
of 2022 which is 50 of the entire online
 
00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 align:start position:0%
Sports gambling take for states in the
 
00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
Sports gambling take for states in the
country

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.490 align:start position:0%
country
uh

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 align:start position:0%
New York Times didn't get in entirely
 
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
right because we didn't really set a tax
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
rate for online Sports gambling what we
 
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
did was we allowed our Administration
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
to go out and get the best deal rather
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
than us micromanaging the rate of
 
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.689 align:start position:0%
than us micromanaging the rate of
Taxation

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 align:start position:0%
Taxation
 
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
we used our our terrific Lottery
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
Commission and Charlie McIntyre uh to go
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
out and work a deal and on a voluntary
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
basis the amount that we that we take
 
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 align:start position:0%
from our on online gambling uh partner
 
00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
is turns out to be right about where New
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
York is and way above where the
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
legislature set in the rest of the
 
00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.950 align:start position:0%
legislature set in the rest of the
country

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.390 align:start position:0%
country
so

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you know so there's precedence for uh
 
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.310 align:start position:0%
um you know so there's precedence for uh
us

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
maintaining control over this process by
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh by engaging with with with the
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
administration but allowing their
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
full-time expertise to make decisions
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
sometimes day by day I mean if you think
 
00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 align:start position:0%
about it even something like hard liquor
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
how much how much tax is there in a
 
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
bottle of Jack Daniels that changes
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
based on market conditions and uh and
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
it's set by The Liquor Commission not by
 
00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
us as a legislature but the take we to
 
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
take we get
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
um you know is in some ways you could
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
think of as a tax
 
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.950 align:start position:0%
think of as a tax
so

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think I think the the success in the
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
online gambling and it was it was
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
certainly uh a heavy process uh and and
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
where we come out in this article is a
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
surprise even even the ways and means
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
members uh that uh uh that we did such a
 
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
better job and I know Charlie is uh
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre is presented to Vermont
 
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.090 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre is presented to Vermont
who's

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
um uh proposing online uh gambling
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
so for cigarette tax uh it's another
 
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
form of of a syntax and I certainly you
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
know if we get the same amount of money
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
I'd rather get money from from a tobacco
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
than say business profits or some
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
something that we're
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't have an externality
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
associated with it but what it does is
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
it guarantees uh that we're the low low
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
tax uh uh state in the region so if
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in Maine is thinking they're
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
going to undercut us they won't and
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
they'll they won't try but it allows the
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
tax rate to change uh based on local
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
market conditions without new
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
legislation or legislative approval we
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
can still still manage the process
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
through through annual uh oversight
 
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh so that's uh that's kind of a
 
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
background on the on the cigarette tax
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
the second address is uh E-cigarettes
 
00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:18.419 align:start position:0%
are vaping
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
um keeping in mind again the three
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
criteria of of uh regulation cessation
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
and Taxation uh the bill we passed a
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
legal regulating vaping also occurred in
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
2018 to 2020. the primary goal was to
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
regulate what was a Health crisis uh and
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
it was quite rampant among our young at
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
um the tax rate
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
um is a bit complicated as as the fiscal
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
note would say depending on what type of
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
product it is but it was largely put in
 
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
as a placeholder
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and in some cases it's
 
00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
um it needs to re-examination for
 
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
example the eight eight percent uh of
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
wholesale cost that's less than uh what
 
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
we uh what we tax a tuna fish sandwich
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
for uh right now in New Hampshire
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a relatively uh smaller
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
piece it's less than one two hundredth
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
of what we collect in cigarette taxes at
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
the time but I think it's time to
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
reassess this tax and and perhaps uh uh
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes a similar structure
 
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
of of allowing Administration to work
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
within confines
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
of finally the third section deals with
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
a committee to understand the use of
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
tobacco funds this was originally a bill
 
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
that was uh supported and forwarded by
 
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:47.180 align:start position:0%
Edith Tucker in ways and means
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
in particular the tobacco settlement
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
funds uses
 
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.790 align:start position:0%
funds uses
um

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
our uses
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
compared to its legislative mandate
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to study you know
 
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:03.860 align:start position:0%
working for a tobacco company is an easy
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
however in some of the states the use of
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement funds is quite a bit
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
more creative for example in North
 
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.930 align:start position:0%
more creative for example in North
Carolina

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
Carolina
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh they have a program called Golden
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
Leaf the Golden Leaf fund is supplied
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
over 55 million dollars in in-state high
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
quality education grants
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
um this information provided by this
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
report I think would see as a foundation
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing compared to what the
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
Mandate or Direction was at the time and
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
whether they're suitable other
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
opportunities for these funds so to
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
summarize part one and two propose a
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
methodological change so it still makes
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
this a a low tax state it provides a
 
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.870 align:start position:0%
this a a low tax state it provides a
mechanism

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't leave too much money on the
 
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:52.579 align:start position:0%
table since since
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
syntaxes are generally uh somewhat more
 
00:10:58.930 --> 00:10:58.940 align:start position:0%
desirable it's basically a market forced
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
fee set on a regular basis by the
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
experts that we've hired to run our
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
government rather than the legislature
 
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.150 align:start position:0%
government rather than the legislature
itself

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
I also think that this market-driven
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
process should be considered for other
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
potential syntaxes that may come up like
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take any questions any
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
I received some letters from some big
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
some small vaping stores they seem to
 
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
think that raising the tax that eight
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
percent is going to hurt them
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
can you comment on that because they
 
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
seem to think that that's going to bring
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
it to the point where they won't be able
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
to stay in business it's not low enough
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
they say
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm not making judgment one way or
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
the other that they you know they feel
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's not low enough that anybody would
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
come across the state to come to and
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
they say 50 of their sales is from out
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think the the e-cigarette
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and vaping tax situation is more
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
complicated than cigarettes because of
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
the way that they're they're done and um
 
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
and I think the mechanism of how uh how
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
customers decide which product to
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
purchase by state is somewhat different
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
um so uh and also the revenue piece is
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
is a lot smaller right now I do think I
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
do think those taxes were put in as
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
placeholders and I do think uh both the
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism of how it's set and what they
 
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.250 align:start position:0%
mechanism of how it's set and what they
are

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.810 align:start position:0%
are
um

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh needs needs to be updated because it
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
was definitely it was definitely thrown
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
in uh as a placeholder at the time I see
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
and the other half of the question is
 
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire thank
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
you well I'm sorry you may inquire
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
further question oh I'm sorry I'm new at
 
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.990 align:start position:0%
further question oh I'm sorry I'm new at
this

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh I noticed that cigars aren't taxed
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
as much as cigarettes I mean and they
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
cause as much problems as cigarettes
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
what what is that about uh well premium
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
cigars is addressed in another bill I
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
think going directly to Ways and Means I
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
see uh with another sponsor
 
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.889 align:start position:0%
see uh with another sponsor
um

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
you know just 10 seconds on it we do
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people buy premium cigars
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
via uh online that creates other other
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
complications and issues that would need
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
to be addressed with that specific
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
product there are small scars that
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
they're that are taxed like cigarettes
 
00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:41.629 align:start position:0%
they're that are taxed like cigarettes
though

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative petusic uh thank you Mr
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
chair uh on the charts that are on uh
 
00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:50.779 align:start position:0%
from dra
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
the uh pack of 20 tax rate from New
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Etc has anything been taken
 
00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:01.459 align:start position:0%
into account the lack of total revenue
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
because of the tax rise per pack
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
that we lose back to Massachusetts or
 
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.610 align:start position:0%
that we lose back to Massachusetts or
Maine

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
are you oh well I I think the fiscal
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
note he's looking at the old fiscal note
 
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:18.380 align:start position:0%
that came in the bill the the numbers
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
this is yeah that's in the bill it's in
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
the bill but I just had passed out to
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
everyone a new fiscal note okay so I I
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's different but that
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what it still doesn't
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
know how much we're going to lose
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
on total revenue based on your tax
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
increase per pack
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah you're saying that if um if we tax
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
it more that's going to suppress demand
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
and sales of New Hampshire cigarettes by
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
some amount this this figure here based
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
on the zero to eight percent range and
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
calculating it that way is based on on
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
no uh reduction in demand we're still
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
the low low tax state I I personally
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.069 align:start position:0%
the low low tax state I I personally
would

00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know lower those numbers a little
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
bit because
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know if if we're but if if indeed
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
the state sets the rate higher so
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee they're gonna going
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
to raise the rates um
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
um appreciably under this further
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
questioning Claire thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that you know
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a revenue drop when
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
the people go back to Massachusetts or
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
Maine and buy the cigarettes there for
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
basically the same price uh it's not
 
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.019 align:start position:0%
going to be the same price because
 
00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh charges way way more
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
than anywhere we would go at this point
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent thank you Mr
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
question so we have this chart in front
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
of us that talks about the New England
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh tobacco tax amount by state and by
 
00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.210 align:start position:0%
uh tobacco tax amount by state and by
type

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
type
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and it shows uh bordering state let's
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
just use the first one Maine they're
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
charging two dollars um per pack on
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
taxes did that take into consideration
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh the sales tax or sales tax uh I think
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's five percent of me or does that
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
apply to taxes that exempt yeah the the
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
way the bill is written it would um you
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
should use it says to use the sales tax
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
because Maine charges five and a half
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
percent sales tax so that would be 211 I
 
00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
percent sales tax so that would be 211 I
actually

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm somewhat indifferent of whether
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
you do that or not
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:29.339 align:start position:0%
um so if you didn't use it it would be
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
two dollars if you use the sales tax
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
it's 211. so it's more in in New
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's 178. thank you thank you
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Ammon
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for coming
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
and testifying
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
um question use the word micromanagement
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to zero in on that word
 
00:16:50.449 --> 00:16:50.459 align:start position:0%
um by giving the agency the ability to
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
set the tax rate
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
is there a process where the public can
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
be involved in helping to Define that
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
that rate the way it is here now when we
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a bill introduced
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
um how would that process work
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
well right now the the
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
um the rates a dollar 78 and that's it
 
00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:17.059 align:start position:0%
what what this bill proposes to allow
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
the administration to work within a
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
range without
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
um having to go to the legislature uh so
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
but they could not either go above or
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
below that range without coming back to
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
us and asking us for uh for new
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
legislation and of course at any point
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
we could uh do the same
 
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.950 align:start position:0%
we could uh do the same
so

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so make sure I understand here the
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
is that the legislature
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
sets the dollar amount
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and that and
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
you're saying well it's just dollar 78
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
well I can say here on this committee uh
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's been 30 cents a gallon for beer for
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
a very long time and over those years
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
we've had bills in to
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
raise it and we had a hearings and
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
process and
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
the bill dies so I guess what is wrong
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
with that system
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
why you know I I guess you could say is
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
does it happen every year
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh like the commissioner is supposed to
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
make a change every year uh
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
theoretically it could even in the
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
halfway through a biennium if someone
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
put in a bill to raise the severe tax
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
we could theoretically still raise the
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
beer tax yeah I mean you can't raise
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
cigarette taxes too quickly because of
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
the way that stamp distribution I mean
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
you buy these stamps and it takes a
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
while to filter out the old ones and
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
bring in new ones so practically
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
speaking there are time limitations of
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
how quickly Administration could make a
 
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.250 align:start position:0%
how quickly Administration could make a
change

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.930 align:start position:0%
change
um the

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
um I guess the the premise is I think
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
our desire is to be the low tax state
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
and to take advantage of the elastic
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
demand that comes with that but
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
um uh it's
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
um you know if if the circumstances
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
change locally and we still meet that
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
objective then we've done as a
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
legislature what we want to do
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I think it also provides a
 
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
disincentive for anybody else to try to
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
undercut us
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
so so can the commissioner just
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
unilaterally change six months into a
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
year because some other state changed
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
their rate
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
um well this talks about a once a year
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
process that's what I see where where
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
they examine uh what the what the local
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
rates are and and whether a rate is
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
warranted much like in online gambling
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh the the uh the contracted rate with
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
with our pervert preferred uh supplier
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
could change and we could be having a
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
different rate which generates revenue
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the state and then you know in that
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
case we're getting way more than we ever
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
would have gotten if we had sat around
 
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
the table and tried to come up with a
 
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:03.860 align:start position:0%
fair price that we were going to offer
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
so that that's uh but right now that
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
that Center on the table happens in ways
 
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:12.740 align:start position:0%
and means when they set the the budget
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
and and it seems have been working
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
pretty well for how many years now a
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
long time right I mean you're you're i i
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
i i I'd say it's great that you're
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
thinking out of the box and thinking
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
you're something creative but to take
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
something away from the legislature and
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
give it to a commissioner with some
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh it it seems that an ass to
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
me that that something the legislature
 
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
would want well and you know if I was in
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means which I'm going to be in
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
finance I'm in finance this term but I
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
would still feel like we had control
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
over it because we could set the range
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
and monitor the process and and pass
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
bills as necessary uh and and uh but
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
still still allow uh for market-based
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
changes uh without uh uh you know
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
frankly voting for tax increases and
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
easy either uh or so
 
00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
um but this this States really what what

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax bill
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
I don't at this point I'm just I'm not
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
quite sure I understand all of the um
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
the concept here but I wanted to at
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
least share some information with this
 
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
committee as you can see I have provided
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of Light reading for you so this
 
00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
is you know peruse
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
some of this information comes from the
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association some comes
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
from the campaign for tobacco-free kids
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
which I urge you to um you know look at
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
their website and pull up even more
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
information on Tobacco taxes and the
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
impact on health and things of that
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
nature I do have written testimony and I
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
was trying not to read what I have I do
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
want to thank the sponsor for bringing
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
this bill forward I can't remember the
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
last time we had a bill on Tobacco
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
taxation in New Hampshire I was just
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about that I don't know it has
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
been about 10 years since we have had an
 
00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:38.659 align:start position:0%
increase to at least the cigarette tax
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
several years ago there was a tax put on
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
electronic cigarettes and we do have a
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
tax rate on other tobacco products also
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
called known as otps which are generally
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
smokeless tobacco products and
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
and so the the American Heart
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
Association always supports substantial
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
tax increases in in our states
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
um and by substantial I mean a dollar a
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
pack is really our our minimum point at
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
which we encourage increasing taxation
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
um the reason is because tobacco use is
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
the leading cause of preventable disease
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
disability and death in in New Hampshire
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
as well as the rest of the country when
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
you raise the tobacco tax at a
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
substantial rate there are public health
 
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
benefits such as reducing and preventing
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco use
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
predominantly amongst youth is really
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
our Focus to help prevent that addiction
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
from starting
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
savings on health care costs from
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
tobacco-related diseases and a source of
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
funds that states can put towards their
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
tobacco prevention and cessation
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
services at the state level
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
and we have not put tobacco tax revenues
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
directly towards these efforts we have
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
not put any of our MSA dollars directly
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
towards these efforts we do have funds
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
from the state budget for prevention and
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
cessation services and another dollar
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
amount that went towards cessation for
 
00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
youth who are now using electronic
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
cigarettes at an incredible rate and we
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but it's still about 3.6
 
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
percent of what is recommended to have a
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
meaningful decrease in in tobacco use if
 
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
we could even have 15 percent of the CDC
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation which would be about 2.5
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
million that would be terrific
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
um one of the other reasons why tobacco
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
tax increases are are great for reducing
 
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
use among youth is that they are very
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
price conscious when we increase tobacco
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
cigarette taxes which we have in the
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
state we are now down to about 5.5
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
percent of high schools students use
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
traditional cigarettes but 33.8 percent
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
are now using electronic cigarettes
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
which we don't have a very meaningful
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
tax rate on and I'm not here to push a
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
tax rate change with this group just to
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
provide information on why it's
 
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:07.700 align:start position:0%
important for our Organization for
 
00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:11.179 align:start position:0%
particularly for protecting Youth
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
and these tobacco products cigarettes
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
electronics cigarettes other tobacco
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
products contain nicotine which is the
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
addictive agent within tobacco products
 
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:24.740 align:start position:0%
particularly for for youth
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
there's also the health care costs that
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in New Hampshire we have
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
about 847 million dollars annually that
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
go go towards tobacco-related illness
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
and that is a huge dollar amount and
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
only less than a million dollars going
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
towards tobacco prevention so again why
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
we would love to see an increase to a
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax in the near future
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
we will continue working towards what we
 
00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
call the tobacco and came in game to end
 
00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:58.820 align:start position:0%
all tobacco use and nicotine addiction
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to add that particularly
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
for the question that came out when
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
States raise their tobacco taxes by a
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
small amount eight percent or something
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
along those lines you will see a
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenues in your tobacco
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
tax revenues because it does not keep up
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
with the natural decrease of people
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
using tobacco products so if you do it a
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
one dollar tobacco tax increase you will
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
always see an increase in those revenues
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
even if you lose some some business for
 
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
the um the reduction that people are
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
purchasing to tobacco products at so
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to take up too much
 
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.430 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to take up too much
time

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
I am always here for you if you have any
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
questions about tobacco or any other
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
things that cause heart disease and
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
encourage you to you know reach out to
 
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
me if you ever have any questions or
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
need materials or resources
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
great would you believe I remember the
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
time where we we'd lowered the tax in
 
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
hopes that we would get more of those
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
out of state revenues that didn't show
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
up and wasn't that a great
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
trial of what happens when you decrease
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
tobacco taxes and again it kind of goes
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
to the point of why you need a
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
substantial increase when that 10 cent
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
decrease went into play it was supposed
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
to encourage more people to come to New
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the tobacco industry itself
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
raised the price of tobacco of
 
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
cigarettes nine cents a pack
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
following that 10 cent decrease so the
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
state did see a decrease in revenues and
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
the price stayed the same for the people
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
purchasing the tobacco products so yeah
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
so would you believe the take home is
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
it's best just to leave the thing alone
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
and not mess with it no it's always best
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
to increase it by at least a dollar a
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
pack and and also I just want to add for
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
that other tobacco product tax rate of
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
we have 65.03 percent of the wholesale
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
value of of otps is the tax rate on that
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
Maine has a lower tax rate of 43 percent
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
I believe on their otps so this is
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
another concern that I have for the way
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is set and obviously relying
 
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
on other states to help set our tobacco
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
tax rate is not the New Hampshire way
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's a little tacky isn't it
 
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.510 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's a little tacky isn't it
so

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah so again I encourage tobacco tax
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
increases meaningful levels great thank
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you Victor
 
00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:32.450 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you Victor
foreign

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
Pages here I'd like to read uh I know
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I don't know if
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm using yeah you want to be real close
 
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
I'm using yeah you want to be real close
okay

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony good
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm here uh representing myself my
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
small business and I'm with the New
 
00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Vapors Association
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping to offer a little food
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
for thought
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
pardon me if I'm stating the obvious
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
if it ain't broke don't fix it
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales are great
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts continues to shoot
 
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
themselves in the foot
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
as usual thank you for the business
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
but they created a much larger problem
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
and this time it's a little more than
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue
 
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
The Vapor Products Black Market
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is absolutely massive
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
and it's much larger than all of New
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Vape products sales combined
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
so instead of competing with legitimate
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
businesses we're competing with the
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
black market
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
if we increase prices right now tax
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
it'll just stimulate the black market
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
cost will go up here
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
people will decide to save a tank of gas
 
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.490 align:start position:0%
people will decide to save a tank of gas
instead

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
sounds familiar right
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine why anyone would
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
consider raising prices right now
 
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.149 align:start position:0%
consider raising prices right now
so

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
in relation to the bill from what I read
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
and what I understand
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good idea to not let
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
neighboring politicians
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
set the standard and decide what's right
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
they make a lot of mistakes
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
passing bills like this
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
will allow those mistakes to annually
 
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.789 align:start position:0%
will allow those mistakes to annually
compound

00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
compound
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a nightmare
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
so let's not play Follow the Leader off
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
the fiscal cliff
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
let's do what Massachusetts is doing
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
let's do what Maine and Vermont is doing
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a good idea
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
if there's one thing neighboring states
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
are good at
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's losing Revenue to New Hampshire
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
let's keep it that way
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
I think what's best for New Hampshire
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
right now is to kill the bill
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set thank you uh so
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
amazingly the Department of Revenue
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
Administration wants to
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
speak on the bill
 
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:17.049 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:32:17.049 --> 00:32:17.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
so theoretically they are neutral yes on
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Keen Ming Wong
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
Texas policy Council for the dra
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Lauren
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
O'Sullivan I'm a senior Financial
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
Analyst at the dra
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
and uh just to re reiterate uh the dra
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
does not have a position on this bill we
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
are here to answer uh questions we heard
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
that there were some questions on the
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
the fiscal fiscal note that we prepared
 
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:51.260 align:start position:0%
however we do also want to point out
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
that we do see some if the bill is to be
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
passed we do see some challenges in
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
terms of administering such as uh when
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
we see
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
some very some neighboring states taxed
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
the products differently compared to New
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we do see a bit of
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
challenges okay how do we compare that
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
and find which way how would we price
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
the tax to set the tax rate
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
um and if this legislation was passed we
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
would hope that there was some
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
clarifying language to be inserted into
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
the build for that as well and and as
 
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier in the one of the
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh the the tax rate
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
setting is done on an annual basis
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
um so probably uh additional like
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
researching what other tax or other
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
states are doing and um having to to set
 
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.070 align:start position:0%
states are doing and um having to to set
that

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
on a timely basis might be also slightly
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
um challenging
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
so the devil's in the details here
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:04.340 align:start position:0%
one more comment was
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
that uh that the bill required that the
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
the commissioner uh
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh sort of instruct on the current use
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
the current usage of the funds from
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
nicotine taxation
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
um the department currently does not
 
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:21.169 align:start position:0%
um the department currently does not
um

00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
does not have that function and we
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
normally once we collect the
 
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
the tax revenue that revenue is passed
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
on to the state treasurer and um
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
probably our suggestion is to consider a
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
a different agency who's more uh adapted
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
equipped with uh with the reporting on
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
the usage of the nicotine taxation so
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's section two of the bill is it yes
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah okay
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
I could see that being problematic okay
 
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much thank you
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%

the guts oh that's a z right okay see I
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
should have looked at it he didn't put
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%

00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
them live in New Hampshire
 
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:56.579 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
I oppose this because I think it gives
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
up our freedom to control our pricing I
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the right way to go I
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
don't want to be the test State
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
um the business has always been a roller
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
coaster in the state with tobacco tax
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
but right now we're on the top of the
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
roller coaster uh thanks to Charlie
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
Baker in Massachusetts for doing what
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
they did when they come over for
 
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.670 align:start position:0%
they did when they come over for
cigarettes

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
now because they you know they ban
 
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.790 align:start position:0%
now because they you know they ban
flavors

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
flavors
 
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:27.260 align:start position:0%
they buy beer they buy they go buy gas
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
I'm up 30 percent and if I'm up 30 the
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
state's got to be up
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
more you know what I mean the same so
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're pretty close and I just oppose
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
it because I think it we lose our
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
freedom to control pricing and we rely
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
on other states
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
and I've doubled my vehicles I've
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
doubled my employees I've never played
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
employees as much as I do today and I'm
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
able to you know so that's a good thing
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
I create jobs and um you know I'd like
 
00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
to keep on expanding uh if it's it's a
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable area that you never know
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen and also when
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
Charlie Baker raised that now you have
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
all these Massachusetts retailers coming
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
over which is providing more revenue for
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
example the town of Seabrook had five or
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
six smoke shops and now we have like a
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
dozen they're now trying to stop another
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
one from opening up because it's only
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
like a mile where they have to sell so
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's been a revenue generator for
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire I don't think
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
we should be the test state for this
 
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.690 align:start position:0%
we should be the test state for this
bill

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
see none so you know Charlie Baker is my
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
birth brother we were both born on the
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
exact same day so you know should be so
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
mean to him all right well I call him
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
the best government I ever had
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
even though he's not my Governor but
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you okay one
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
more card uh uh Burch Scott
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
when you cross your t's together that
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
looks like an H yeah so my name is Brett
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
Scott I'm the owner of Smokers Haven we
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
have 17 retail locations throughout New
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Maine and play over 140
 
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Maine and play over 140
people

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
I also represent the New Hampshire
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
Vapors Association which is comprised of
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
local small business owners such as
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
myself throughout New Hampshire
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation would
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
substantially increase select tobacco
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
and nicotine product taxes especially
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
that of vaping which would be nearly a
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
400 percent increase
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh by changing the tax to be slightly
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
lower than surrounding states it would
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
leave New Hampshire vulnerable to other
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
state legislation changes and lawmakers
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
that we do not elect the Department of
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration has stated that
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent of tobacco sales in the
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire are out of state
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
buyers by increasing the tax so
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
drastically the incentive for
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
out-of-state buyers should be lost and
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
there is not as much of a tax advantage
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
over surrounding states worthwhile
 
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
enough to make the cross-border trip
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
consider other Commodities if you can
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
get fuel on your way home but the next
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
town over is five cents cheaper would
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
you drive out of the way to save five
 
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.530 align:start position:0%
you drive out of the way to save five
cents

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
cents
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
now if you could save a dollar per
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
gallon would you take the slight
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
inconvenience to save fifteen dollars on
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
your fill up
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
reducing the incentive for consumers to
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
spend their money here in New Hampshire
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
not only will hurt these businesses
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
directly likely resulting in closures in
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
hardship due to lessened demand and an
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
already competitive market but also will
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
impact other businesses in nearby areas
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
that benefit from cross-border consumers
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
coming to these areas that then stop
 
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
shop spend money and support unrelated
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
other local businesses the importance of
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
out-of-state buyers in this industry
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be ignored the impact of reduced
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
demand directly affects the state's tax
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
revenue and local businesses for the tax
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
structure plays a pivotal role in
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
enticing consumers to save money by
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
making the trip to purchase these
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
products here in New Hampshire compared
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
to their home state
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
I hope you will consider the impacts
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
that such legislation would have on New
 
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

for quote serving an individual who is
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
visibly intoxicated
 
00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
or who are reasonable and prudent person
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
would know is intoxicated and such
 
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
intoxicated person directly causes the
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
serious injury or death of another
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
person or persons
 
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.829 align:start position:0%
person or persons
secondly

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
it changes the license suspension
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
to up to 30 Days quote up to 30 days
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to 10 consecutive days in
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission rules
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
third lastly
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
it requires the publishing
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
of the reason for the license suspension
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
so it would have to be posted on the
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
establishment's door if a license is
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
suspended the following verbiage quote
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
closed due to mandatory suspension by
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Liquor Commission for
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
over serving of alcohol in accordance
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
I've worked closely with the Liquor
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
Commission on the language of this bill
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
they do have some proposed amendments
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
minor but important ones of which I have
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely no problem with that I can
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
distribute their suggestions
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
I think they'll talk about it after my
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
testimony one of which for example is
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
the publishing of the notice that it be
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
on exterior doors exterior doors as mine
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
only says doors
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
certainly amenable to that
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
with that I ask that you pass this to
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
become the Elizabeth croak law formally
 
00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
and I'll conclude my testimony thank you
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members for your attention
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative Vinson has a question
 
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
Testimony taking my question so
 
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
um what's the magnitude of the problem
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
what is what is uh how how many
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
violations are per year
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna
 
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
for accuracy I'm going to defer that to
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission it could give you
 
00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:26.339 align:start position:0%
a good answer thank you
 
00:45:26.339 --> 00:45:27.349 align:start position:0%
a good answer thank you
okay

00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I'm curious how is
 
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:33.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I'm curious how is
it

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
when I read the bill it seems a little
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
subjective on how you decide who this is
 
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable but Prudence yeah that
 
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
somebody maybe is too drunk or
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
overserved but
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
like what is that standard so I mean I
 
00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.099 align:start position:0%
I my my cousin she manages a barn in
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
North Conway and she well a restaurant
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
not so much of a bar but they serve
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
alcohol and she says that you wouldn't
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
believe how often they find uh like beer
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
cans or nips in the bathroom and so you
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
know if I'm the bartender in that
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
situation and I have served somebody
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
two drinks and I think they're fine but
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
then they came in and drank a few to
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
save money
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
back in the bathroom or in the parking
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
lot before they came in you know at what
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
point do they
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
at what point are they like not
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
responsible for something that they
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
actually can't control or another
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
example would be what if they took a
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
Xanax or a couple of Xanax before it
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
came coming in which was another example
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
she gave me when I called her to talk
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
about this bill she said that actually
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
happened where people had taken Xanax
 
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
came in they had one drink became a mess
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't quite understand what was
 
00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
going on they found out later that they
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
the person had taken Xanax and they had
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
that in the system and interact with the
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol so I could see it in that case
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
it didn't go bad but I could see that
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
something like that happening where
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
the restaurants held accountable for
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
something that's really not their fault
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
so how does the bill deal with something
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and it's an
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
excellent one I had the same thoughts
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
coming up with this bill and working
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
with the croak family on it which is by
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
the way is going on almost two years
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
I would answer that question by saying
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
this first of all I would direct you to
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
current law RSA 179 colon 5 Roman one
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's standard
 
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
who a reasonable and prudent person
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
would know is intoxicated is already in
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
current law
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
my bill relates to the fines and to the
 
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.550 align:start position:0%
my bill relates to the fines and to the
publication

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
publication
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
and the suspension
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
not the standard
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
standards already there
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's the first part of my answer the
 
00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:50.099 align:start position:0%
second part is to inquire with the
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission they're the experts
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
let's face it and see what their
 
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
thoughts are with regards to what makes
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
that standard and how it's enforced okay
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative Terry thank you Mr
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
chairman uh forgive me if I've missed
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
this in Statewide news broadcasts or
 
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.190 align:start position:0%
this in Statewide news broadcasts or
articles

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
articles
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
um but what what's the the driver here
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
in on on the desire to uh to stiffen uh
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
the penalties
 
00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
um have have there been violations and
 
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
and you believe that the bar needs to be
 
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339 align:start position:0%
raised for violations and also for
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
deterrence purposes uh what why this why
 
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.990 align:start position:0%
deterrence purposes uh what why this why
now

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
I would say that the um impetus for the
 
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.410 align:start position:0%
I would say that the um impetus for the
bill

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
is the croak family and their personal
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
experience with this
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
and their journey through the process of
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
watching uh The Liquor Commission
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
enforce the current laws
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
and in my discussions with the croak
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
family whom you'll hear from this
 
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.470 align:start position:0%
family whom you'll hear from this
morning

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
they have expressed to me concern
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
that the fine was not enough
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
that publication was not adequate
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
and that suspension timing was also not
 
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.490 align:start position:0%
and that suspension timing was also not
adequate

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
following please further questions so
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
this is essentially the family the
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
affected family to which you to whom you
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
have already made reference and not any
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
particular incidents where there have
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
been violations and it is the it is the
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
opinion of of some that the bar should
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
be raised this is this is the family
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
only correct
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
and and and the opinion of others who
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
may be supportive of this for whatever
 
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.050 align:start position:0%
may be supportive of this for whatever
reasons

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
yes I've only worked with the family in
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission on this film
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
however I know that an incident was
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
highly publicized just as recent as last
 
00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.670 align:start position:0%
highly publicized just as recent as last
Thanksgiving

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving
 
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
very similar to this one I've not worked
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
with that family nor have I followed
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
that family's Journey
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
like I have the croaks
 
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay oh representative
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
the thing I keep thinking about is a
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
person who comes into a bar and maybe
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
has 10 vodka tonics and there's no
 
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.089 align:start position:0%
has 10 vodka tonics and there's no
visible

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
visible
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
signs of alcoholism they go out and have
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
a have a an accident where somebody gets
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
injured or killed and I mean this is and
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
as an example another example I I was
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
talking to my colleagues about it I'm
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
five feet tall if I have literally like
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
a quarter glass of wine I I'm
 
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
intoxicated which is why unfortunately I
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
can't drink very much so I mean how do
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
we deal with it should there also be a
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
cut off limit I mean does it make common
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
sense that somebody shouldn't be
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
drinking 10 vodka tonics and then going
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
out and driving even if they're not
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
certainly a good question a good concern
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
again I would defer to The Liquor
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
Commission my bill my work with the
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
croak family has been on the fines and
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
the penalties that they have experienced
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
in a very personal way
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
but your questions are very valid I'm
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
curious myself
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
but I would say let's ask those that are
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
most familiar and have enforced current
 
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.470 align:start position:0%
most familiar and have enforced current
law

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
related to these fines and penalties and
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
determinations of the standards and the
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
like and get their opinion on it
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and nice to see you
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you stated that
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
current law is 10 consecutive days for
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
the suspension
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
um and the bill says the bill says up to
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
30 days so my question is
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
does this allow for suspension of fewer
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
than 10 days which is current law
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
and is that judgment call left up to the
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative for the
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
question once again a good one I
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
referred in my testimony to Liquor
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
and yes I interpret it as you say up to
 
00:52:18.049 --> 00:52:18.059 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
that could be 10 that could be less my
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
interpretation is it's a Max of 30 but
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative Cole
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
just to touch on the subject a little
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
bit more I'm looking under the
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
methodology and then the first offense
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
says 10-day suspension and then a second
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
offense it says 30 to 60 days in my mind
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
that would make it mandatory
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 days in a second offense
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
so does this bill take the teeth out of
 
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.930 align:start position:0%
so does this bill take the teeth out of
it

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind me asking what exactly
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
are you looking at the methodology here
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
on the back page
 
00:52:58.809 --> 00:52:58.819 align:start position:0%
says as it stands right now
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
10-day suspension 2500 fine
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
and then the second offense five
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar suspension 30 to 60 days
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
for second events
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
those are actually up too
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
those are up to
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's up to
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
okay I've been counseled that someone
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
may have a better answer than I could
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
give thank you though for that uh
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%

thank you very much for sharing that
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
with us and is it possible that we can
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
have that text when I'm sure it's in the
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
permanent record yeah I just need I I
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you again for sharing your story
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I I'm so sorry to hear this story
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty it's pretty horrific
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
um my question for you is this bill
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
concentrates on somebody visibly
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and going back to the point
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
I made earlier
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
given what you said with the amount of
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
liquor that this this young man had over
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
a 90-minute period would you
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
would you think it would be helpful to
 
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
have an amendment into the bill to also
 
01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:29.579 align:start position:0%
monitor amounts
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
um because the bartender this in the
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
particular in this instance it seemed
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
like it was one bartender and knew
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
exactly how much was being consumed
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
I think it's just a combination of
 
01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
things I mean training has to be there I
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't you know in none of the employees
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
there were trained
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
I mean the bottom line is it's the
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility I mean it's a licensed
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
establishment it's their responsibility
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure that any Patron that leaves
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
that building is not intoxic is not
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and they they did not follow
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
through with that
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
follow up for the question so again do
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
you think particularly in this instance
 
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
that there should have been a limit set
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
by The Establishment or or whatever that
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
no you've had you've had your limit
 
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
we're shutting you off even if the
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
I would leave that up to the Liquor
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
Commission I don't have an answer for
 
01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.569 align:start position:0%
Commission I don't have an answer for
that

01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming in
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate it Mr chairman oh we I
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
believe I can direct my question to you
 
01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:36.059 align:start position:0%
so do I understand that licensing is
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
required but training is not required
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
under state law uh training is required
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's why that violation of of that was
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
why that when the penalties was was
 
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
livid because they had failed to do the
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
training had employees properly trained
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
and the maximum under the law we we've
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
already heard is 10 days and 2500
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%

01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
come before you to tell you what we
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
believe are shortfalls
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of great questions that
 
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:21.980 align:start position:0%
some of you saw me nodding in the back
 
01:06:25.329 --> 01:06:25.339 align:start position:0%
we can answer every one of them and and
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
probably give you some more insight on
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
top of that please with us I know this
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
group has never been bashful
 
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:34.210 align:start position:0%
group has never been bashful
um

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:34.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to be slighted by your
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions please ask us the toughest
 
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
questions you have because this is so
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
compelling of an issue and such a
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
horrific incident that occurred that we
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
need to do something about it so thank
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
you for that moment
 
01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:52.730 align:start position:0%
you for that moment
um

01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh this this issue has been so
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
compelling David and I met over the
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
phone and and had talked a handful of
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
times uh all ending in a very emotional
 
01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:07.549 align:start position:0%
times uh all ending in a very emotional
SOB

01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
SOB
 
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
um those of us who even don't have
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
children can really relate to what this
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
family has gone through
 
01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.569 align:start position:0%
family has gone through
um

01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
I will read you a position paper that
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to enter
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
um uh as that and also
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
um we have worked diligently with uh
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
um on some of the things that as we all
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
know in this commission this title 13 is
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
a permissive uh title if it doesn't say
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't exist it it you can't do
 
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
it so so with that in mind
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
um there were things that just needed
 
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
they were defined there were terms that
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
were defined that we needed to just
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
for a lack of a better term cleanup but
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
the liquor commissioned wholeheartedly
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh 150 percent uh supports this bill
 
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.410 align:start position:0%
uh 150 percent uh supports this bill
um

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
and increasing the penalties for
 
01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
on-premise over serving
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
um again I commend uh representative
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
Mooney and the croak family uh for for
 
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
just being brave and and bringing this
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
to attention this shortfall of
 
01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
accountability on the part of licensees
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
and death resulting and serious bodily
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
injury which are defined in statute
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh in these in these cases the proposed
 
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
changes on existing which you have
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
brought up on existing legislation
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
um will create the deterrent needed to
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are doing everything
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
right to keep our communities and the
 
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
industry safe while protecting as you
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
have heard me say before our vulnerable
 
01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:55.100 align:start position:0%
age group
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
the citizens of our state
 
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
rely on us to make sure when they are
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
traveling the highways and byways of
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
this great state or they're residing in
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
their communities that our servers are
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
serving correctly our serving
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
responsibly and those that are consuming
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
are doing that in the same fashion
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
at that point our training segments that
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
we offer that you've heard me testify to
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
time and time again
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
um are are just that and and they are
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
very extremely robust and robust Tool uh
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
a means of not only talking about those
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
mitigating and aggravating factors that
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have to take into account while we do
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
these investigations but looking at what
 
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
outward signs of intoxication which I
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
know was brought up
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
um which which is a
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
um a uh a built-in defense to the Statue
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
um so we'll we'll talk about all that as
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
we as we continue on here and Danielle
 
01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
will give us a a great oversight of that
 
01:10:08.699 --> 01:10:10.910 align:start position:0%
will give us a a great oversight of that
um

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
in conclusion with
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
um what we look at when it comes to
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
Lizzie's case
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
um when I walked in the door I I worked
 
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
half of my career at State Police those
 
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
28 years that I was over there working
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
homicide and I always said to the people
 
01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
that worked under my command we work on
 
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
behalf of the victims of this state
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
somebody has to speak on behalf of them
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
they're not here to speak on their
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
behalf we are in doing that as we walk
 
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
into this horrific incident that
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
happened with Lizzy
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
we see a driver driving the wrong way on
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
the highway we
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
have a head-on collision that
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
was so horrific with a fire that
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
there was there was no way of either
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
party surviving that crash at 80 miles
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
an hour the deterrent and and rightfully
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
so somebody brought up to turn the
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
deterrent needs to be there to hold
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
these people responsible we have
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
6400 licensees in this state
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
and Danielle will talk about it but last
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
year numbers wise
 
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.490 align:start position:0%
year numbers wise
three

01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
we held accountable under this statue
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
that came into this there for the most
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
part the majority is doing it right but
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
we have to keep in mind that there is
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
that small percentage that might not do
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
it right that we have to have that
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
deterrent there to hold them accountable
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
but in the in the interest of fairness
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of doing a thorough
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
investigation that will for a lack of a
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
better term weed out these the issues
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
that were rightfully brought up about
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
again mitigating circumstances and
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
aggravating circumstances outward signs
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
of intoxication because we're not
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
talking people that are are are trained
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
like police officers behind the counter
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
of a of a bars serving
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
um we're talking lay people we're
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
talking about our neighbors and uh what
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
is built into the law is that outward
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
signs of intoxication average outward
 
01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
signs of intoxication if they are not
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
being readily seen that is a defense
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
and and rightfully so or wrong
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
wrongfully so it is the way the statute
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
was written so
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
um with that in mind I I'd like to to
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
offer Danielle the opportunity to speak
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
on this this is an extremely emotional
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
um uh circumstance it's an extremely uh
 
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
emotionally for me to testify on this
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
because I can easily plug my family into
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
this every day of the week same age so
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
it really hits home so I appreciate the
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
time that each and every one of you are
 
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
giving to this uh listening and and
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
again I can't uh thank representative
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
Mooney and and her colleagues
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
um who who really cared enough to put
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
pen to paper on this to bring it in
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
front of this commission and thank you
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm going to try to uh
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
rapid fire answer some of the questions
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
that came up during the previous
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
testimony because I know there was
 
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
several different ones
 
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of how many licensees
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
affect you heard the chief in 2022 there
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
was three three licensees that would
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
fall under this seven in 2021 since 2008
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a total of 26 cases that
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
have resulted in serious bottle Lindsay
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
or death 15 of those were death
 
01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.149 align:start position:0%
or death 15 of those were death
resulting

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
resulting
 
01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
in terms of the statute in the language
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
as it sits right now the statute is
 
01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
currently the standard is visible signs
 
01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
of intoxication or a reasonable
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
imprudent person would know was
 
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
intoxicated in that reasonable imprudent
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
person standard we consider rate of
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
service in our investigation what were
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
the drinks sold what was the size of the
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
drinks what was the alcohol content in
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
the drinks how fast they were served and
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
how fast they were consumed those are
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
all things that are investigated and
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
considered when we're doing these
 
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
investigations and that falls the rate
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
of service falls under the reasonable
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
important person standard in terms of
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that that you had
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
brought up that individuals might be
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
bringing alcohol into the establishment
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
or taking you know
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
um intoxicating medication prior to
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
those are also things that are
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
investigated in our investigations so we
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
do in most of these cases conduct close
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
to what a 24-hour background would be
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
from a police department standard we
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
look at what they consumed prior to
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
going there are they taking medications
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
the effects those medications could have
 
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
we look at their regular behaviors we
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
talk to friends and family as to how
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
they normally acted were they acting
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
differently in the establishment so all
 
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
those are are considered in the
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
investigation of if somebody was visibly
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
intoxicated or that a reasonable
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
important person would know is
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and we have had
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances where on face value it
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
would appear that the establishment did
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
over serve the person but the
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
investigation concluded that they had
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know been drinking at a prior
 
01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:41.300 align:start position:0%
establishment and or taken medication
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
which then the establishment wasn't held
 
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
accounted accountable because we
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
recognize that the visible signs were
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
not not from their rate of service or
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
the service of alcohol but from the
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
medication that they took
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
these are all things that are also
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
addressed in our server and management
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
training those trainings are provided
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
monthly throughout the state they're
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
also available online to all licensed
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
establishments they're free of charge so
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
we the majority of that training
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
addresses visible signs of intoxication
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
and the reasonable imprudence person's
 
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.689 align:start position:0%
and the reasonable imprudence person's
standard

01:16:16.689 --> 01:16:16.699 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you have does address
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
first offenses and then multiple
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
offenses after that so currently in rule
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
you're corrected as the first offense is
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
the 10 consecutive days with the twenty
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollar fine and then it
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
moves to a 30 to 60 day suspension the
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
amendment increases it from to a minimum
 
01:16:37.689 --> 01:16:37.699 align:start position:0%
of 30 days
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
for the first offense but allows for up
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
um did I miss any any more questions
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
that I I don't I hope I covered them all
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
we'll start with representative Sullivan
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
since that was his first question thank
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
you um so
 
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
I do have a question on one scenario
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
that we haven't talked about is so what
 
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
happens if you have a bar that has or an
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
establishment that has multiple bars in
 
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
it and so therefore you have a bartender
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
on one side a bartender or another maybe
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
there's a third or fourth bar I mean
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
I've been to larger cities anyways where
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
there's seven bars within one
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
establishment and so theoretically if
 
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
you went to each one of those seven bars
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sticking up thinking of a specific
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
one I've been to in my past in Chicago
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
which obviously wouldn't apply here
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
being New Hampshire but if you had a
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
similar type of place in the state of
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and somebody goes to each
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
one of those bars and gets one drink is
 
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
there a way for a bartender to be held
 
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
accountable if they thought they were
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
maybe giving that person the first drink
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a busy bar and you know they
 
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
don't have a chance to really examine
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
them because there's three or four
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
hundred people in there so they're just
 
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
going as fast as they can and that
 
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
person's now had their seventh drink or
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they've gone and had two drinks at
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
each bar and so everybody thinks oh this
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
is just their second drink second time
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
I've seen them I mean it seems like that
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
would be over serving from The
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
Establishment perspective but how would
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
they really monitor something like that
 
01:17:59.689 --> 01:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
and and how would you guys deal with
 
01:17:59.699 --> 01:18:00.350 align:start position:0%
and and how would you guys deal with
that

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's possibility that the
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
establishment could be held accountable
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
for the over service of that individual
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
um we tend we have we recommend
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
responsible business practices but we
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
don't manage or regulate the way the
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
licensee runs their business so if a
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
license you choose chooses to have
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
several bars that is a situation that we
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
would bring up to them but it's up to
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
the licensee to determine the best way
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
for them to manage their establishment
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
so that somebody does not get over
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
served but there is a very likely
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
possibility that the more the larger
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
your establishment is the more the more
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
bars you have the more points of service
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
that you have that there is the
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
possibility that an over service is more
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
likely so if someone were to go into the
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
establishment and go to Every bar in
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
Rapid Fire and and you know be served to
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
drink and they at some point become
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
visibly intoxicated or the rate of
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
service was Nest that a reasonable
 
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
person should have known then yes it is
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
a possibility that the establishment
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
could be held responsible for that
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative Terry
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.209 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
I was the one who questioned and about
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
deterrence raising the bar for
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
deterrence I'm also concerned about
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
plugging holes
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
that may exist and as I'm listening to
 
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
all of this I'm hearing that number one
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
the the the bartender
 
01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
fled to New York is is that is that
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
correct and I'm wondering
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
um are there and even in regardless of
 
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
whether you know that's to be the case
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
are there tools that you have in your
 
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.390 align:start position:0%
are there tools that you have in your
toolbox

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
toolbox
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
such that you can make the the person
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
this individual would you hypothetically
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
been able to make that person
 
01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.030 align:start position:0%
been able to make that person
accountable

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
for the actions that she took uh on that
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
evening and more broadly
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
um in response to the question that I
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
posed to the chairman the chairman
 
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
responded to me that training is
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
required as a part of Licensing
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
do you have the tools to enforce
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
penalties upon institutions
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
establishments if they are found to have
 
01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
establishments if they are found to have
not

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
completed training requirements for
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
their employees and is there such a
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
range so that you have the opportunity
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
because we can't we can't uh legislate
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
for every particular situation but is
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
there a range such that you could
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
administer a fine or actually in a
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
situation like this have considered
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
revoking the license of the
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
establishment because the owner of the
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
establishment did not follow through and
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
require that the employee actually
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
receive the required training
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
So yeah thank you for your question um
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
right now as the statue is in regards to
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
training a member of management has to
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
attend training prior to the license
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
being issued that is the only statutory
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for training for licensees
 
01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
so the licensee can designate uh what
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
themselves or a member of management to
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
attend a training within 45 days of the
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
license being issued there is no
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
requirement for employees of the
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.570 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:28.580 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
for the question in in light of the
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
statistics and uh that you have cited
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
and the particular cases over the last
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
several years do you believe that that
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
might be a useful tool in your toolbox
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
to be able to require that
 
01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
establishments required training of
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
their employees I I think that's a great
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
question representative and I I can't
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
tell you how much I appreciate it uh it
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
creates another conversation
 
01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
and and a very good one
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I'd I'd like to hear about the impact
 
01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:04.580 align:start position:0%
on industry but anytime there are
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
legislative mandatory uh uh hard decks
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
let's call them
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
um uh that that fortifies a training
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
element to do it right I think that's
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
good business
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
um we in the last six years
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
um that that's our platform I know you
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
um we we have been successful in doing
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
business that way
 
01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:34.250 align:start position:0%
business that way
um

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
as you know also that as we as we're
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the statutes that are in
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
title uh 13 that and rule that there are
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
some that we we want to make better and
 
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is one of them uh when I walked in
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
the door and I walked into a case on the
 
01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:57.260 align:start position:0%
Seacoast uh involving one of our license
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
establishments that was three years old
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and you ask yourself why three years
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
because prosecution criminal prosecution
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
had asked us to wait on our
 
01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
administrative role
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
um we we weren't doing business like
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
we're doing it now we were doing it to
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
our administrative ability
 
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh which is a preponderance of the of
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
the evidence and not by the way of
 
01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt because I felt
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
coming from the traditional world of law
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement that we were going to end up
 
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
in court a lot and and if we were and if
 
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
we had law enforcement throughout this
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
state Municipal law enforcement and
 
01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:46.790 align:start position:0%
state Municipal law enforcement and
State

01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh buying into the way we were doing
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
business then we were going to have to
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
do business and ultra high standard and
 
01:23:57.610 --> 01:23:57.620 align:start position:0%
do our due diligence in investigating
 
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
every possible means of how something
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
either went right
 
01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
or how it went wrong it's not always
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
negative like this case
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
and and there have been several
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
establishments that we have cleared of
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing when it looked like they were
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
doing it wrong and they weren't because
 
01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.010 align:start position:0%
doing it wrong and they weren't because
of

01:24:15.010 --> 01:24:15.020 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
prescription medication or
 
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
non-prescription medication being on
 
01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.610 align:start position:0%
non-prescription medication being on
board

01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh of the the target of the
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
investigation so
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
so yes I a long way to get to your
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
answer but yes
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
um I believe so
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative uh post
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
my question was thank you very much and
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
um my question was answered
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
um but I have a follow-up to that why is
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
it up to 30 days why isn't it the 30
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
days right off the bat because that's a
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
huge deterrent to have your
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
establishment closed
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
for that long though those were those
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:24:59.159 --> 01:25:00.709 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:00.719 --> 01:25:01.450 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:01.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
amongst as you know how these go
 
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
um a lot of conversations I could tell
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
you a lot of conversations went into
 
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
what you have before you and what what
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
is proposed uh by representative Mooney
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
um that was one of the things that was
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
spoken about uh in our conversations
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we're there yet to be
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
quite honest about it uh totally
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
transparent but this is a very firm step
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
forward in doing business right
 
01:25:41.689 --> 01:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
and and that deterrent is is real
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
um if the deterrent of 30 days up to 30
 
01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
days is out there I believe that our
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
licensees who aren't doing business
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
right and I'm I I will attest in any
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
court of law or in front of any
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
committee that a majority of our
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
licensees do it right and and I'm very
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
humbled and proud of that because
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
they've very quickly bought into what
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
what we have spoken to them about that
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
that training and and education is
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
Paramount and and good and reasonable
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
and responsible service
 
01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.530 align:start position:0%
and responsible service
um

01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
but with that in mind those were
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
conversations that were brought up uh
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
during during talks over this bill and
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
and we felt that this was a solid step
 
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.689 align:start position:0%
and we felt that this was a solid step
forward

01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
I can't follow up okay so who makes the
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
determination of how many days 10 days
 
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
15 days 20 days
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
great question representative so
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
um we look at the mitigating uh of
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
course and aggravating factors
 
01:26:59.689 --> 01:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
um in determining what time we were
 
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
going to select for uh imposing
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
accountability uh in any case
 
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't know why this part of
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
the process gets lost sometimes there is
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
due process in all of our cases so even
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
though we are pushing for let's say we
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
do 30 days a licensee has due process
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
and can go into our hearing process in
 
01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:26.540 align:start position:0%
front of our hearings
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
officer and and plead their case of why
 
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
they believe that we we went too high
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
let's say or or you know the the
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
accountability or the what they did
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
wrong doesn't equal the accountability
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
that they've been afforded
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
um with that in mind again it's good
 
01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.290 align:start position:0%
um with that in mind again it's good
business

01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
allowing our our business partners to
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
have that ability to come in and state
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
their case
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
um and and that happens on not often
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
um because we don't have these cases
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
often but we are prepared for those
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
cases as often as they may happen and I
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
hope they happen zero uh but we're we're
 
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
prepared to handle those
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs
 
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh can you tell us what the
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
penalties are in neighboring states for
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
we can find that out for you I don't
 
01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:29.900 align:start position:0%
have that information readily available
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
for you um Massachusetts is not a
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
controlled State
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
um so their penalties are typically
 
01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:39.860 align:start position:0%
regulated by the local
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
licensing boards
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
um but Vermont
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
um is a controlled State and we'll have
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
something similar as well as Maine so we
 
01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
can get the we can get that for you
 
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so I remind the
 
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
members we will be going to subcommittee
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
on this bill all right representative
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
Ammon is next
 
01:28:59.450 --> 01:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
testimony and taking our questions
 
01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear for the record
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
are you promoting or uh
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the amendment that's
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
before us yes okay
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so this is your position on what the
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill should look like correct all right
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
so my question has to do with um
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh allowing latitude to the Department
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
comparing current statute with what
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
you're proposing here
 
01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
and going back to the methodology
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
section I think representative Cole
 
01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
there's three different tiers to the
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
penalties in current statute
 
01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:41.990 align:start position:0%
penalties in current statute
um

01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
the first one is a fine of 2500 10 day
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
suspension that's the first offense
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
correct the second offense is 5 000 and
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
a suspension of 30 to 60 days
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
so 30 to 60 that gives you that Latitude
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
correct correct and then the an
 
01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
additional offense so a third offense
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
revocation of the license correct so you
 
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
stated that the title is a permissive
 
01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:09.950 align:start position:0%
stated that the title is a permissive
chapter

01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
so if if you're if it states what the
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
department is allowed to do you can't do
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
anything else besides that so
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
those are three tiers the third one is a
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
mandatory revocation and the current or
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that you're proposing
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
it talks about a fine of seventy five
 
01:30:31.689 --> 01:30:31.699 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars so from
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
2500 first offense
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
5000 second offense now it's a mandatory
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
7 500 for each offense is that correct
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
am I reading that right correct
 
01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
and then it says up to 30 days so you
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
your discretion is 0 to 30 days
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
of suspension
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
which is different
 
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
and then it says up to revocation so
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
according to this language there could
 
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
be ten offenses and revocation still is
 
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
not mandatory wherein current statute
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
it's mandatory on the third offense is
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is that correct in the plane
 
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.290 align:start position:0%
that is that correct in the plane
reading

01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm choosing 10 as a number you know
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
as a yeah in plain reading correct you
 
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
are correct in that
 
01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.209 align:start position:0%
are correct in that
um

01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:20.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
the so 179 57 uh requires that
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
aggravating and mitigating factors are
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
taking into account during the issuance
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
of penalties and or suspensions
 
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.510 align:start position:0%
of penalties and or suspensions
so

01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
um that is the that's the those are the
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
factors that are are included when we're
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
looking at what those penalties would be
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
so part of the issue you have with your
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
first offense and that that is the
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
penalty no matter what doesn't matter
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
what your aggravating factors are it
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what your mitigating
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
factors are everybody's getting this
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's fine and then but also the
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
closure of the business those are part
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the same correct correct so in the
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
current one that you're reading the 10
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
days and 2500 that's the penalty right
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
no matter what doesn't matter the
 
01:32:07.129 --> 01:32:07.139 align:start position:0%
circumstances doesn't matter the
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors the license does
 
01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to the aggravating
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
factors a license C has it doesn't allow
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
for anything other than the 10 days and
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
the 2500.
 
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
um so the idea of this is that this
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
allows for those aggravating and
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors to be taken into
 
01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
account with a maximum of 30. anything
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
after that
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
um because again for us it's concerning
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a second offense
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
that results in serious bodily injury or
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
death that would allow us to again
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
assess the situation the case specific
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
facts account for those aggravating
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
communicating factors and determine are
 
01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
we at a point where they can continue to
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
operate or is revocation necessary at
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
this point so just back to my
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
but I guess a
 
01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
can you shut the business down
 
01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
is it in the statue that you can just
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
shut it down can you just pull their
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
license because you just say this is so
 
01:33:07.139 --> 01:33:08.750 align:start position:0%
license because you just say this is so
egregious

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
egregious
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
I don't see that in here no
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
all right so clearly this statute needs
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
to be fixed
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
okay everybody all right clearly we need
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
to fix the statute so we are going to
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
work on it but we're getting a little
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
behind on the time and I'm a little
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
worried that that we're not going to
 
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
solve everything at this moment at this
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
hearing but I think what we've got is we
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
know there's a problem here and we've
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
got to fix this
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative McAleer do you agree
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
I agree but I would like to make a
 
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
comment if I could this is a would you
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
believe this is actually a would you
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
believe and it goes along with
 
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Terry I actually queried
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
a bartender recently about any training
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
that they had and uh she looked at me
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
like what are you kidding me I asked if
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
management had ever said anything about
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
this and the answer was no and the other
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
answer was well it gets so busy in here
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
we got you know five or six different
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
waitresses waiters around
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
um it would be very difficult to monitor
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is that this uh this could
 
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
be a deterrent or should be a deterrent
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
to get management to uh to talk about it
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
at least and not and actually I really
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
think it the training should be
 
01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
mandatory for for bartenders thank you
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay we all said everyone
 
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
all right we will close the public
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh I would say a note that
 
01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.270 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh I would say a note that
um

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh the over overnight we had two in
 
01:34:42.129 --> 01:34:42.139 align:start position:0%
support and three opposed
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the blue blue sheets is uh
 
01:34:50.290 --> 01:34:50.300 align:start position:0%
everyone is in support that includes
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%

01:35:04.129 --> 01:35:04.139 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
and give everybody a moment here so that
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:44.450 align:start position:0%
okay

yeah yeah just hand it hand it just hand
 
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
get into the hot seat which I assume it
 
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
must be very warm by now
 
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:22.860 align:start position:0%

all right you're on good morning my name
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
is Kristen Apollo Stacy and um here to
 
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
justify for my dad
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and Apollo Vineyards and I'm really
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
shaky really oh sorry okay
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for hearing my testimony
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
today I could be not I could not be
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
there in person so I asked my daughter
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
Kristen to read this testimony I'm
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
asking that you hear and understand when
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
the open minds towards supporting local
 
01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:49.970 align:start position:0%
the open minds towards supporting local
farming

01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
farming
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
I realized some education is in order
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
because the Taxation and fee structure
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
levied on wine producers is spread
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
across multiple rsas many of my
 
01:37:59.689 --> 01:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
Representatives who I've discussed this
 
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
legislation were unaware of implications
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
of the current law
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
one of the details is a fuscated in the
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
current law by calling an excise tax a
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
five percent fee in the RSA
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
currently wiring rates are paying five
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
percent on Top Line Sales to The Liquor
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
Commission and we're required to add 8.5
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
meals tax anything consumed at the
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
winery both food and wine tastings this
 
01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:25.139 align:start position:0%
sets attacks on the glass of wine at
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
13.5 percent a five percent portion
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
amounts to a hidden sales tax in 2012
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue stated started
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
demanding meals tax on wine samples
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
consumed at The Tasting Room this was
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
without any legislation or recourse to
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
the wineries now required to pay it
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
the current state of Taxation on wine
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
producers is unsustainable if you want
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
to grow the wine industry in the state
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
only one Vineyard and Winery in the
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire of which I'm
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
aware has been produced purchased from a
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
founder two other wineries closed when
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
their Founders decided to move on one
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
Vineyard is was torn out this is a tough
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
sell point for people wanting to enter
 
01:39:05.209 --> 01:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
this business
 
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
the brewery business by contrast is
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
thriving the state because they're taxed
 
01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
at a reasonable level does this mean we
 
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
should tax breweries more definitely not
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
they are providing full-time employment
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
for hundreds of people by eliminating
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
wine catering and restaurant jobs I
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
would estimate between 50 to 70
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
full-time employees are employed in New
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wineries many of these are
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
owners themselves I am one full-time
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
person I'm the only full-time person at
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
my Winery
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
also by contrast no significant raw
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
materials for beer or beer are grown in
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire planting of wine groups
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
are expanding every year the founders of
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
several of the largest wineries in the
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
state have paved the way with wine
 
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
Styles and grape varieties that they can
 
01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
grow here and support viable businesses
 
01:39:50.209 --> 01:39:50.219 align:start position:0%
all of the varieties on my farm are
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
grown without chemical sprays in fact
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
the winery was just recently recognized
 
01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
by the first sustainable craft beverage
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
Winery in New Hampshire by nhdes due to
 
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
the environmental practices
 
01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
some of this inequity between beer and
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
wine has come about because the current
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
rsas for the wine industry are spread
 
01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:13.139 align:start position:0%
across multiple sections of RSA 178 the
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
fee and tax Schedule should be
 
01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
rationalized and made Equitable for
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
similar alcoholic beverages taxes should
 
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
be less listed as taxes the RSA 178
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
for example a 750 milliliter bottle of
 
01:40:33.490 --> 01:40:33.500 align:start position:0%
beer at 11 alcohol sold by volume at 13
 
01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:36.179 align:start position:0%
produced in a brewery in Dairy is taxed
 
01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
at six cents a 750 milliliter bottle of
 
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
wine at 11 alcohol
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
sold at 13 is taxed at 65 cents
 
01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
the wine is grown on the same property
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
as the winery by the way wine is taxed
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
at a percentage of bottle price beer is
 
01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
taxed by volume you can see the more
 
01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.219 align:start position:0%
than 10 discrepancy in the tax and the
 
01:40:56.219 --> 01:40:57.169 align:start position:0%
than 10 discrepancy in the tax and the

01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
graphic
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
shown here
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
our most current expensive wine at
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
thirty dollars a bottle has a 1.50
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
I would like to refer to RSA 425 colon 2
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%

what we'll sell is wine

grapevines are perennial plant that

thirsty for locally grown wines
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
I'm actively working with fruit farmers
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
to plant varieties of grapes that can
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
turn into wines increasing production
 
01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
means more jobs for both farm and Winery
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
lower carbon usage for wine production
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
and the development of full career
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
Fields within the state carbon usage is
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
decreased with great when grapes are
 
01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.219 align:start position:0%
grown to where they are turned into wine

in other states wine excise Texas is

01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
bill for wine is only about 20 percent
 
01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:34.980 align:start position:0%

01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
having current limits of consumption on
 
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
the RSA are not constructive we are now
 
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
required to have food in order to serve
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
more than a single glass of wine by the
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
glass we have 15 wines on our menu we
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
legally serve two ounces of each wine to
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
a single person as a tasting this is 30
 
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
ounces of wine more than a bottle we
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
would never do such a thing
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
our staff is trained not to over serve
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
customers and turn away intoxicated
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
people arriving at the winery it is the
 
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility of each owner to ensure
 
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
the rules are followed the key one being
 
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
that customers are not overserved
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
customers often often arrive at our
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
Winery that have already been to served
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we turn them away offered to
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
call them an Uber and produce or produce
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
a designated driver
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
if you read our Google one star reviews
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see how unhappy some of them are
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
the limits should be reasonable ones
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
two six ounce glasses of wine or a
 
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
bottle for two people nearly identical
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
pores of wine for a couple on a date
 
01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
for people enjoying a farm setting such
 
01:44:46.129 --> 01:44:46.139 align:start position:0%
as ours this makes them repeat customers
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
I realize I haven't touched on some of
 
01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
the issues within HP 612 and also
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
believe that others should be discussed
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
to summarize my request call a tax
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
attacks in the RSA excise tax is
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
currently called a five percent fee nhlc
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
auditing web page uses the term tax on
 
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
their web page
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
elimination of the double taxation on
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
samples and e-wine served by removing
 
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:11.820 align:start position:0%
the excise tax paid to nhlc in favor of
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
the meals tax
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
allow for couples or larger groups to
 
01:45:18.649 --> 01:45:18.659 align:start position:0%
enjoy a bottle of wine at the winery to
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
be at a parody with neighboring states
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
especially Massachusetts
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
drop the excise tax on wine make it
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
Equitable to the Brewing industry even
 
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
50 cents a gallon is much lower than we
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
were paying five percent on Top Line
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
Sales as a hidden sales tax Lord the
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
lower the number the better
 
01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:39.179 align:start position:0%

you made it you need it good job
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
any questions yeah so I just want to let
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know that uh it was very intriguing
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
to read this is for someone who's been
 
01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
around here a long time and to uh we we
 
01:46:45.290 --> 01:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
have actually in the beer industry you
 
01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
know we have Nanos which are not fewer
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturers you know beverage
 
01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
manufacturers they're a nano so clearly
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh a a farmer who's making wine and has
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
no idea intent to bottle it and have it
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
sold through the Liquor Commission in
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
the first place okay then you are in my

mind you are a nano
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
two all right well why Nano and so I
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
would say that we would definitely want
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
to address this issue and and uh
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%

01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Liquor Commission
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement and Licensing
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
certainly we appreciate this bill coming
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
forward in in the testimony provided by
 
01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:18.179 align:start position:0%
Apollo Vineyards
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
um we are very committed to the
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with our licensees and
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
looked at having all of these issues
 
01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:26.930 align:start position:0%
looked at having all of these issues
addressed

01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
um to give you a uh systematic approach
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
here to the impact that these changes
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
would have
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
um starting first with the language of
 
01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:41.639 align:start position:0%
changing uh the sample size from the
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
five ounce to six ounce
 
01:48:48.649 --> 01:48:48.659 align:start position:0%
a standard uh 750 milliliter bottle of
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
wine is approximately 25 ounces so with
 
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
increasing this to the six ounces for
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
two people that's two glasses of wine
 
01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
per each person that's 24 ounces that's
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
an entire bottle of wine there and I'm
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
sure that was the intent of increasing
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
it from the five to six ounces
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to that the next section
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
here which states the full unopened
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
bottle wines of groups of two or more
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
persons of legal drinking age
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's increasing the number of bottles
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
of wine that can be served to uh
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
individuals of groups of two or more
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
with no limit on that so
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
I think what should be examined here is
 
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
by the legislators is the intent of the
 
01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:36.169 align:start position:0%
by the legislators is the intent of the
sampling

01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.179 align:start position:0%
sampling
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
right so what this essentially is doing
 
01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
is making a wine bar
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
instead of a sample the intent always
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
was interpreted of the samples for B to
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
be promotional to be able to sample the
 
01:49:53.450 --> 01:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
product before buying it
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
we're moving away from that in this
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
legislation into a a wine bar now I will
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
keep uh everybody informed here with as
 
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
Provisions that already exist in the
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
statute that each wine manufacturer has
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
an option of obtaining an on-premises
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
license which is a restaurant license
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
this would alleviate that they wouldn't
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
be required to get the on-premises
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
license right which has the requirements
 
01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
of uh food requirements in in such they
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
would just be able to operate
 
01:50:30.530 --> 01:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
a wine bar under these the provisions of
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
this statute this change in the statute
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
moving along in the changes um starting
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
with the notwithstanding uh any other
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
provision allow open and unfinished
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
bottles of wine provided this is
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
referring to the transportation of the
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
uh open bottles of wine
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
and this is standard language that
 
01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:51.659 align:start position:0%
exists in other statutes it's just a
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
legal way of being able to transport
 
01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
open bottles of wine
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
moving on to paragraph four uh in
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
reference to the status in the uh the um
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
fee changes
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
um We examined the 2021 figures
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the revenue and in 2021
 
01:51:18.010 --> 01:51:18.020 align:start position:0%
for the wine manufacturers
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh the division collected
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand three hundred
 
01:51:25.129 --> 01:51:25.139 align:start position:0%
sixty seven thousand ninety five dollars
 
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
in in Revenue
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
the wine that was produced based on the
 
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
existing language of the uh
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
five percent of the sales
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
if the proposed tax structure was in
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
place for the same time frame the taxes
 
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
that would have been collected during
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
the same time is 47 790.
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that's a reduction of approximately
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
87 percent in revenue or
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
three hundred and nineteen thousand
 
01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:03.050 align:start position:0%
three hundred and nineteen thousand
dollars

01:52:03.050 --> 01:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
continuing on with the wine sales
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
consumed on the premises under paragraph
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
three shall be exempt from the tax and
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
subject to the uh meals and rooms tax
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
under RSA 78a
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
if this was enacted it would equate to
 
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
approximately another one percent or
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
thirty six hundred dollar loss in
 
01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:27.590 align:start position:0%
thirty six hundred dollar loss in
Revenue

01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
and finally the addition of paragraph
 
01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:31.669 align:start position:0%
and finally the addition of paragraph
nine

01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
where wine manufacturers May exempt up
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
to 100 gallons per year for a household
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
with one person and up to 200 gallons of
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
wine per year for a household with two
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
or more people
 
01:52:44.689 --> 01:52:44.699 align:start position:0%
from the tax
 
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
based on the 2021 figures this would
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
affect seven out of the then 47
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
licensees wine manufacturers that we
 
01:52:53.159 --> 01:52:53.930 align:start position:0%
licensees wine manufacturers that we
have

01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
and would equate to another loss of
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to answer any questions
 
01:53:09.010 --> 01:53:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else would like to testify on
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
how spill
 
01:53:18.649 --> 01:53:18.659 align:start position:0%

um anyway HB foreign 459 is intended to
 
01:55:02.209 --> 01:55:02.219 align:start position:0%
correct an overly broad exemption to our
 
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
which has weakened consumers rights to
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
redress from harm and hurt New Hampshire
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
businesses who do not seek to gain an
 
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
unfair Market advantage through
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
deceptive practices and fraudulent
 
01:55:14.219 --> 01:55:15.830 align:start position:0%
deceptive practices and fraudulent
Behavior

01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
the exemption to the consumer protection
 
01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:21.179 align:start position:0%
act enacted in 2002 led to a weakened
 
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement regime in New Hampshire
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
which resulted in scandals such as the
 
01:55:27.649 --> 01:55:27.659 align:start position:0%
frm Ponzi scheme
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh costing consumers millions of dollars
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
in our state its reputation as a place
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
to do honest business
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
the ambitious sweep of the 2002
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
exemption effectively made our consumer
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
protection act unenforceable by private
 
01:55:43.729 --> 01:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
citizens and the State against the host

take some kind of action
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
previous to the consumer act exemptions
 
01:56:20.209 --> 01:56:20.219 align:start position:0%
in 2002 industry was subject to

enforcement actions not only by the
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
state but also by private citizens
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
bringing suit for harms against them in
 
01:56:28.850 --> 01:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
the courts and recouping their attorney

fees from the guilty parties
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
this bill HP 459 seeks to return New
 
01:56:38.090 --> 01:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to that atmosphere of
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
increased enforcement by allowing our
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
state agencies the Attorney General's
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
office once again to take enforcement
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
actions and to allow private citizens
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
harmed by corporate Bad actors to seek
 
01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
redress in the courts on their own and
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
not have to depend on Big Brother to
 
01:56:56.689 --> 01:56:56.699 align:start position:0%
come to their rescue
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
as written HB 459 would empower the
 
01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
agencies and the AG's office to issue a
 
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
right to sue letter to harm consumers
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
with legitimate cases thus saving the
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
state money enhancing the enforcement
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
regime against unscrupulous actors and
 
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
empowering private citizens
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
to seek Justice on their own terms
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
however uh
 
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
recently a defect in this bill as his
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
pre as is currently drafted was brought
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
to my attention uh this bill as drafted
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
would release private citizens from the
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
exemption and allow them to take
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions but it would not do
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
the same thing for the state and its
 
01:57:38.639 --> 01:57:40.310 align:start position:0%
the same thing for the state and its
agencies

01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
so in the interest of Simplicity and in
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
order to empower the state once again to
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
enforce our consumer protection act I
 
01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
would like to offer an amendment
 
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
to the bill as it now stands and get it
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
to your committee before you meet on
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
Executive session for this bill and that
 
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
would simply be to repeal the exemption
 
01:58:02.810 --> 01:58:02.820 align:start position:0%
in other words to
 
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
get rid of all the italicized language
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
and just strike Roman numeral one
 
01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:12.179 align:start position:0%
from the bill as it now stands in other
 
01:58:12.179 --> 01:58:13.370 align:start position:0%
from the bill as it now stands in other
words

01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
the activities that we're most concerned
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
with would no longer be exempt
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
from enforcement action by the state or
 
01:58:22.609 --> 01:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
by private citizens
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay so you you do realize that the
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
entities that are exempt have the same
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
powers of restitution
 
01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
that the consumer protection act has
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
can you can you can you powers of
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
restitution in other words the purpose
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection act was to if
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
a consumer's been harmed or that they
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
get their money back right
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay yes is the triple damages but
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the whole thesis was get
 
01:58:56.930 --> 01:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
your money back so those Exempted
 
01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:58.310 align:start position:0%
your money back so those Exempted
entities

01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
all four of them now have the same power
 
01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
restitution they can make the consumer
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
whole they can get the consumer get
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
their money back
 
01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
yes I understand that but from my
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
understanding they cannot use the
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act as one of their
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
tools no they have their own statute
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
each one of them has it in their statute
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
right this ability to make the consumer
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
a whole I understand that
 
01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
so what's the problem
 
01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
we have a consumer protection act which
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
is unenforceable well the consumer
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
protection act was designed to pick up
 
01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
where these that those individual
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
Apartments didn't have already have so
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
the idea of the consumer protection act
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
is all those other things other than
 
01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
banking Insurance utilities and
 
01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:45.169 align:start position:0%
banking Insurance utilities and
securities

01:59:45.169 --> 01:59:45.179 align:start position:0%
securities
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
have some way to make the consumer whole
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
but that when it comes to those four
 
01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:52.729 align:start position:0%
but that when it comes to those four
entities

01:59:52.729 --> 01:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer all has to do is call the
 
01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:56.510 align:start position:0%
the consumer all has to do is call the
commissioner

01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner will make them
 
01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.350 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner will make them
whole

02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
and doesn't need the consumer protection
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
act to make them whole
 
02:00:08.109 --> 02:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
he has his own neck or the she excuse me
 
02:00:10.729 --> 02:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I'm not a lawyer so I'm
 
02:00:13.010 --> 02:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
not going to debate the legality of of
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
how the consumer protection act is
 
02:00:16.970 --> 02:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
enforced I mean that that might be or
 
02:00:18.649 --> 02:00:18.659 align:start position:0%
might not be I know we have a consumer
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
protection act and it's unforceable at
 
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
the moment and by the Attorney General's
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
office and the other Regulatory Agencies
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
when they want to go after uh payday
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
lenders when they want to go after car
 
02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
dealers when they want to go after
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
financial advisors who have acted
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
fraudulently okay so they'll be just
 
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
clear because I was in the room when it
 
02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:35.270 align:start position:0%
clear because I was in the room when it
happened

02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
the car dealers are carved out only to
 
02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
the extent of when they'd fill out the
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
paperwork for you to get your car
 
02:00:43.199 --> 02:00:44.689 align:start position:0%
paperwork for you to get your car
financing

02:00:44.689 --> 02:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
financing
 
02:00:47.089 --> 02:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
but otherwise they are absolutely under
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act is this a
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
question or are we having a debate eyes
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
called would you believe okay no I
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't believe
 
02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.209 align:start position:0%
wouldn't believe
okay

02:00:56.209 --> 02:00:56.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
so I suppose as somebody who's worked
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office in
 
02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and also in the
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Securities regulation doing
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
Securities enforcement
 
02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there are
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
different statutes for different
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
Industries and that the state's
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
Securities regulation statute allows for
 
02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:20.820 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Securities regulation
 
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:23.219 align:start position:0%
under the security statute
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
to go to the Attorney General's office
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
under the security statute to seek for
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
prosecution under the state's security
 
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
statute and that the carve out under the
 
02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:36.890 align:start position:0%
statute and that the carve out under the
states

02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:01:40.129 --> 02:01:40.139 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act is not such that
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
it allows people to get away with
 
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
Securities fraud it simply means that we
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
prosecute those who get away who commit
 
02:01:51.169 --> 02:01:51.179 align:start position:0%
Securities fraud are prosecuted under a
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
different code it is not that we allow
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
for Securities fraud to happen in the
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
state it's that you are prosecuted
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
simply under a different part of the
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
state's statute that having investigated
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
Securities fraud in the state I have
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
seen this part of the statute that it
 
02:02:09.290 --> 02:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
occurs under similarly auto dealers in
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
this state are not allowed to engage in
 
02:02:12.649 --> 02:02:12.659 align:start position:0%
fraud that auto dealers in the state
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
engage in two types of behavior one they
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
could sell you a lemon in which case
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
they are prosecuted under the state's
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act two they engage
 
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
in financing and if they give you dodgy
 
02:02:27.169 --> 02:02:27.179 align:start position:0%
financing instrument then they need to
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted under a separate part of
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
the state's statute so we don't allow
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
people in the state to Simply run
 
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
rampant we have different parts of our
 
02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:38.699 align:start position:0%
code that address different types of
 
02:02:41.209 --> 02:02:41.219 align:start position:0%
behavior and the consumer protection act
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
largely addresses when people engage
 
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
into various conduct largely related to
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
the sale of products
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with the consumer
 
02:02:53.050 --> 02:02:53.060 align:start position:0%
protection act that you do address here
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
is related to the inability of consumers
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
to address nefarious conduct with
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
regards to security is the insurance
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
industry banking instruments because
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
consumers are unable to bring actions
 
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
with regards to for example Securities
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
products if my Securities broker does me
 
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
wrong I can't bring a private right of
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
action which arguably is something that
 
02:03:19.729 --> 02:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed which we perhaps
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
could address it's been brought up a
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
number of times in the state and there
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
are pros and cons to that I guess this
 
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
is a would you believe everything that
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
I've just said but and I would believe
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
you said it excellently too but that's
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
where we're at right now and perhaps we
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
should be focusing on the private right
 
02:03:39.649 --> 02:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
of action elements rather than redoing
 
02:03:41.209 --> 02:03:41.219 align:start position:0%
the entire State's consumer protection
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
act which is a
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
which would be wildly difficult
 
02:03:47.209 --> 02:03:47.219 align:start position:0%
would you believe well yeah I would
 
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
believe all of that and uh obviously
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
what what we can agree on is that
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with consumer
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
protection act whether it's uh whether
 
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking about private citizens
 
02:03:57.050 --> 02:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
and their right of action or are you
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the state I mean uh yeah
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
the state has as tools as it's at its
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
disposal and private citizens do not
 
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
under the consumer protection act uh and
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be looked
 
02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
at that that's what this original Bill
 
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
intended to address
 
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
um so I've been kind of whipsawed back
 
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
and forth between people who say the
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
state has has the right to enforce uh
 
02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection and and those
 
02:04:22.129 --> 02:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
who are saying that that the state has
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
other tools so
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't know where the truth lies
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
probably in between but I do I do I
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
would believe what you just said
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:32.689 --> 02:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that was an
 
02:04:35.209 --> 02:04:35.219 align:start position:0%

02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and but this is an early
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
Bill all these bills we're doing today
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
are early bills so they we have to take
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
action very quickly so if you really do
 
02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:47.880 align:start position:0%

02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
we should take up you want to get it to
 
02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:50.229 align:start position:0%
we should take up you want to get it to

given the comments about a possible
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I just want to be really clear
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
on the opposition from the Attorney
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
General's office is to the bill as it
 
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:53.689 align:start position:0%
General's office is to the bill as it
was

02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:57.179 align:start position:0%
filed for certain reasons and you know I
 
02:05:58.370 --> 02:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
will speak to what those reasons are
 
02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'll also speak to what the Attorney
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
General's position would be uh if this
 
02:06:05.930 --> 02:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
bill were amended as was just discussed
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
um so but first you just you know I I
 
02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
did an orientation for this committee a
 
02:06:11.570 --> 02:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
number of weeks ago I know some of you
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
are new to the consumer protection World
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
um to speak a little bit about currently
 
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
how this exemption interplays with the
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
work that the Attorney General's office
 
02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:22.250 align:start position:0%
work that the Attorney General's office
does

02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
we are the primary recipient of consumer
 
02:06:27.770 --> 02:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
complaints in the state
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and we receive complaints daily
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
um across all Industries in the state
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
but some of the most frequent sources of
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
complaints as in fact I would be willing
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
to say the most frequent source of
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
complaints is against car dealers
 
02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
another extremely frequent source of
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
complaints that we receive
 
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
um are against insurance companies and
 
02:06:52.609 --> 02:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
we do often receive complaints against
 
02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:54.659 align:start position:0%
Banks although I'm not sure that I would
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
characterize the complaints that we
 
02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
receive as being complaints about unfair
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
interceptive Acts or practices so to
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
speak but we do receive a number of
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
complaints against Banks as it currently
 
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
sits the exemption to the consumer
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
protection act takes unfair and
 
02:07:12.290 --> 02:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
deceptive acts of practices that are
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
committed by those who are regulated by
 
02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
the banking commission the insurance
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
department the Bureau of Securities
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
regulation or the Public Utilities
 
02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.589 align:start position:0%
regulation or the Public Utilities
Commission

02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:07:23.689 --> 02:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
outside of the confines of the consumer
 
02:07:24.890 --> 02:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
02:07:27.109 --> 02:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
so the rights and remedies that the
 
02:07:29.450 --> 02:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office has to respond
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
to consumer complaints
 
02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
to go to court to get an injunction to
 
02:07:37.729 --> 02:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
seek restitution to charge a crime to
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
see jail time if appropriate
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
all of that conduct is currently
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
Exempted from 358a which is New
 
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consumer protection act so
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of complaints
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
that we receive that are regulated by
 
02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
those various state agencies are not
 
02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
looked at by the Attorney General's
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
office but are instead referred to the
 
02:07:58.250 --> 02:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
banking Department the insurance
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner or the Bureau of Securities
 
02:08:00.599 --> 02:08:03.129 align:start position:0%
commissioner or the Bureau of Securities
regulation

02:08:03.129 --> 02:08:03.139 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
02:08:06.649 --> 02:08:06.659 align:start position:0%
the this limitation
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
um poses real problems for the Attorney
 
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
General's office which I will talk about
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
shortly and has frequently and continues
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
to impede our ability to effectively
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
investigate and prosecute unfair and
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices within the
 
02:08:18.599 --> 02:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices within the
state

02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
um but the purpose so I I want to speak
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the purpose of this bill and where
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
the objection is to the bill as it's
 
02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
currently worded because the Attorney
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
General's office does not object in any
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
way shape or form to legislation that
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
would allow private rights of action to
 
02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
be free from the exemption in fact I
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
think that makes a lot of sense
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
currently the exemption was designed to
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
02:08:44.639 --> 02:08:45.350 align:start position:0%
apply to
um

02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
State not having you know dual
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement by you know multiple state
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
agencies but in doing so it took a tool
 
02:08:55.129 --> 02:08:55.139 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of you know private
 
02:08:56.930 --> 02:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
actors in this state who you know might
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
use the provisions of the consumer
 
02:09:00.410 --> 02:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
protection act to try to you know get
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
Justice for a grievance that was
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
suffered against them this is this
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
private right of action option under the
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act is critical
 
02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
because the Attorney General's office is
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
only able to take cases where the most
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
serious cases of unfair and deceptive
 
02:09:16.490 --> 02:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
Acts or practices where you have
 
02:09:18.169 --> 02:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
widespread consumer harm or you have
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
significant consumer harm we rely
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
heavily on the people of New Hampshire
 
02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
in smaller cases the cases that we can't
 
02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:26.330 align:start position:0%
in smaller cases the cases that we can't
take

02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:09:28.729 --> 02:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
to use the tools that have been given to
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
them under the consumer protection act
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
to enforce their that statute on their
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
own you know if it's a simple issue that
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
they can litigate themselves we support
 
02:09:39.649 --> 02:09:39.659 align:start position:0%
that and we strongly support them being
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
able to do that so the purpose of this
 
02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:43.430 align:start position:0%
able to do that so the purpose of this
bill

02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:09:45.169 --> 02:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
I think the Attorney General's office
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be in support of however there's
 
02:09:50.750 --> 02:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
significant concerning language
 
02:09:52.570 --> 02:09:52.580 align:start position:0%
regarding the Attorney General's
 
02:09:55.609 --> 02:09:55.619 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and frankly I won't
 
02:09:57.410 --> 02:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
speak for the other state agencies but
 
02:09:59.209 --> 02:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities that other state
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
agencies would inherit if this bill were
 
02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
to be passed in its current language
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
which is that when a consumer alleges a
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
violation of 358 A2 by an agency or
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
entity identified in the section the
 
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate government agency as
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
determined by the Attorney General May
 
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
issue a right to sue letter to the harm
 
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
consumer if the complaint is in question
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
is deemed to have Merit by the
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate agency
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
this is simply not realistic or
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
enforceable in any real way the number
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
of complaints that are made for
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
violations of 358 A2 are astronomical uh
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
both and this would as I read it cover
 
02:10:40.729 --> 02:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
both complaints that are made in the
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
form of a formal complaint to the
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and also you
 
02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:45.830 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and also you
know

02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
private rights of action that are
 
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
currently being brought the Attorney
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
General's office would be required to
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
determine for every single complaint
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
that was filed who the appropriate state
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
agency would be in order to for that
 
02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
state agency to then review the
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
complaint to determine whether on its
 
02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:02.030 align:start position:0%
complaint to determine whether on its
Merit

02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
Merit
 
02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
that case Justified a right to sue
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
letter that would need to be generated
 
02:11:09.169 --> 02:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
and sent to the consumer the resources
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
that it would take to to do this would
 
02:11:13.729 --> 02:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
be astronomical and I think that this
 
02:11:16.010 --> 02:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
lacks sufficient Clarity to really give
 
02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
these Attorney General's office or the
 
02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
state agencies that we are tasked with
 
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
determining as the appropriate state
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
agencies to really have an understanding
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
of what they would be required to do
 
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
Under the statute because looking at
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
every single complaint to determine if
 
02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
it has Merit Merit is an extremely uh
 
02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
general term it's
 
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
often not something that you can
 
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
determine just by looking at the face of
 
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
a complaint in order to determine
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
whether something has Merit that usually
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
requires an investigation it usually
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
requires interviews it requires
 
02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
subpoenas the review of documents you
 
02:11:52.970 --> 02:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
know some sort of diligence in order to
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
determine you know whether what the
 
02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
consumer is saying is true or not in
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
order to make a merits-based
 
02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:01.139 align:start position:0%
determination of a complaint
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
and to expect that the Attorney
 
02:12:05.089 --> 02:12:05.099 align:start position:0%
General's office and the other state
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
agencies involved here are going to be
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
able to realistically do that sort of
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
analysis is simply unrealistic
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
so that's why the Attorney General's
 
02:12:17.089 --> 02:12:17.099 align:start position:0%
office is opposing the bill as it's
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
currently worded
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
um but I I do think that it's my
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility as chief of the consumer
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
protection act to to note that you know
 
02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:26.510 align:start position:0%
protection act to to note that you know
this

02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
consequence of the exemption
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
um is just one of the many consequences
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
that the state faces as a result of this
 
02:12:37.729 --> 02:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
exemption uh private rights of action by
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
citizens are being precluded by this
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
exemption and it's a real problem uh
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
similarly the Attorney General's ability
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
to meaningfully investigate consumer
 
02:12:47.209 --> 02:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
protection act violations is being
 
02:12:49.729 --> 02:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
impeded by this exemption and my office
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
has over the years on a number of
 
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
occasions spoken out against this
 
02:12:56.569 --> 02:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
exemption in its entirety
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
um the other agencies that are involved
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
it's correct that they do have tools at
 
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
their disposal
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
to get restitution
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
um they do not have the same abilities
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General's office has
 
02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
to go to court to file for a meaningful
 
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
injunction in Superior Court to bring
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
criminal charges when appropriate and to
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
secure widespread protection for New
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consumers in those cases
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what the way it works is the
 
02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
agencies that are the primary Regulators
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
are responsible for doing the initial
 
02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
review and if they determine the unfair
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
and deceptive Acts or practices have
 
02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
occurred and the Attorney General's
 
02:13:35.689 --> 02:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
office should get involved and should go
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
to Superior Court to bring in action
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
they can refer it back to the Attorney
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
General's office for prosecution but the
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
reality is is that that is not happening
 
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
and we see regularly people coming in
 
02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:49.619 align:start position:0%
filing complaints against insurance
 
02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
companies mostly against car dealerships
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
and you know retail installment sales
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
contracts which are regulated by the
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
banking industry
 
02:13:59.689 --> 02:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
they file complaints with us and we tell
 
02:14:01.129 --> 02:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
them that we've referred their complaint
 
02:14:04.490 --> 02:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate agency and they say
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
well the we spoke with the agency and
 
02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
they're not taking any action and we
 
02:14:08.689 --> 02:14:08.699 align:start position:0%
have to tell them that our hands are
 
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
tied we have no further ability to do
 
02:14:13.609 --> 02:14:13.619 align:start position:0%
this unless this agency looks at it and
 
02:14:15.290 --> 02:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
refers it back to us and we're simply
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing those referrals
 
02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
it certainly makes sense to make sure
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't have redundant enforcement
 
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
of consumer protection laws but the
 
02:14:27.290 --> 02:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
State's Attorney General's office should
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
be the primary enforcer of consumer
 
02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
protection actions in the state in order
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that New Hampshire's
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
consumers are adequately protected
 
02:14:38.089 --> 02:14:38.099 align:start position:0%
um and if there were an amendment that
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
repealed this or amended it to make it
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
more consistent with other states so the
 
02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
only thing that is exempt from the
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act are those the
 
02:14:49.930 --> 02:14:49.940 align:start position:0%
conducts that are specifically
 
02:14:52.729 --> 02:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
authorized by the banking regulations or
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
by the insurance regulations so you you
 
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know we're not
 
02:14:58.850 --> 02:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting someone for something that
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
is otherwise authorized in New Hampshire
 
02:15:02.209 --> 02:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
law that's how most consumer protection
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
act exemptions in other states operate
 
02:15:07.129 --> 02:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
to preclude the Attorney General's
 
02:15:09.169 --> 02:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
office from being able to independently
 
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
bring consumer protection actions in
 
02:15:14.089 --> 02:15:14.099 align:start position:0%
cases especially cases against car
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
dealerships who are regulated by the
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
banking when it comes to their retail
 
02:15:20.330 --> 02:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
installment sale contracts there's a
 
02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
massive amount of Consumer Fraud that is
 
02:15:24.669 --> 02:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
going on in the state as it pertains to
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
retail installment sales contracts by
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
car dealerships and we feel that this
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
exemption has and continues to impede
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
our ability to effectively enforce our
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
laws and to protect consumers in the
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
state so if there were an amendment to
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
repeal the exemption in totality I think
 
02:15:40.729 --> 02:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office would
 
02:15:43.129 --> 02:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
support it and would certainly support
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill that creates a
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
private right of action or and protects
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
the private right of action for all New
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers but doesn't allocate
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
this responsibility to the Attorney
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
General's office to review complaints
 
02:15:59.390 --> 02:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
make merits determinations and issue
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
right to sue letters
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
how do you take any questions so that
 
02:16:05.089 --> 02:16:05.099 align:start position:0%
that's on the assumption that the
 
02:16:07.129 --> 02:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
in this case the banking department has
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
waived off on on following up the
 
02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
complaint that you're saying that we
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
should then empower the individual to
 
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
have right a pride of action because the
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
banking department has refused to assert
 
02:16:21.649 --> 02:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
consumer protection that's not what I'm
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
saying at all I I don't think there
 
02:16:25.250 --> 02:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
should be any limitation on a private
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
citizen from enforcing the consumer
 
02:16:29.450 --> 02:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
protection act regardless of who the
 
02:16:32.509 --> 02:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
state regulator is you know the consumer
 
02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
protection act anticipates joint
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement by the Department of Justice
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire citizens right as it
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
pertains to non-exempt conduct but
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's enforcement of 358a and all the
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
rights and remedies that are in 358a it
 
02:16:49.009 --> 02:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to take away that
 
02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:51.059 align:start position:0%
right for private citizens simply
 
02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
because the conduct at issue that
 
02:16:54.169 --> 02:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
resulted in the consumer harm is
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
regulated by the Bureau of Securities
 
02:16:58.370 --> 02:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
regulation or is regulated by the
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
banking commission or the insurance
 
02:17:01.849 --> 02:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
department the insurance department and
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
the banking Commission on The Regulators
 
02:17:06.410 --> 02:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
should be able to take any action that
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
is within their wheel has to take and
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
that they deem appropriate but I don't
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
see any reason that it makes sense to
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
limit a private Citizen's ability to go
 
02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
to court and seek Justice on their own
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
because if the if the banking commission
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
or I I don't want to throw any one
 
02:17:21.650 --> 02:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
agency under the bus or suggest that you
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
know there's a problem but
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
citizens should be able to quickly seek
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
Justice on their own regardless of
 
02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
whether a state agency is going to
 
02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
choose to pursue action based on
 
02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
violation of their statutes there's no
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
reason to take this out of the hands of
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
private citizens in any case regardless
 
02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
of whether there is joint action
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
um by another regulator for the statutes
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
that they enforce this provision of 358a
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
the private right of action should apply
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
to all citizens in New Hampshire
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
regardless of who the conduct was
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
committed by that led to their financial
 
02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
committed by that led to their financial
loss

02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
loss
 
02:17:59.690 --> 02:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
all right representative Philip
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
02:18:01.559 --> 02:18:02.629 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:18:04.669 --> 02:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
it already is the case that the Attorney
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
General's office has to reject cases
 
02:18:08.209 --> 02:18:08.219 align:start position:0%
that is sent to it from the outside
 
02:18:09.650 --> 02:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
agencies such as the Bureau of
 
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
Securities regulation because the
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is already
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
overworked and short staff is that
 
02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.150 align:start position:0%
overworked and short staff is that
correct

02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
so we cert is certainly correct to say
 
02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
that we do not accept every case that is
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
sent to us but if we receive referrals
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
of unfair and deceptive Acts or
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
practices from our agencies in the state
 
02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
from our you know brother and sister
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state we look at it very
 
02:18:37.730 --> 02:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
closely and if appropriate we bring we
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
regularly bring actions that are
 
02:18:41.089 --> 02:18:41.099 align:start position:0%
referred to us by the Bureau of
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
Securities regulations I'm not sure if
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
anybody's here today that is going to
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
testify but we've routinely receive
 
02:18:48.290 --> 02:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
referrals and we have brought
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
significant criminal cases against
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
violators of the security statutes I I
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
have our unit has three trials scheduled
 
02:18:58.310 --> 02:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
this year for felony counts of
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
Securities fraud that were referrals
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
from the Bureau of Securities
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
regulations to our office and in those
 
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
cases the situation worked great but
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
it's the cases that we're not seen where
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
the referral is not being made where we
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't even know it's happening and this
 
02:19:14.330 --> 02:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
the lack of the ability on the front end
 
02:19:16.009 --> 02:19:16.019 align:start position:0%
for the Attorney General's office to
 
02:19:17.929 --> 02:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
look at these cases and inhibits our
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure the consumers are
 
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
being adequately protected for the
 
02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:22.669 align:start position:0%
being adequately protected for the
question

02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
were the Attorney General's office
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
though to receive this authority to
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
review the cases at the first instance
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
that would require a substantial more
 
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
staff for the Attorney General's office
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it is correct you
 
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
know we receive consumer complaints
 
02:19:41.290 --> 02:19:41.300 align:start position:0%
against these entities regularly already
 
02:19:45.889 --> 02:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
and we send them to the appropriate
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
agency if they're regulated by that
 
02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:49.969 align:start position:0%
agency if they're regulated by that
agency

02:19:49.969 --> 02:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
could we with the staff that we
 
02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
02:19:55.969 --> 02:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
continue our initial screening process
 
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
and send those complaints to the
 
02:20:00.290 --> 02:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
respective businesses and do a merits
 
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
assessment that would allow us to
 
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
determine you know whether significant
 
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
violations are potentially occurring
 
02:20:07.849 --> 02:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
here and bring action on our current
 
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
staff I think that we could do that we
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
would have to shift our enforcement
 
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
priorities certainly you know because we
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
can't do everything but currently the
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is not doing
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
any significant work in the area of
 
02:20:21.290 --> 02:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
unfair and deceptive Acts or practices
 
02:20:22.969 --> 02:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
committed by insurance companies or
 
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
committed by entities regulated by the
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
banking industry I mean with the
 
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
exception of one case that was done
 
02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
earlier this year against a car
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
dealership here in Concord we don't have
 
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
any unfair and deceptive Acts or
 
02:20:36.349 --> 02:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
practices by insurance companies or by
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
anyone regulated by the banking industry
 
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
that we're currently working on those
 
02:20:44.110 --> 02:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:46.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Terry thank you
 
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
um with respect to your uh your
 
02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:54.230 align:start position:0%
um with respect to your uh your
testimony

02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
um with reference to uh colleagues in
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:21:01.849 --> 02:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
um and and other state laws it is
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
effectively would you characterize New
 
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as kind of an outlier with
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
respect to the issues that you have have
 
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
raised in terms of the uh the exemption
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
and the private cause of action
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
particularly so other states have
 
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
exemptions so I don't want to create the
 
02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
the impression that an exemption at all
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
is something where New Hampshire is an
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
outlier but the exemptions tend to focus
 
02:21:27.130 --> 02:21:27.140 align:start position:0%
on exempting conduct that is otherwise
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
authorized in the state so for example
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
if you know we got a complaint car
 
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
dealership is doing something in the
 
02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
course of a consumer applying for
 
02:21:38.929 --> 02:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
financing to to purchase a vehicle that
 
02:21:40.610 --> 02:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
the consumer says we think this is an
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive Act of practice the
 
02:21:43.610 --> 02:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office should charge
 
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
this person with a crime
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
if that conduct
 
02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
um is something that you know we thought
 
02:21:52.969 --> 02:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
this is a huge problem but is authorized
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
by the banking regulations or the
 
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
banking laws then absolutely you don't
 
02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
want us Prosecuting somebody for
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
something that is otherwise authorized
 
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's law that exemption
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense I think we are an
 
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
outlier in the sense that our exemption
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
is not narrowly tailored like that but
 
02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
rather it simply exempts any conduct by
 
02:22:16.130 --> 02:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
any business that is regulated
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and has the ability to regulate
 
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive Acts or practices we
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
can't look at it at all regardless of
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
what the conduct is unless it's
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized and referred to
 
02:22:29.330 --> 02:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
us by that agency
 
02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
well for the question so in your view
 
02:22:35.330 --> 02:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
then uh would would you say in summary
 
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
that that weakens consumer protections I
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
think it absolutely weakens the Attorney
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
General's office's ability to protect
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
consumers in the state thank you
 
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
representative kips
 
02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:50.809 --> 02:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
do you see it as possible that this bill
 
02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
could be amended so as to allow private
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
citizen rights of action and provide
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
more appropriate enforcement authority
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
to your office without placing
 
02:23:06.250 --> 02:23:06.260 align:start position:0%
um inappropriate and unnecessary burdens
 
02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh on either uh the State Department of
 
02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
Justice or the other enforcement
 
02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:13.670 align:start position:0%
Justice or the other enforcement
agencies

02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
I do
 
02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and you know there was a comment that
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
was made that it would be wildly
 
02:23:18.479 --> 02:23:19.849 align:start position:0%
was made that it would be wildly
difficult

02:23:19.849 --> 02:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:23:21.530 --> 02:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
um to make these amendments and and I
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with that comment
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
I I think that all that would need to be
 
02:23:28.429 --> 02:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
done is the exemption if if the
 
02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
exemption is simply repealed it would it
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
would address the entire problem but if
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
to the extent we want to keep an
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
exemption in place for authorized
 
02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
conduct you'd simply make it so that
 
02:23:41.690 --> 02:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
only authorized conduct is exempt as it
 
02:23:43.330 --> 02:23:43.340 align:start position:0%
applies to the Attorney General's office
 
02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
and specifically include language that
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
private citizens are not subject to this
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
exemption either that would address the
 
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
entire issue for both the Attorney
 
02:23:54.770 --> 02:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
General's perspective and I believe from
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
private citizens perspective who were
 
02:23:58.490 --> 02:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
the target of this bill in the first
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
place thank you I think it would be some
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
great so we'll look forward to seeing an
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment from you when we take it up in
 
02:24:05.929 --> 02:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which will be next
 
02:24:05.939 --> 02:24:07.309 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which will be next
Wednesday

02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:16.130 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
so uh I guess we'll take a little uh
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
detour here uh Heather silver scene from
 
02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
The New Hampshire insurance department
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:35.929 --> 02:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning um Heather
 
02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
Silverstein I'm general counsel for the
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department
 
02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and I guess
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
but we are in opposition for a variety
 
02:24:46.090 --> 02:24:46.100 align:start position:0%
of reasons I'm speaking for insurance
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
and so not other agencies
 
02:24:52.849 --> 02:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
um we insurance is a highly regulated
 
02:24:56.270 --> 02:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
industry we had 750 complaints last year
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
we recovered for over four million
 
02:25:00.889 --> 02:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
dollars for consumers last year our
 
02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
consumer protection is even our consumer
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
division is even by Statute it's RSA
 
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
400a 15-e we have a consumer division uh
 
02:25:13.490 --> 02:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
with seven employees when we review
 
02:25:17.690 --> 02:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints there can be as many
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
as a few attorneys in the room the
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are awful often in the
 
02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
room and we do legal reviews and
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
directors at our agency are also in the
 
02:25:28.849 --> 02:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
room when we are reviewing consumer
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
complaints so we take it very seriously
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
for us the concern is like a muddying of
 
02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
the waters because of we have regulatory
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
control over insurance issues including
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
unfair Trade Practices
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
and so that would be something that we
 
02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:46.010 align:start position:0%
and so that would be something that we
regulate

02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
um complaints related to anything
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory for insurance including that
 
02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:54.740 align:start position:0%
the other issue is um
 
02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
internally I described our process and
 
02:25:58.849 --> 02:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
then externally
 
02:26:01.450 --> 02:26:01.460 align:start position:0%
um Mr garage touched on it a little bit
 
02:26:04.130 --> 02:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
we also talked to Banking and securities
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the AG's office we meet four times a
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
year and this was is because of RSA 21u
 
02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
which came about because of the 2002
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
issue that happened way back when with
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
um a bad player will say frm yes thank
 
02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:22.670 align:start position:0%
um a bad player will say frm yes thank
you

02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
um and so uh we meet quarterly and I
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
also every month review complaints that
 
02:26:33.170 --> 02:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
um Mr Gerard sends over to our office in
 
02:26:35.450 --> 02:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
case they miss them so they they refer
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
they refer cases to our office if they
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
notice that it it goes to our office but
 
02:26:41.450 --> 02:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
then there's other things that wouldn't
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the attorney generals wouldn't
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily know goes to our office that
 
02:26:47.690 --> 02:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
I could pick up that is like you know
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
maybe a warranty issue a 415c issue or
 
02:26:51.770 --> 02:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
portable Electronics a certain
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
complaints that they wouldn't at the top
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
of their head go oh that goes to
 
02:26:56.929 --> 02:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
Insurance because they're licensees that
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
they are not as familiar with and and
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
um you know that's important as the
 
02:27:04.570 --> 02:27:04.580 align:start position:0%
expertise is with us as the regulator
 
02:27:08.270 --> 02:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
because we are very involved with our
 
02:27:10.250 --> 02:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
licensees we do examinations of our
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
licensees we do investigations with our
 
02:27:14.510 --> 02:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
licensees and
 
02:27:17.450 --> 02:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
um it's important for that consistency
 
02:27:20.690 --> 02:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
with our with our licensees that we
 
02:27:23.650 --> 02:27:23.660 align:start position:0%
maintain that regulatory
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
control if you will one of the concerns
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
that I have with the bill is written I
 
02:27:30.889 --> 02:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
notice it extends the statute of
 
02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
limitations and also increases damages
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
to two to three times the damages if
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
anything were to fall under the consumer
 
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
protection act and as you know
 
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
anticipated even anticipated costs of
 
02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
anticipated even anticipated costs of
insurance

02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
um companies that gets passed on to
 
02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
Consumers that means higher premiums for
 
02:27:52.849 --> 02:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
all of us even if it doesn't happen like
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
even if there weren't more court cases I
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
guess my last issue is when we have
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
consumers that come to our door
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we can help them and there's
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
other times that we can't help them and
 
02:28:07.010 --> 02:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
they can still go to court they can have
 
02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
this coverage cases which does allow for
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees if you file a coverage
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
case in in Superior Court if you're
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
having a you know dispute with your own
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
insurance company or tort cases like
 
02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
tour cases are followed all the time so
 
02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just because you went to our
 
02:28:23.690 --> 02:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
agency for Relief and maybe we if we
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't provide relief because there
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't a regulatory violation
 
02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't preclude you from going
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
to court if there is an actual legal
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
issue to go to court with um one of our
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
licensees so
 
02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:38.030 align:start position:0%
licensees so
great

02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Terry Mr chair uh uh to
 
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh which subcommittee are you going to
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
assign this bill
 
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is uh Insurance
 
02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:49.690 align:start position:0%
this is uh Insurance
um

02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.130 --> 02:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what I signed this one
 
02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:53.530 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what I signed this one
too

02:28:53.530 --> 02:28:53.540 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:28:57.770 --> 02:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh it I I believe my question I I
 
02:29:00.410 --> 02:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
believe I assigned this to the Banking
 
02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
Committee because it's consumer you know
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
well then I will ask my questions if
 
02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
it's not going to my subcommittee okay
 
02:29:07.490 --> 02:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
so with respect to your uh your your
 
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
observing that um that costs would
 
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
increase uh under the provisions of of
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
this uh bill
 
02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh is it not is it not true though that
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the increases that are requested
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
in premiums by insurance companies are
 
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
regulated by overseeing and regulated by
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
the insurance department such that if
 
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
you anticipate costs that don't actually
 
02:29:38.270 --> 02:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
happen that there would not be some sort
 
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
of adjustment down the road to your
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
premiums yes there could be an
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
adjustment but they are allowed it could
 
02:29:47.290 --> 02:29:47.300 align:start position:0%
be or would no they are allowed to
 
02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
prospectively they are allowed to
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
increase premise on anticipation but in
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
fact if those costs don't materialize
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
then there would be an adjustment to
 
02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
take into consideration that they were
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
not happening later
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:30:04.610 --> 02:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative magular uh thank you um a
 
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
quick question if if this were to be
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
amended as uh Mr Gerard said would the
 
02:30:13.010 --> 02:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh be more inclined
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
to to uh
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
I answered my question we like
 
02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:20.510 align:start position:0%
I answered my question we like
consistency

02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
02:30:22.969 --> 02:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
or is you
 
02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
regulated Statewide but we are also
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
collaborate with other states through
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
the National Association of insurance
 
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and
 
02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
um our collaboration you know the end we
 
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
have a model law for the unfair trade
 
02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
practice that is pretty consistent with
 
02:30:39.889 --> 02:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
other states
 
02:30:43.610 --> 02:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and this is not as consistent with
 
02:30:46.429 --> 02:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
other states I would say
 
02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
and there is a fair amount of opposition
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
from insurance providers
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you okay
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
so we don't have the banking department
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
so we'll have Christian Merrell from the
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
bankers Association
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.130 --> 02:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:18.060 align:start position:0%

02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
today I'm Christy Merrill I'm president
 
02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Bankers Association
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
and with me is Rob diele Rob is
 
02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:31.260 align:start position:0%

garchow law firm and he's legal counsel
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
to the association New Hampshire Bankers
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
represents 38 members and just about 6
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
000 employees I'm here today to oppose
 
02:31:44.750 --> 02:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 459 as it's been
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
introduced and I can I'll get into our
 
02:31:49.849 --> 02:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
opposition a little bit but just briefly
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
regarding the amendment that has been
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
proposed we would be in opposition to
 
02:31:55.250 --> 02:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
that as well so I just wanted to be
 
02:31:57.770 --> 02:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
clear about that as you all know this
 
02:31:59.870 --> 02:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislation amends the New Hampshire
 
02:32:02.090 --> 02:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act by eliminating
 
02:32:03.889 --> 02:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
the exemptions for banks which has been
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
in place for decades and it also adds a
 
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
private right of action for consumers I
 
02:32:12.410 --> 02:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
want to be really clear that while banks
 
02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
are exempt from the consumer protection
 
02:32:16.610 --> 02:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
act it does not mean that they are are
 
02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
not subjected to these types of laws I
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
know that that's been brought up a
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
little bit but in New Hampshire statute
 
02:32:27.170 --> 02:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
that is found under 383a those are the
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
banking statutes and that's where the
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
authority rests with the banking
 
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner to to address banks that
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
may have violated the consumer
 
02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
protection act so I wanted to make that
 
02:32:40.750 --> 02:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
point and additionally as you all know
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
banks are very heavily regulated and
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
Banks typically have a state federal
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
regulator through the New Hampshire
 
02:32:50.090 --> 02:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
banking department and they all have at
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
least one Federal regulator and they are
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
examined every 18 months they now that
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
covet is over they will come into their
 
02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
offices and be there for quite a bit of
 
02:33:01.370 --> 02:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
time and they will one of the things
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
that they look at is consumer protection
 
02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
so specifically I just want to talk
 
02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
about some of those federal regulations
 
02:33:10.610 --> 02:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
that Banks may be subject to the the
 
02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
Federal Department of Insurance
 
02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:13.190 align:start position:0%
Federal Department of Insurance
Corporation

02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
Corporation
 
02:33:15.650 --> 02:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve Bank the office of
 
02:33:17.570 --> 02:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
the Comptroller of currency the federal
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
financial institutions examination
 
02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
Council the financial crimes enforcement
 
02:33:23.809 --> 02:33:23.819 align:start position:0%
Network and the Consumer Financial
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau they all have
 
02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:26.929 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau they all have
oversight

02:33:26.929 --> 02:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I did want to just point out and not
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
to get too much into the weeds
 
02:33:37.790 --> 02:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
but from the fdic's manual on consumer
 
02:33:41.210 --> 02:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
compliance examinations in their manuals
 
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
they specifically talk about compliance
 
02:33:45.889 --> 02:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
with consumer protection laws and so I'm
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
just going to read just a quick sentence
 
02:33:49.849 --> 02:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
here that I think is really relevant to
 
02:33:51.410 --> 02:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
your discussions
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
so from their compliance examination
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
manual consumer compliance examinations
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
are the primary means the FDIC uses to
 
02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
determine whether a financial
 
02:34:03.530 --> 02:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
institution is meeting its
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to comply with the
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and prescriptions of
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
federal consumer protection laws and
 
02:34:10.319 --> 02:34:11.929 align:start position:0%
federal consumer protection laws and
regulations

02:34:11.929 --> 02:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
so I think that's really relevant to the
 
02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:15.170 align:start position:0%
so I think that's really relevant to the
conversation

02:34:15.170 --> 02:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:15.770 align:start position:0%
conversation
um

02:34:15.770 --> 02:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation would add just another
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
level of multi-tiered overstride
 
02:34:22.250 --> 02:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
structure oversight structure and
 
02:34:23.809 --> 02:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
through the private right of action and
 
02:34:26.330 --> 02:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
classes of plaintiffs we just don't
 
02:34:28.610 --> 02:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
believe that this is necessary given the
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
range of options that exist today and no
 
02:34:32.450 --> 02:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
other business in New Hampshire is
 
02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
regulated or subject to the kind of
 
02:34:37.610 --> 02:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
oversight that applies to banking
 
02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and I you know I don't know if it's
 
02:34:42.170 --> 02:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
if there's a concern about the state's
 
02:34:44.270 --> 02:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
ability to enter into class action
 
02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
multi-state lawsuits there are several
 
02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
of those that are happening I can cite
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
them but I think you all are probably
 
02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
aware of that so in short we really just
 
02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
don't understand what this is trying to
 
02:34:59.030 --> 02:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
solve so we're happy to answer any
 
02:35:01.130 --> 02:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
questions but we would ask for an
 
02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and we do have
 
02:35:03.889 --> 02:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
legal counsel here that can try and
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
um okay now
 
02:35:19.370 --> 02:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
Flash from the past from the last time
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.290 --> 02:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
how long how many years has this been
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:39.230 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:56.690 align:start position:0%
excellent
yep

02:35:56.690 --> 02:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
turn that mic on and and hold it very
 
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
close to your face yeah it's got to be
 
02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:03.050 align:start position:0%
close to your face yeah it's got to be
red

02:36:03.050 --> 02:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
red
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:08.929 --> 02:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for this opportunity
 
02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
to speak I'm going to make I'm going to
 
02:36:12.889 --> 02:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
shorten up the remarks that I had
 
02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
planned because the attorney uh attorney
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
garage spoke so well I figured he really
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
outlined the reasons why we need to do
 
02:36:24.650 --> 02:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
something about the exemption
 
02:36:26.270 --> 02:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
so I was trying to think well what
 
02:36:28.010 --> 02:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
should I Salvage well you've got my
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony but what can I what
 
02:36:32.510 --> 02:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to you the most Salient
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
item yes okay so first for those of you
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
who I hadn't appeared before
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
um Peter Wright I've been practicing in
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for 40 years 20 years
 
02:36:46.969 --> 02:36:46.979 align:start position:0%
private practice and then I most
 
02:36:50.929 --> 02:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
recently worked in uh for UNH Law School
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
of Law as director of the clinics and I
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
ran a consumer and commercial law clinic
 
02:36:58.130 --> 02:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
where I would teach students how to
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
handle cases by representing real real
 
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
individuals families who were faced with
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
consumer protection problems and so
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
um we we got to see the whole range of
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
problems and
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
I was um
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
I had to make note uh chairman hunt of
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
one one comment you made about how the
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
purpose of the consumer protection act
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
and some of the banking statutes is to
 
02:37:30.889 --> 02:37:30.899 align:start position:0%
get restitution
 
02:37:33.050 --> 02:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
but see it's there's there's so much
 
02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
more than that often needed in a
 
02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
particular case let me give you just one
 
02:37:39.170 --> 02:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
quick example
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's a banking case not a New Hampshire
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
bank but our client was needed a ten
 
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar loan for to pay a
 
02:37:50.090 --> 02:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
property taxes and to make some
 
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
improvements to a property she went
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
online she's scanning through 17 pages
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
of fine print where you can't go back
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
to double check and she does e-signature
 
02:38:03.650 --> 02:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
and she got her loan which she didn't
 
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
know is she also had
 
02:38:08.090 --> 02:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
a mortgage on her property a second
 
02:38:10.010 --> 02:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
mortgage and she didn't really realize
 
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
that until she was facing foreclosure
 
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
now what was unfair about this loan
 
02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
the interest rate
 
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
was expressed as a daily rate as a
 
02:38:25.730 --> 02:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
percentage it was Point decimal point
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
three four two four six five seven five
 
02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:30.290 align:start position:0%
three four two four six five seven five
three

02:38:30.290 --> 02:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:38:32.210 --> 02:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
what does that mean I read that I
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
thought I was looking at pie you know
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
the the uh the the numerical and but no
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
in terms what you have to do is you take
 
02:38:41.950 --> 02:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
that number and you multiply it times
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
365 to get the annual rate now you and I
 
02:38:47.570 --> 02:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
can do that but this poor lady had no
 
02:38:50.690 --> 02:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
idea that her loan had a rate of 125
 
02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:52.010 align:start position:0%
idea that her loan had a rate of 125
percent

02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
and not only that they were pulling the
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
payments out on that loan daily
 
02:38:59.090 --> 02:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
automatically from a checking account
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
could we use the consumer protection act
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
to help her no because this was some
 
02:39:08.210 --> 02:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
out-of-state bank and as currently
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
worded that exemption
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just um it's not just based
 
02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
on the jurisdiction of banking
 
02:39:17.570 --> 02:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
Securities public utilities and
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
insurance here in New Hampshire it's
 
02:39:22.490 --> 02:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
other other federal or other regulatory
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
schemes that have the power to to
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
enforce and redress unfair Trade
 
02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:28.790 align:start position:0%
enforce and redress unfair Trade
Practices

02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
Practices
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
so that what does that mean well so it
 
02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
means you forget about the consumer
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
protection act you've got to stand in
 
02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
your head to try to find some other way
 
02:39:38.210 --> 02:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
and we did we came up with we managed to
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
squeeze this loan under the small loan
 
02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
act the 10th with the ten thousand
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
dollar limit
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
which says it forbids taking
 
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
um a security interest in real estate
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
therefore it was an illegal loan it was
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
a basically a felony and the illegal
 
02:39:55.610 --> 02:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
loans are void so we were able to get
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
her to save her house
 
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
anyway so that's an example though where
 
02:40:03.050 --> 02:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
the the need for Relief goes well beyond
 
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
restitution we needed uh an injunction
 
02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
to stop the foreclosure and we needed a
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
declaration that the loan was illegal so
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't so they would go away
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
and we did get that
 
02:40:17.809 --> 02:40:17.819 align:start position:0%
all right I thought I might speak very
 
02:40:20.690 --> 02:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
briefly about the mechanism of the
 
02:40:22.610 --> 02:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
private attorney general
 
02:40:25.969 --> 02:40:25.979 align:start position:0%
now that's a term of art that's used in
 
02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
consumer law to talk about the power of
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
the individual to bring a suit
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
the private right of action but not just
 
02:40:35.170 --> 02:40:35.180 align:start position:0%
to bring the suit but if they Prevail
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
they can have an award of attorneys fees
 
02:40:41.330 --> 02:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
ordered by the court so it's a way to
 
02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
fund individual litigation to enable
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
someone who otherwise couldn't possibly
 
02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:50.090 align:start position:0%
someone who otherwise couldn't possibly
um

02:40:50.090 --> 02:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
just go up against the war chest of some
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the moneyed interests that commit
 
02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
these unfair practices so you've got the
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
the beauty of the private attorney
 
02:41:00.410 --> 02:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
general is it doesn't cost the state
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
anything because the costs of doing
 
02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:05.230 align:start position:0%
anything because the costs of doing
investigation

02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
depositions of filing the suit it's all
 
02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
um yes the attorney may have to put some
 
02:41:13.849 --> 02:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
money up up front but ultimately if they
 
02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
Prevail because it's meritorious they
 
02:41:20.090 --> 02:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
can have an award of fees and costs to
 
02:41:21.530 --> 02:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
get paid back and that's the beauty of
 
02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:22.190 align:start position:0%
get paid back and that's the beauty of
it

02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
cost free to the state and yet these
 
02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
individual cases which can are amenable
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
to treatment on an on the private right
 
02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
of action
 
02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:34.370 align:start position:0%
of action
um

02:41:34.370 --> 02:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
they can't they're not going to be they
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
can't be pursued by banking I mean
 
02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:41.990 align:start position:0%
can't be pursued by banking I mean
banking

02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
banking
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
actually has um part of their form
 
02:41:46.309 --> 02:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
letter when they do take a complaint and
 
02:41:47.929 --> 02:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
they do prosecute it through their
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing it says we're not
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
representing you you may want to get
 
02:41:53.150 --> 02:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
your own attorney so if they have to get
 
02:41:55.309 --> 02:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
their own attorney anyway having the
 
02:41:57.230 --> 02:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism for fee shifting or getting
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
their attorney's fees paid if they win
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
is so critical
 
02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the other point that I'd like to
 
02:42:05.210 --> 02:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
make that we haven't heard anything
 
02:42:07.849 --> 02:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
about is you know this isn't all this
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
isn't just about consumers
 
02:42:12.290 --> 02:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
this is about business in New Hampshire
 
02:42:14.450 --> 02:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
and for those 20 years before I worked
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
at UNH I represented businesses you may
 
02:42:18.889 --> 02:42:18.899 align:start position:0%
not believe that I represent insurance
 
02:42:21.889 --> 02:42:21.899 align:start position:0%
companies and the point is this
 
02:42:21.899 --> 02:42:23.510 align:start position:0%
companies and the point is this
Marketplace

02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
 
02:42:25.550 --> 02:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
will you have a much better chance of
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
having a
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
um an absence of fraud an unfair Trade
 
02:42:33.050 --> 02:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
Practices if there is enforcement
 
02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
of these standards
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
and so that's one of the benefits of
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
conferring upon the individual the
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
private right of action is they can go
 
02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
after unfair trade practice and it
 
02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
benefits honest business honest business
 
02:42:48.830 --> 02:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
can compete better in a Level Playing
 
02:42:50.510 --> 02:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
Field where everybody's going by the
 
02:42:53.030 --> 02:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
rules but when you have competitors who
 
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
are engaging in false advertising or
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
cutting corners or doing other
 
02:43:00.530 --> 02:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous conduct
 
02:43:03.290 --> 02:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
that hurts honest business and we need
 
02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
to realize that this consumer protection
 
02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
act is to help business as well
 
02:43:11.330 --> 02:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
and I think I will let me just see if
 
02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's anything else well I would um
 
02:43:19.070 --> 02:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
endorse the idea of amending this bill
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
frankly to repeal
 
02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the the exemption as it stands now I
 
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
think it would go a long way toward
 
02:43:29.450 --> 02:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
restoring the private right of action
 
02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
and actually helping
 
02:43:34.490 --> 02:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Marketplace
 
02:43:37.130 --> 02:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
that's all I have okay
 
02:43:39.290 --> 02:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
represent Philip
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
Professor do you see any value to the
 
02:43:43.969 --> 02:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
right to sue letter from the Attorney
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
General's office with regards to the
 
02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:48.420 --> 02:43:49.730 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:43:49.730 --> 02:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:43:53.270 --> 02:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
originally I was trying to in in giving
 
02:43:55.250 --> 02:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
some input into this bill as it is
 
02:43:57.950 --> 02:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
before you today I was trying to strike
 
02:44:00.889 --> 02:44:00.899 align:start position:0%
a balance between I think there's been
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
expressed in the past a fear of
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
frivolous litigation and just burdening
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses with uh
 
02:44:11.450 --> 02:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
litigation that without Merit and I I
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't agree that that's a problem based
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
on this statute because if you think
 
02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
about what an attorney has to commit in
 
02:44:21.230 --> 02:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
order to win one of these cases the
 
02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
investigation and the research and going
 
02:44:25.490 --> 02:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
to court and all that you don't take
 
02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
frivolous cases I you just don't you you
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
learn to scope out good cases with Merit
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
and you learn to reject and and explain
 
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
to people why you don't have a case you
 
02:44:40.370 --> 02:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
just do and so that the idea of having
 
02:44:44.210 --> 02:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
the AG review really a complaint meaning
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
a legal pleading and maybe looking at
 
02:44:48.889 --> 02:44:48.899 align:start position:0%
some of the investigation behind it
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
before the individual could exercise
 
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
their private right was it was an
 
02:44:56.929 --> 02:44:56.939 align:start position:0%
attempt to strike a compromise and then
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
I I did speak with attorney garad about
 
02:45:02.090 --> 02:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
this before today and I realized that
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
they couldn't support that I I
 
02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
understand that and it's one of the
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
reasons in my conclusion I'm saying
 
02:45:11.690 --> 02:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
please just repeal this but my fallback
 
02:45:13.309 --> 02:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
position I don't want to take your time
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
because I I know we're short on the
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
clock but
 
02:45:19.370 --> 02:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question then about
 
02:45:22.490 --> 02:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
you know yes thank you okay
 
02:45:24.650 --> 02:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming it's great
 
02:45:26.450 --> 02:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
seeing you again you too thank you take
 
02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:27.290 align:start position:0%
seeing you again you too thank you take
care

02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:28.730 align:start position:0%
care
okay

02:45:28.730 --> 02:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:31.070 align:start position:0%
okay
um

02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
so uh we have some insurance companies
 
02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
who want to come up and and uh Express
 
02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
their concern so we'll start with Jim
 
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
Hayden from State Farm
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
and I will hope you'll be a model of
 
02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:47.690 align:start position:0%
and I will hope you'll be a model of
brevity

02:45:47.690 --> 02:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:45:51.770 --> 02:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
committee um Jim Hayden here on behalf
 
02:45:54.050 --> 02:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
of State Farm insurance companies
 
02:45:57.050 --> 02:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the nation's largest writer of
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance homeowners Auto life and I'm
 
02:46:02.570 --> 02:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
here in opposition and I will be very
 
02:46:05.690 --> 02:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
brief we've addressed this issue many
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
times in the past years and I've heard a
 
02:46:14.270 --> 02:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony that relates to how the
 
02:46:16.610 --> 02:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Law relates to the
 
02:46:19.309 --> 02:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
laws that regulate specific Industries
 
02:46:21.830 --> 02:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
such as insurance companies and you know
 
02:46:24.969 --> 02:46:24.979 align:start position:0%
the discussion about this bill really
 
02:46:27.889 --> 02:46:27.899 align:start position:0%
can focus on one area to really drive
 
02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
home how problematic it would be if New
 
02:46:33.650 --> 02:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire passed this bill whether it's
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the form presented or in the amended
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
form and that is relates to you know how
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
it would Impact Insurance companies uh
 
02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
costs and claims that they would need to
 
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
be paid in connection with accidents and
 
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
how this bill by itself
 
02:46:52.429 --> 02:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
would actually have an inflationary
 
02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
impact on those claims costs that would
 
02:46:56.690 --> 02:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
ultimately be passed along to New
 
02:46:59.270 --> 02:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers and the reason for
 
02:47:01.730 --> 02:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
that is it introduces a dynamic into the
 
02:47:04.730 --> 02:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
claims process that you really have to
 
02:47:07.849 --> 02:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
be mindful of as you consider this bill
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so if you look in the insurance
 
02:47:11.690 --> 02:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
statutes there's
 
02:47:14.030 --> 02:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
um you know there there is one statute
 
02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:16.090 align:start position:0%
um you know there there is one statute
of

02:47:16.090 --> 02:47:16.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
45417 I recall it deals with unfair
 
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
Trade Practices and in that there's a
 
02:47:26.809 --> 02:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
provision that governs a subparagraph
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
that governs unfair Claims Settlement
 
02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
practices by insurers and so with that
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
statute our insurance department
 
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
monitors and regulates the behavior of
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies as they manage
 
02:47:42.950 --> 02:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
claims in the day-to-day conduct and you
 
02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
know to the extent insurance companies
 
02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
need to be criticized or brought back
 
02:47:49.849 --> 02:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
into line I can assure you our insurance
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
department does that
 
02:47:55.130 --> 02:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
um but what that statute doesn't do very
 
02:47:57.170 --> 02:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
specifically is create a private cause
 
02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
of action which which the
 
02:48:04.849 --> 02:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act does have and
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
the reason is that if you introduce a
 
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
private cause of action into the claims
 
02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:11.870 align:start position:0%
private cause of action into the claims
process

02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
um you create you you create more
 
02:48:18.770 --> 02:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
litigation and more claims costs
 
02:48:20.750 --> 02:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and let me give you an example of how
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
02:48:24.170 --> 02:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
um let's say that your grandmother is
 
02:48:26.929 --> 02:48:26.939 align:start position:0%
involved with uh in an auto accident
 
02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
with a teenage driver
 
02:48:32.270 --> 02:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
um your grandmother bought her insurance
 
02:48:35.270 --> 02:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
and through that policy they're not only
 
02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
bought you know obligation for the
 
02:48:42.050 --> 02:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
insurance company to pay them or pay the
 
02:48:44.450 --> 02:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
teenage driver if the grandmother was
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
actually at at fault however it also
 
02:48:51.650 --> 02:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
provides an attorney and a defense so
 
02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
that the grandmother can protect herself
 
02:48:55.969 --> 02:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
from improper claims that it was her
 
02:48:58.849 --> 02:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
fault so when the insurance company is
 
02:49:01.849 --> 02:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
adjusting a claim it inevitably is a
 
02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
conflict between the claimant the
 
02:49:07.550 --> 02:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
teenage driver and the grandmother the
 
02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
insured this
 
02:49:13.849 --> 02:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
under current law there's no private
 
02:49:16.130 --> 02:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
cause of action by that teenager against
 
02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
the insurance company
 
02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
so by this by this uh by enactment of
 
02:49:26.110 --> 02:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
this law you would allow a the teenager
 
02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
to sue the insurance company not just
 
02:49:30.170 --> 02:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
the grandmother but the insurance
 
02:49:32.809 --> 02:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
company and make a claim that they're
 
02:49:35.950 --> 02:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
not settling this claim properly okay
 
02:49:40.130 --> 02:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
now that's problematic by itself but you
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
need to focus on the fact that the New
 
02:49:44.809 --> 02:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Consumer Protection Law
 
02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
provides for triple damages and
 
02:49:51.170 --> 02:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees so now you have first a
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
claim against the grandmother for
 
02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
causing the accident now you have a
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
separate claim that multiplies an
 
02:49:59.630 --> 02:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
additional claim that multiplies the
 
02:50:03.469 --> 02:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
potential damages by by times three plus
 
02:50:05.230 --> 02:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees
 
02:50:08.990 --> 02:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
and this is this is a dynamic that's
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
actually played out over time in other
 
02:50:14.090 --> 02:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
states and we could learn from those
 
02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
other states so in the 80s and most of
 
02:50:19.010 --> 02:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
my information here is a little bit
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
dated but the lessons are still very
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
true in the 80s the California
 
02:50:27.530 --> 02:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decided it was a good idea
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
to let
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
um let parties Sue insurance companies
 
02:50:35.210 --> 02:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
directly and they did that in the 80s uh
 
02:50:39.969 --> 02:50:39.979 align:start position:0%
and in 1979 and by 1988 in another case
 
02:50:43.450 --> 02:50:43.460 align:start position:0%
the California Supreme Court
 
02:50:48.349 --> 02:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
recognized that by by the first case by
 
02:50:51.070 --> 02:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
allowing they allow created excuse me
 
02:50:53.570 --> 02:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
multiple litigation
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
it encourages two lawsuits rather than
 
02:51:00.550 --> 02:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
one and it always is the initial suit
 
02:51:03.290 --> 02:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
against the insured followed by the suit
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
against the insurance company
 
02:51:08.210 --> 02:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:51:12.349 --> 02:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
the the effect of this recognized by the
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
California Supreme Court is that it
 
02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
increased the number of lawsuits it
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
increased the amount of fraud
 
02:51:23.690 --> 02:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
and it created uh increased uh costs of
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
insurance raising the California uh
 
02:51:31.330 --> 02:51:31.340 align:start position:0%
personal injury claims by 50 percent
 
02:51:35.770 --> 02:51:35.780 align:start position:0%
by increasing exposures for auto damage
 
02:51:40.969 --> 02:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
roughly uh almost almost double
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and it basically creates a dynamic
 
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
where those additional costs need to be
 
02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
built into the rating of insurance
 
02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
premiums and so that insurance companies
 
02:51:58.849 --> 02:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
had to raise their premiums in order to
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
adjust for the fact that there's this
 
02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary increase in claims costs
 
02:52:06.429 --> 02:52:06.439 align:start position:0%
created by adding an additional lawsuit
 
02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
to to the accident
 
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
and this is um
 
02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:14.010 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:52:14.010 --> 02:52:14.510 align:start position:0%
this is
[Music]

02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:15.950 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:52:15.950 --> 02:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:18.530 --> 02:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to abbreviate here
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and this is something that happened
 
02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
in California
 
02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
um there's also a study from West
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
Virginia that's probably about 10 years
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
old that I'll bring to the subcommittee
 
02:52:30.110 --> 02:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
and it says the same thing but let me
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
finish with One More Story just to just
 
02:52:34.610 --> 02:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
to punctuate what I've been saying
 
02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
um several years ago it could be 20 by
 
02:52:39.410 --> 02:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
now because of the way we life has gone
 
02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:40.190 align:start position:0%
now because of the way we life has gone
on

02:52:40.190 --> 02:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:52:41.870 --> 02:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
um there was a company called GMAC
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance that sold Insurance to the
 
02:52:45.250 --> 02:52:45.260 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
02:52:48.530 --> 02:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
and they made a fatal fly in one of the
 
02:52:50.690 --> 02:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
in a junk mailer that came to more than
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
20 000 people in the state of New
 
02:52:55.370 --> 02:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that said that New
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Law requires you to buy
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance and everybody in
 
02:53:01.790 --> 02:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
this room knows how wrong that is
 
02:53:04.849 --> 02:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
however the compliance lawyer at gme
 
02:53:07.610 --> 02:53:07.620 align:start position:0%
Insurance didn't see that
 
02:53:12.050 --> 02:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
so those 20 000 letters were determined
 
02:53:13.849 --> 02:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
by the insurance department properly
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
sold as to be deceptive creating 20 000
 
02:53:22.849 --> 02:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
violations of the New Hampshire law
 
02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
um if you pass this bill that one act
 
02:53:28.849 --> 02:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
those twenty thousand letters would
 
02:53:31.370 --> 02:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
result in a private cause of action
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
for uh for more than 20 million dollars
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
because the consumer protection law says
 
02:53:39.309 --> 02:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
that each violation
 
02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
the minimum damages is a a thousand
 
02:53:45.410 --> 02:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
dollars so twenty thousand times a
 
02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
thousand that's 20 million dollars so
 
02:53:49.370 --> 02:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
this was a matter that the insurance
 
02:53:51.769 --> 02:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
department resolved of a fine of
 
02:53:53.929 --> 02:53:53.939 align:start position:0%
approximately eighty or ninety thousand
 
02:53:59.210 --> 02:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
dollars so so we as you consider this
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill the question is really what's you
 
02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
need to consider what's the appropriate
 
02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
amount of punishment for GMAC insurance
 
02:54:09.230 --> 02:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
for uh sending these letters that um
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
these erroneous letters so with that
 
02:54:14.150 --> 02:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'll end my testimony thank you very
 
02:54:15.950 --> 02:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
much take any questions no we're not
 
02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:28.439 --> 02:54:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

02:54:29.630 --> 02:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to throw you one of the
 
02:54:32.510 --> 02:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
buses calling you Insurance when I said
 
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
all the insurance left I just realized
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%

um I'll keep my testimony brief so we're
 
02:54:48.769 --> 02:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
not repeating some of the prior
 
02:54:48.779 --> 02:54:50.150 align:start position:0%
not repeating some of the prior
testimony

02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:54:53.090 --> 02:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
um since 2010 with the um Dodd-Frank
 
02:54:55.010 --> 02:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
legislation there's been a very
 
02:54:55.020 --> 02:54:56.330 align:start position:0%
legislation there's been a very
aggressive

02:54:56.330 --> 02:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
aggressive
 
02:54:59.210 --> 02:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
um unfair deceptive and abusive abusive
 
02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
acts practices piece of that legislation
 
02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
that's come forth
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Bureau
 
02:55:08.990 --> 02:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
implements and enforces Federal Consumer

for the insurance industry
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%

and they'll take care of it
 
02:58:31.490 --> 02:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
second point
 
02:58:34.190 --> 02:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
when I was thinking about this last

when I was thinking about this last
evening

02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
evening
 
02:58:38.809 --> 02:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
I felt a little like I must have first
 
02:58:42.290 --> 02:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
worked on this issue with Daniel Webster
 
02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
I mean this has been here
 
02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
a long time the existing law
 
02:58:55.790 --> 02:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:58.490 --> 02:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
that was simply a rewrite of something
 
02:59:00.969 --> 02:59:00.979 align:start position:0%
that goes back as early as I believe
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
1970 we're not taking anything away from
 
02:59:07.010 --> 02:59:07.020 align:start position:0%

years
 
02:59:14.450 --> 02:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
next point

the fiscal note for the draft bill which
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
did not include the amendment that we
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit about
 
02:59:41.090 --> 02:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
said that the AG would need three new
 
02:59:41.100 --> 02:59:42.170 align:start position:0%
said that the AG would need three new
people

02:59:42.170 --> 02:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:59:45.349 --> 02:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
just to do what it was the original
 
02:59:45.359 --> 02:59:47.330 align:start position:0%
just to do what it was the original
drafted

02:59:47.330 --> 02:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
not what
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
would be required as you pointed out
 
02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
earlier representative to do what they
 
02:59:56.269 --> 02:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
are suggesting
 
03:00:00.769 --> 03:00:00.779 align:start position:0%
by contrast Mr Nye and the head of the
 
03:00:03.650 --> 03:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
consumer services division
 
03:00:06.290 --> 03:00:06.300 align:start position:0%

with that Mr chairman I know
 
03:00:20.269 --> 03:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
I could go on all afternoon but I'll see
 
03:00:21.889 --> 03:00:21.899 align:start position:0%
you at the subcommittee and thank you
 
03:00:24.050 --> 03:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
very much okay thank you

03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:00:41.929 --> 03:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
03:00:43.490 --> 03:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
Association of domestic insurance
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
companies I would like to express our
 
03:00:50.570 --> 03:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this legislation we
 
03:00:54.170 --> 03:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
came prepared to talk about legislation
 
03:00:57.170 --> 03:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
that had one little corner of consumer
 
03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
protection uh in play and come to find
 
03:01:02.570 --> 03:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
out uh you're talking about blowing the
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
whole thing up and it's uh I can't
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
emphasize enough how a serious uh this
 
03:01:12.050 --> 03:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
would be in its implications to New
 
03:01:13.849 --> 03:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens if you were to
 
03:01:17.030 --> 03:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
consider imposing regulation and
 
03:01:18.410 --> 03:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
conferring jurisdiction on the Attorney
 
03:01:18.420 --> 03:01:19.550 align:start position:0%
conferring jurisdiction on the Attorney
General

03:01:19.550 --> 03:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
General
 
03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
of insurance that is regulated now
 
03:01:25.550 --> 03:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensively by the New Hampshire
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
insurance department so what you're
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
doing is imposing a duplicate layer of
 
03:01:33.290 --> 03:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
Regulation and if you're going to do
 
03:01:36.110 --> 03:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
that let me suggest you repeal the
 
03:01:38.690 --> 03:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
consumer protection Provisions in the
 
03:01:41.690 --> 03:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
insurance statute which amount to about
 
03:01:44.570 --> 03:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
200 pages of requirements on insurance
 
03:01:47.450 --> 03:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
companies because you don't need that we
 
03:01:49.730 --> 03:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
don't need two masters if we're going to
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
be regulated by the Attorney General
 
03:01:55.130 --> 03:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
then skip the consumer regulation that
 
03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
we currently have by the insurance
 
03:02:00.170 --> 03:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
department we don't suggest it but we do
 
03:02:03.769 --> 03:02:03.779 align:start position:0%
not want to have duplicate regulation by
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
the two now you only have to turn down
 
03:02:08.530 --> 03:02:08.540 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts to see what happens
 
03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
when you tamper with the exemption from
 
03:02:15.050 --> 03:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act in
 
03:02:19.309 --> 03:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts very often you will find
 
03:02:22.610 --> 03:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
the two executive branch agencies the
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the insurance
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner at war with each other over
 
03:02:31.929 --> 03:02:31.939 align:start position:0%
Insurance regulation and
 
03:02:34.730 --> 03:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
that practice is is just something that
 
03:02:36.170 --> 03:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
we don't need in New Hampshire we don't
 
03:02:38.510 --> 03:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire and it would
 
03:02:41.469 --> 03:02:41.479 align:start position:0%
result from conferring jurisdiction
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
over Insurance to the attorney general
 
03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:48.769 align:start position:0%
over Insurance to the attorney general
also

03:02:48.769 --> 03:02:48.779 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:02:51.950 --> 03:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
in in Massachusetts you've got a
 
03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
situation in litigation that is
 
03:02:53.939 --> 03:02:55.269 align:start position:0%
situation in litigation that is
absolutely

03:02:55.269 --> 03:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
03:02:58.910 --> 03:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
deplorable uh wherein when there's a
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
simple case against an accident case or
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
a simple uh lawsuit uh claiming damages
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
routinely plaintiff's lawyers bring a
 
03:03:11.630 --> 03:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act violation it's
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in Massachusetts is a
 
03:03:17.929 --> 03:03:17.939 align:start position:0%
93a action and they tack it on to their
 
03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
claims and uh and and pursue we don't
 
03:03:24.349 --> 03:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
need that in New Hampshire so the
 
03:03:26.210 --> 03:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
biggest thing when I sit and listen to
 
03:03:28.610 --> 03:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
some of this testimony that strikes me
 
03:03:31.130 --> 03:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
is do you not understand what the
 
03:03:33.889 --> 03:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
insurance department does every day uh
 
03:03:35.690 --> 03:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
that the the staff that they have
 
03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
devoted to Consumer Protection
 
03:03:41.150 --> 03:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
um they're doing an excellent job
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
and uh this uh suggestion of a need for
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
doing something different just implies
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
that that they're not that they're not
 
03:03:51.889 --> 03:03:51.899 align:start position:0%
doing the job that they that they are
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
doing so uh if you look at it the the
 
03:03:59.389 --> 03:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
conduct that is regulated by insurance
 
03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
and if you take a look at nothing else
 
03:04:03.889 --> 03:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 417
 
03:04:07.130 --> 03:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
which goes on and on about the specific
 
03:04:09.889 --> 03:04:09.899 align:start position:0%
behaviors of insurance companies that
 
03:04:11.630 --> 03:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
are prohibited
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
let me also suggest a tool that the AG
 
03:04:17.590 --> 03:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
would not have but that's available to
 
03:04:20.570 --> 03:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
the insurance department and believe me
 
03:04:24.170 --> 03:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a major uh
 
03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
um source of Authority for insurance and
 
03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
that is over the license of insurance
 
03:04:30.769 --> 03:04:30.779 align:start position:0%
companies that's much more serious than
 
03:04:32.929 --> 03:04:32.939 align:start position:0%
a fine or paying enhanced damages or
 
03:04:36.050 --> 03:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
paying attorneys fees but insurance
 
03:04:38.330 --> 03:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
companies are regulated by the insurance
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
department which in its investigatory
 
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
Powers has the authority to revoke or
 
03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
suspend the license of an insurance
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
company in addition to imposing a fine
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's a very strong incentive to any
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
company that's thinking about violating
 
03:04:59.570 --> 03:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection laws so this
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
bill as has been mentioned
 
03:05:05.330 --> 03:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
has been proposed many times I know Jim
 
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
Hayden has dusted off some testimony
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
from several years ago we can update it
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
if we need to uh in in the subcommittee
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
but I can't emphasize enough what a bad
 
03:05:19.250 --> 03:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
idea this would be for our state thank
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
you great thanks double George okay well
 
03:05:26.330 --> 03:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
that's uh enough cards so we uh the blue

sheets uh has about 20 people businesses
 
03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:31.030 align:start position:0%
sheets uh has about 20 people businesses
from

03:05:38.150 --> 03:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh Allstate
 
03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:38.750 align:start position:0%

03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:40.610 --> 03:05:40.620 align:start position:0%

03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill except per attorney
 
03:05:50.279 --> 03:05:52.250 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill except per attorney
right

03:05:52.250 --> 03:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
and with that I will close the public
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
hearing on 459 and apologize to the
 
03:05:57.359 --> 03:05:58.490 align:start position:0%

committee and learning about all these

crazy things we do over here
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
I thought it would be refreshing to talk
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.370 --> 03:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
the committee I know you've had a long
 
03:06:27.650 --> 03:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
morning and you have a Long Afternoon
 
03:06:29.929 --> 03:06:29.939 align:start position:0%

New London and Newbury and I'm here to
 
03:06:44.330 --> 03:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 465 which is a bill that
 
03:06:46.809 --> 03:06:46.819 align:start position:0%
would prohibit
 
03:06:51.790 --> 03:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of fabric treatments and
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%

pfas
 
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
this is a strongly bipartisan Bill I
 
03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
know that this committee whether maybe
 
03:07:08.570 --> 03:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
you're glad you don't work with solid
 
03:07:11.210 --> 03:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
waste a lot even though it's very much
 
03:07:14.450 --> 03:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
part of Commerce and it is affected by
 
03:07:16.330 --> 03:07:16.340 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Clause
 
03:07:20.090 --> 03:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
as you know the Commerce Clause bans New
 
03:07:24.530 --> 03:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from or any state from or
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
prevents any state from Banning out of
 
03:07:31.250 --> 03:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
state waste and about half of the ways
 
03:07:33.469 --> 03:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
coming into our state at this point is
 
03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
from out of state going into private
 
03:07:40.490 --> 03:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
landfills I just want to give you
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
um uh some background of the Genesis of
 
03:07:47.210 --> 03:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
this bill and the and this effort
 
03:07:47.220 --> 03:07:49.570 align:start position:0%
this bill and the and this effort
um

03:07:49.570 --> 03:07:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:53.809 --> 03:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
you may recall back in 2019 China issued
 
03:07:56.090 --> 03:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
its national sword policy which
 
03:07:56.100 --> 03:07:57.889 align:start position:0%
its national sword policy which
prohibited

03:07:57.889 --> 03:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
03:07:59.630 --> 03:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
the United States to start to send its
 
03:08:05.630 --> 03:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
Plastics and its mixed paper to China
 
03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
anymore they had been the recipient of a
 
03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
lot of our uh Plastics and mixed paper
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
for recycling which through a lot of our
 
03:08:16.969 --> 03:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities and businesses into a bit
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
of a turmoil because that was where
 
03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
their recycling was going as a result of
 
03:08:25.969 --> 03:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
put in a bill to create a legislative
 
03:08:31.490 --> 03:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
study committee I chaired it and I just
 
03:08:34.010 --> 03:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
want to tell you we discovered a lot of
 
03:08:37.010 --> 03:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
things this was in 2019 and we've made a
 
03:08:40.010 --> 03:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
lot of improvements since then to our
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste program in the in New
 
03:08:46.309 --> 03:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we were so far behind
 
03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we did was we updated
 
03:08:52.969 --> 03:08:52.979 align:start position:0%
our Solid Waste diversion goals which
 
03:08:56.590 --> 03:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
hadn't been updated since 2000
 
03:09:01.070 --> 03:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
we have issued a solid waste management
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
plan a long-range Solid Waste Management
 
03:09:08.349 --> 03:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
plan which had not been done since 2003
 
03:09:12.050 --> 03:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
we regrouped Des to have a planning
 
03:09:14.450 --> 03:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
department their planning department in
 
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
the solid waste Bureau had basically
 
03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
been wiped out by budget cuts and when
 
03:09:22.429 --> 03:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
things like the national sword policy
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
come along or or other issues there's
 
03:09:29.090 --> 03:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
actually very little support for our
 
03:09:32.090 --> 03:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities and our businesses that
 
03:09:35.410 --> 03:09:35.420 align:start position:0%
are operating in really a global
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
economy trash is obviously a very
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
personal and local issue but it also has
 
03:09:47.090 --> 03:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
very broad ramifications the good news
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
is that that since 2019 there's been
 
03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
some reorganization within the solid
 
03:09:56.690 --> 03:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
waste Bureau we do now have a planning
 
03:09:59.330 --> 03:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
department of two people one of whom is
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
here and they're able to work with us on
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
on legislation and and planning
 
03:10:07.790 --> 03:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
um if that hadn't happened we'd have had
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
a very difficult time even updating our
 
03:10:13.370 --> 03:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan
 
03:10:17.090 --> 03:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
um this was all vital because all our
 
03:10:20.809 --> 03:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
area Northeast areas states are very
 
03:10:23.530 --> 03:10:23.540 align:start position:0%
aggressively pursuing
 
03:10:26.570 --> 03:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
recycling measures composting measures
 
03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
and progressively shutting down their
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
landfills and if you saw the Boston
 
03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
Globe over the weekend their front page
 
03:10:37.849 --> 03:10:37.859 align:start position:0%
article in their magazine was about the
 
03:10:41.809 --> 03:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
so the the other thing that we did is we
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
created created the solid waste working
 
03:10:51.849 --> 03:10:51.859 align:start position:0%
group which is a basically a state
 
03:10:54.889 --> 03:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group to work with des and
 
03:10:58.130 --> 03:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
the development of the uh plan and many
 
03:11:01.490 --> 03:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
other issues I chair that group and one
 
03:11:03.769 --> 03:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
of the responsibilities of the group is
 
03:11:07.010 --> 03:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
to recommend legislation pursuant to the
 
03:11:09.290 --> 03:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
plan that would help move the state
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
forward now one of the vital
 
03:11:17.389 --> 03:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
goals of the plan is to reduce toxicity
 
03:11:19.250 --> 03:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
in our waste stream
 
03:11:23.389 --> 03:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
and I think I I won't spend a lot of
 
03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
time talking about what we all know is
 
03:11:29.330 --> 03:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
the public health disaster related to
 
03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
pfas and I I want to focus on it maybe a
 
03:11:36.290 --> 03:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
little differently than than we have in
 
03:11:38.809 --> 03:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
the in the past
 
03:11:41.450 --> 03:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I want to talk about Source reduction
 
03:11:46.370 --> 03:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
and that is the basis of this bill so if
 
03:11:50.450 --> 03:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
you think about the the way stream we
 
03:11:54.590 --> 03:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
have many products that we use and they
 
03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
have pfas in them they tend to go to
 
03:12:02.030 --> 03:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
landfills and landfills produce landfill
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
leachate and the leachate many times is
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
not processed that goes to our
 
03:12:11.090 --> 03:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants and we now
 
03:12:15.010 --> 03:12:15.020 align:start position:0%
know that the EPA Health advisories
 
03:12:17.630 --> 03:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
understandably because of the the health
 
03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
effects are requiring testing down to
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion parts per quadrillion
 
03:12:26.050 --> 03:12:26.060 align:start position:0%
I mean minuscule
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
amounts and I think that's an indicator
 
03:12:32.450 --> 03:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
of the toxicity of pfas
 
03:12:36.769 --> 03:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
so we know that both our state and the
 
03:12:39.469 --> 03:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
federal government are expanding ex and
 
03:12:41.690 --> 03:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
our and our towns are expanding
 
03:12:44.809 --> 03:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
extraordinary amounts of money trying to
 
03:12:47.870 --> 03:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
deal with the pfas issue on the back
 
03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:48.830 align:start position:0%
deal with the pfas issue on the back
side

03:12:48.830 --> 03:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
so one of the best ways that we can move
 
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
forward and this is happening in many
 
03:12:57.889 --> 03:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
other states in the area is trying to
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
ban pfas as an additive to products
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
so in in um and I just want to say also
 
03:13:11.809 --> 03:13:11.819 align:start position:0%
just so we understand the whole landfill
 
03:13:15.410 --> 03:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
leachate process I've given you
 
03:13:19.870 --> 03:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
um a handout which was basically the Des
 
03:13:23.210 --> 03:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
presentation to the fiscal committee uh
 
03:13:25.730 --> 03:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
that talked about this issue and the
 
03:13:27.889 --> 03:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee requested it precisely
 
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
because of the economic concerns and if
 
03:13:33.349 --> 03:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
you go to
 
03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
um Page Six
 
03:13:39.650 --> 03:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
you will see that based on a study that
 
03:13:44.210 --> 03:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
was done in Vermont one of the um
 
03:13:44.220 --> 03:13:45.650 align:start position:0%
was done in Vermont one of the um
highest

03:13:45.650 --> 03:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
highest
 
03:13:49.490 --> 03:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
sources of pfas in our landfills is
 
03:13:49.500 --> 03:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
sources of pfas in our landfills is
carpeting

03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
carpeting
 
03:13:55.389 --> 03:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
you also if you look at this other
 
03:14:01.010 --> 03:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
handout from the solid waste Association
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see that one of the largest or
 
03:14:07.370 --> 03:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
many one of the most prolific places
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we are all exposed to pfas is
 
03:14:11.279 --> 03:14:13.190 align:start position:0%
that we are all exposed to pfas is
carpet

03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
carpet
 
03:14:16.429 --> 03:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
um it should be striking to you that
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
food packaging and makeup is a huge
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
source of direct exposure to pfas uh
 
03:14:29.150 --> 03:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
dust and then as I said carpet and then
 
03:14:32.030 --> 03:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
lastly landfill leachate so what happens
 
03:14:34.490 --> 03:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
is all these products are going into the
 
03:14:38.330 --> 03:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
landfills the pfas is leaching out most
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
I mean at this point there's no real
 
03:14:44.809 --> 03:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
regulation for uh the leachate to be
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
tested for or you know the pfas to be
 
03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
taken out and so it goes into our
 
03:14:52.910 --> 03:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants the
 
03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants of course
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to take it out because they can't
 
03:15:00.530 --> 03:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
release water into our systems right
 
03:15:04.910 --> 03:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
unless it's has basically no pfas and so
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
where do you think all the pfas and
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
other toxic chemicals are saturated down
 
03:15:15.170 --> 03:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
into when you're working with Wastewater
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
back into the landfill and if landfills
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
like Waste Management actually has a
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
reverse osmosis machine where they suck
 
03:15:26.210 --> 03:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
all these chemicals out including pfas
 
03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
it gets it into a cake and then it's
 
03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
buried in the landfill so I think it's a
 
03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
pretty clear case for if we want to get
 
03:15:37.849 --> 03:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
toxic chemicals like this out of our
 
03:15:40.849 --> 03:15:40.859 align:start position:0%
waste stream for the sake of Public
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
Health but also to save unbelievable
 
03:15:46.130 --> 03:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
amounts of money that we're already
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
expending in this state we should be
 
03:15:50.929 --> 03:15:50.939 align:start position:0%
looking at source reduction
 
03:15:54.590 --> 03:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
so when the solid waste uh working group
 
03:15:57.410 --> 03:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
looked at this we decided as initial
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
matter that we would Target carpets
 
03:16:02.990 --> 03:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
because it's such a huge uh source of
 
03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
pfas we also targeted carpets because
 
03:16:09.290 --> 03:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
Maine is doing this they have a they
 
03:16:11.870 --> 03:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing basically the same thing
 
03:16:13.570 --> 03:16:13.580 align:start position:0%
their rule will be
 
03:16:16.490 --> 03:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
effective July 1st of this year and
 
03:16:18.530 --> 03:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
Vermont is doing the same thing so this
 
03:16:20.230 --> 03:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
is regional
 
03:16:22.849 --> 03:16:22.859 align:start position:0%
there are other states in the United
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
States that are looking very closely at
 
03:16:29.530 --> 03:16:29.540 align:start position:0%
carpets there's lawsuits against
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of pfas they're starting
 
03:16:33.969 --> 03:16:33.979 align:start position:0%
to withdraw
 
03:16:37.610 --> 03:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
some of the uh the treatments but
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
honestly you know the federal government
 
03:16:43.190 --> 03:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
isn't working really quickly on this in
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
the meantime we're having to deal with
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
the pfas in our landfills and our waste
 
03:16:51.710 --> 03:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
water we're continuing to ingest them I
 
03:16:54.410 --> 03:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
mean want a huge source of P fast in
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
Wastewater is US 97 percent of us have
 
03:17:01.250 --> 03:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
pfas in our bodies because of all the
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
pfas we've consumed or otherwise inhaled
 
03:17:06.769 --> 03:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
over time
 
03:17:06.779 --> 03:17:07.610 align:start position:0%
over time
um

03:17:07.610 --> 03:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:07.620 --> 03:17:09.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:17:09.230 --> 03:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group I which I
 
03:17:17.929 --> 03:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
chair as I said uh recommended that we
 
03:17:21.349 --> 03:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
bring forth as an initial step this bill
 
03:17:26.269 --> 03:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
that would ban the sale of carpets with
 
03:17:30.370 --> 03:17:30.380 align:start position:0%
intentionally added pfas in July 1st of
 
03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
2025 it would necessitate some work
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
obviously by the um by the Des so that's
 
03:17:41.630 --> 03:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
why it has a fiscal note but I I hope
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
that the committee will focus on the
 
03:17:48.050 --> 03:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
policy aspects of this and and then move
 
03:17:51.190 --> 03:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
it to finance for the for the financial
 
03:17:55.550 --> 03:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
consideration and with that I'd be happy
 
03:17:57.010 --> 03:17:57.020 align:start position:0%
to take
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
your questions I just want to say we
 
03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
finally it's been a long time but the
 
03:18:04.910 --> 03:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
state has a solid waste management plan
 
03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
in place a lot of people don't want to
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
see it gather dust as it did you know
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
because it hadn't been updated since
 
03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
2003 and it's time to take some action
 
03:18:17.929 --> 03:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
and move forward on it and this would be
 
03:18:21.650 --> 03:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
one very strong step and it has strong
 
03:18:25.090 --> 03:18:25.100 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support thank you
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative
 
03:18:31.250 --> 03:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:18:34.730 --> 03:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
um in in the the bill the materials we
 
03:18:37.370 --> 03:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
have it talked about the cost of 98
 
03:18:39.710 --> 03:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
000 for to hire somebody
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
um to manage this but it doesn't talk
 
03:18:45.410 --> 03:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
about the costs to the state from the
 
03:18:48.650 --> 03:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
landfill and to our health and to our
 
03:18:51.050 --> 03:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
premiums from Health Care do you have
 
03:18:53.809 --> 03:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
any data about what it does to us in
 
03:18:55.730 --> 03:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
terms of costs well you know I was
 
03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
driving thank you for the question I
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's a huge issue I was driving
 
03:19:01.790 --> 03:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
down here this morning and I was
 
03:19:04.130 --> 03:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
thinking well maybe I could call the LBA
 
03:19:06.290 --> 03:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
and get sort of my idea as far as
 
03:19:10.610 --> 03:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
expenditures I mean I do remember right
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
before covid um I I was on the capital
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
budget committee for quite some time and
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
I think we set aside something like 25
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I may be wrong don't quote me but you
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
know coming through coming through
 
03:19:30.290 --> 03:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
Finance there's been a big effort to to
 
03:19:32.450 --> 03:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
help fund wastewater treatment plants
 
03:19:34.190 --> 03:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
and you know the the federal government
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
will I will be cinching down its uh
 
03:19:41.450 --> 03:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
requirements for testing for pfas how
 
03:19:42.889 --> 03:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
much money we'll get from the federal
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
government to comply with those rules I
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't know New Hampshire has been very
 
03:19:49.849 --> 03:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
aggressive because you know because of
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
the Coakley landfill and what happened
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
at peace Air Force Base to try to cinch
 
03:19:58.450 --> 03:19:58.460 align:start position:0%
down the the testing requirements for
 
03:20:01.929 --> 03:20:01.939 align:start position:0%
pfas I mean it's
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
gazillions of dollars not even to
 
03:20:07.969 --> 03:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
mention the public health effects and
 
03:20:10.490 --> 03:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
um you know you have to start somewhere
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
and we really felt like
 
03:20:16.490 --> 03:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
um carpet was a good place to start
 
03:20:18.590 --> 03:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
considering what else was going on in
 
03:20:25.610 --> 03:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:27.370 --> 03:20:27.380 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:20:30.050 --> 03:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
my family has been in the carpeting
 
03:20:30.060 --> 03:20:30.769 align:start position:0%
my family has been in the carpeting
business

03:20:30.769 --> 03:20:30.779 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:20:33.170 --> 03:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
my whole life not anymore because we're
 
03:20:34.550 --> 03:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
all dead
 
03:20:36.889 --> 03:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
uh that were laying carpets
 
03:20:39.469 --> 03:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
um but have you talked to the carpet
 
03:20:39.479 --> 03:20:40.849 align:start position:0%
um but have you talked to the carpet
industry

03:20:40.849 --> 03:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
um in the in the state
 
03:20:44.750 --> 03:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:20:48.670 --> 03:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
looked into whether there were carpet
 
03:20:52.309 --> 03:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in the state and found not
 
03:20:52.319 --> 03:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in the state and found not
none

03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
none
 
03:20:58.670 --> 03:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
so I haven't engaged at that level I
 
03:21:01.010 --> 03:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
mean there's obviously many people that
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
sell carpets
 
03:21:06.889 --> 03:21:06.899 align:start position:0%
um but I don't see them arguing for the
 
03:21:09.889 --> 03:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
ability to have pfas in their carpets
 
03:21:09.899 --> 03:21:10.969 align:start position:0%
ability to have pfas in their carpets
yeah

03:21:10.969 --> 03:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:21:13.610 --> 03:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
thanks and just a follow-up for the
 
03:21:15.530 --> 03:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
question main Claire thank you for
 
03:21:17.630 --> 03:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
taking so much of your time I know you
 
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
got paid millions of dollars to produce
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
these documents and uh I just want to
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh you're welcome for
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
doing everything you've done on this
 
03:21:30.290 --> 03:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
issue I I just think as a state we've
 
03:21:33.170 --> 03:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
really taken our eye off the ball
 
03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
um and you know as I said the air the
 
03:21:38.510 --> 03:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
whole Northeast is very aggressively
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
pursuing many many issues related to
 
03:21:43.730 --> 03:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste you folks don't deal with it
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
that much in here it's it's a huge issue
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
as far as Commerce is concerned in
 
03:21:49.439 --> 03:21:50.750 align:start position:0%
as far as Commerce is concerned in
general

03:21:50.750 --> 03:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:21:52.910 --> 03:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and I just thought it was really
 
03:21:56.510 --> 03:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
important for you to have data as you
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
talk about this and in the in the
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
document the digital document that you
 
03:22:03.170 --> 03:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
got with my testimony I put more
 
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks in than you ever want to read
 
03:22:08.090 --> 03:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps in your life but you can click
 
03:22:10.130 --> 03:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
through and see the plan you can see our
 
03:22:13.070 --> 03:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
new diversion goal goals as you know
 
03:22:15.889 --> 03:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
they've discovered pfas and freshwater
 
03:22:18.349 --> 03:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
fish there's a reason they call for it
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
forever chemicals this stuff is created
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
so tight that it doesn't bust up so the
 
03:22:27.769 --> 03:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
idea of destructing it is is pretty
 
03:22:30.610 --> 03:22:30.620 align:start position:0%
challenging so Source reduction on this
 
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
yes sorry sorry representative brazili
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you a quick scoping question so do
 
03:22:43.730 --> 03:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know the percentage of rugs that
 
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
would carpets that would no longer be
 
03:22:49.969 --> 03:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
for sale and a list of the specific
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
products and manufacturers I'm wondering
 
03:22:56.090 --> 03:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
how you would keep track of this well I
 
03:22:58.610 --> 03:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
think that is something that Des is
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about concerned about because
 
03:23:05.450 --> 03:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
if this bill did pass you know they
 
03:23:07.250 --> 03:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
would be the ones that would have to
 
03:23:10.389 --> 03:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
issue the regulations to try to
 
03:23:14.389 --> 03:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
understand that I I guess I would say I
 
03:23:16.190 --> 03:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
have to believe they're a finite number
 
03:23:19.550 --> 03:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
of companies that make carpets
 
03:23:22.130 --> 03:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
um so there shouldn't be that that that
 
03:23:25.849 --> 03:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
many and under the under the bill they
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
have to provide certification so that
 
03:23:31.010 --> 03:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
would be one way that Des could keep
 
03:23:33.229 --> 03:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
track of it I mean the other thing I I
 
03:23:35.929 --> 03:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
would point out is that that you know as
 
03:23:38.210 --> 03:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
I said Maine and Vermont are they
 
03:23:40.490 --> 03:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
they're going to kick this type of a
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
provision in on July 1st and we can also
 
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
learn from them because this wouldn't be
 
03:23:49.309 --> 03:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
effective until July 1st of 2025. if the
 
03:23:52.990 --> 03:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
if the um committee's stuck with that
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:00.469 --> 03:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sullivan this is kind
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
of a tie on question you should answer
 
03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:02.929 align:start position:0%
of a tie on question you should answer
but

03:24:02.929 --> 03:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
are we aware that there are rugs and
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
carpets that are currently not produced
 
03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
with pfas because I mean they're
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
starting to they're starting to produce
 
03:24:14.330 --> 03:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
them so it's not like um this goes into
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
effect and suddenly there's one rug or
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you sir one more
 
03:24:25.439 --> 03:24:26.570 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you sir one more
question

03:24:26.570 --> 03:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
quick question uh sure representative
 
03:24:31.729 --> 03:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
Terry so it uh listening uh to how
 
03:24:33.590 --> 03:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
critical uh this is and how you want to
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
get at it and how the neighboring states
 
03:24:37.969 --> 03:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
are a little further down the road so to
 
03:24:37.979 --> 03:24:38.990 align:start position:0%
are a little further down the road so to
speak

03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
um why is the effective date so far out
 
03:24:44.090 --> 03:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh over over two years from now
 
03:24:44.100 --> 03:24:46.250 align:start position:0%
uh over over two years from now
well

03:24:46.250 --> 03:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:24:49.790 --> 03:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
that is you know obviously that's a
 
03:24:51.530 --> 03:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
judgment call
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so you have well I'll tell you so one
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
of the concerns is for the department to
 
03:25:01.370 --> 03:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
get uh it's the you know it has to
 
03:25:03.410 --> 03:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
figure out how it's going to regulate it
 
03:25:06.530 --> 03:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
so if we pass the law that has to
 
03:25:09.610 --> 03:25:09.620 align:start position:0%
um that has to happen generate rules
 
03:25:11.929 --> 03:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
generate rules sorry and make rules
 
03:25:13.790 --> 03:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's right they have to make the rules
 
03:25:16.190 --> 03:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing is that you
 
03:25:19.010 --> 03:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
know I think in I mean you guys know
 
03:25:21.170 --> 03:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
more about Commerce than I do but in any
 
03:25:23.690 --> 03:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
new rule that you would pass that would
 
03:25:26.269 --> 03:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
affect comment uh Commerce you'd want to
 
03:25:29.450 --> 03:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
give the industry time to to come up to
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
speed I mean you get rid of their old
 
03:25:35.330 --> 03:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
inventory yeah and and the other thing I
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
I would just say is it I I want to point
 
03:25:40.969 --> 03:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
out that this doesn't apply to you know
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
used drugs and sort of the aftermarket
 
03:25:46.969 --> 03:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
it applies to new rugs and the idea is
 
03:25:48.889 --> 03:25:48.899 align:start position:0%
that you're really trying to get people
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
away from
 
03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:51.370 align:start position:0%
away from
um

03:25:51.370 --> 03:25:51.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:54.410 --> 03:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh putting pfas in their rugs and I
 
03:25:56.030 --> 03:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
guess we have to learn how to clean
 
03:25:58.190 --> 03:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
better so we don't have to rely so much
 
03:26:01.729 --> 03:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
I mean that's what it's all about right
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's the furniture right anyway I
 
03:26:09.229 --> 03:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
remember Scotchgard yeah that was that
 
03:26:11.389 --> 03:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
was highly promoted wow well in our
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
Gore-Tex I mean textiles makeup food
 
03:26:17.809 --> 03:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
packaging scary subject everywhere thank
 
03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
you very much great thank you okay uh we
 
03:26:22.969 --> 03:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
do have the department here and Michael
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:31.849 --> 03:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh good good afternoon
 
03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman unfortunately yes thank you
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your attention and
 
03:26:37.370 --> 03:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
this matter and cutting into your lunch
 
03:26:39.050 --> 03:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
break for this yeah I will keep my
 
03:26:42.530 --> 03:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
comments uh very brief the department is
 
03:26:44.450 --> 03:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
not taking an official position on this
 
03:26:47.210 --> 03:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
bill but we do have a concern about the
 
03:26:48.769 --> 03:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
the resources that would be necessary
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
however that being said we do think that
 
03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
reducing pfas in the waste stream is a
 
03:26:56.090 --> 03:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
very important issue it's a high
 
03:26:57.889 --> 03:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
priority in our Solid Waste Management
 
03:27:00.530 --> 03:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
plan as representative evil mentioned
 
03:27:02.210 --> 03:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
but one of the things about this is that
 
03:27:04.010 --> 03:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
it would require the department to to
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
basically regulate a Marketplace we
 
03:27:07.849 --> 03:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
currently our Solid Waste program
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't regulate a Marketplace per se or
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
distribution of products
 
03:27:14.690 --> 03:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
um but this would expand our
 
03:27:17.090 --> 03:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to regulate uh you know
 
03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
distribution and sale of carpets and
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
that that sort of Industry which is kind
 
03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
of a new
 
03:27:24.530 --> 03:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
novel thing for us
 
03:27:24.540 --> 03:27:25.309 align:start position:0%
novel thing for us
um

03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh so with that being said our estimate
 
03:27:29.210 --> 03:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note is for one full-time
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
equivalent to be able to adequately kind
 
03:27:34.190 --> 03:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
of stand up this new program uh do the
 
03:27:36.050 --> 03:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
research necessary for how to regulate
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
that sector who the players are what
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
kind of rules would be would be
 
03:27:43.309 --> 03:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
necessary so there is uh you know a fair
 
03:27:45.170 --> 03:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
amount of resources that would be
 
03:27:47.690 --> 03:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
necessary to do that work however the
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't make any provision for that
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
so that's really our primary concern the
 
03:27:53.690 --> 03:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
only other thing that I wanted to
 
03:27:56.090 --> 03:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
mention is that as representative evil
 
03:27:58.610 --> 03:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are other states that
 
03:28:00.889 --> 03:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
are kind of out ahead of this issue
 
03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
um they're they're kind of you know
 
03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
Further Along on this than we are right
 
03:28:04.140 --> 03:28:05.389 align:start position:0%
Further Along on this than we are right
now

03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:28:05.399 --> 03:28:06.170 align:start position:0%
now
um

03:28:06.170 --> 03:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:06.180 --> 03:28:08.150 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:10.010 --> 03:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know there might be some some
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
something to be said for kind of an
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
interstate uh approach uh multi-state
 
03:28:16.910 --> 03:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
organizations have been done in the past
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
for uh chemicals Clearing Houses and
 
03:28:21.469 --> 03:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
things like that there is actually an
 
03:28:23.870 --> 03:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
example uh that was established in 2008
 
03:28:25.729 --> 03:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
called the Interstate Chemicals
 
03:28:29.570 --> 03:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse or ic2 and that has been
 
03:28:31.929 --> 03:28:31.939 align:start position:0%
used currently it's being used for
 
03:28:34.370 --> 03:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
reporting by manufacturers about
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
chemicals of concern and children's
 
03:28:38.990 --> 03:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
products one of the things that we
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate may happen is that these
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
other states like Maine for example and
 
03:28:46.130 --> 03:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
Vermont may look to work with ic2 to
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
create kind of a more of an interstate
 
03:28:51.710 --> 03:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse for this information so if
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
that were to be established Des might be
 
03:28:55.370 --> 03:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
able to plug into that a little bit more
 
03:28:58.250 --> 03:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
easily and have lower overhead and
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
reduce our you know expenditures
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
relative to having a full-time we might
 
03:29:03.769 --> 03:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
be able to get away with a part-time
 
03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
staff person to do that kind of work
 
03:29:07.250 --> 03:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
because it would be a lot of the
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
research and information on who the
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
players are would be kind of done
 
03:29:13.610 --> 03:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
through that ic2 organization so I just
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to recommend that as a potential
 
03:29:15.600 --> 03:29:17.150 align:start position:0%
want to recommend that as a potential
consideration

03:29:17.150 --> 03:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to be taking we
 
03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
are going to have a subcommittee so okay
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing you there all
 
03:29:25.969 --> 03:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you
 
03:29:28.910 --> 03:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
right very very good one card left Henry
 
03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
vayu from Waste Management in support of
 
03:29:33.410 --> 03:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
and he's going to do it in one minute
 
03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's all I need
 
03:29:39.769 --> 03:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Henry vayu
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of Waste
 
03:29:44.269 --> 03:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
Management uh Waste Management operates
 
03:29:47.210 --> 03:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
the turnkey landfill in Rochester that's
 
03:29:49.729 --> 03:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
where a lot of the trash uh in the state
 
03:29:52.190 --> 03:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
goes to just here to register our
 
03:29:52.200 --> 03:29:53.349 align:start position:0%
goes to just here to register our
support

03:29:53.349 --> 03:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
obviously uh keeping pfas out of
 
03:29:59.650 --> 03:29:59.660 align:start position:0%
products on the front end
 
03:30:02.330 --> 03:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
avoids us having to deal with it on the
 
03:30:06.050 --> 03:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
back end uh in in the landfill and uh
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:30:10.250 --> 03:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'd take any questions
 
03:30:13.510 --> 03:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you very much Henry okay
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh on the blue sheet we have 66 people
 
03:30:20.110 --> 03:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
in support one opposed
 
03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
and on the side overnight and then the
 
03:30:26.929 --> 03:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
daytime uh we have several
 
03:30:29.570 --> 03:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
representatives are in support and Des
 
03:30:32.090 --> 03:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
just this doesn't take a position and
 
03:30:33.769 --> 03:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
 
03:30:33.779 --> 03:30:35.210 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
hearing

03:30:35.210 --> 03:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we're tight on time 45
 
03:30:39.120 --> 03:30:40.550 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we're tight on time 45
minutes

03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:41.210 align:start position:0%
minutes
um

03:30:41.210 --> 03:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:43.490 --> 03:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
so we could but I'll tell everybody that
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to start at 1 30 over at
 
03:30:47.570 --> 03:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
reps Hall
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
um I normally would never have done I
 
03:30:51.530 --> 03:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
haven't been in reps Hole uh doing a
 
03:30:53.150 --> 03:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
build since
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know you can't even remember it
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
was it was years and years and years ago
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
I did it
 
03:30:59.929 --> 03:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
um so I I was not so much inclined to do
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
it because I thought we had a big enough
 
03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
room but I'm told that there's going to
 
03:31:06.110 --> 03:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
be hordes of people coming in and trying
 
03:31:08.330 --> 03:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
to convince us not to pass these bills
 
03:31:10.969 --> 03:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
or pass a bill so uh at that point
 
03:31:13.190 --> 03:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I made the the decision that
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
we'll meet over there
 
03:31:17.330 --> 03:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
um however I I will say that that I will
 
03:31:19.490 --> 03:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
put Implement a rule I've never done
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
ever done which I will implement the
 
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
three-minute rule
 
03:31:26.090 --> 03:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
having said that I might change my mind
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
if I get into the room and suddenly see
 
03:31:29.389 --> 03:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
that there really isn't all these people
 
03:31:32.269 --> 03:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
and the hordes didn't show up but I just
 
03:31:34.010 --> 03:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
wanted everybody to know that
 
03:31:36.290 --> 03:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
um uh you know what the process says and
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
I will keep emphasizing to that for
 
03:31:40.010 --> 03:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
people not to repeat themselves but of
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
course if people are going to come in
 
03:31:43.250 --> 03:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
and say well we should pass it or not
 
03:31:44.809 --> 03:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
03:31:47.210 --> 03:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
um you know it's kind of hard to say uh
 
03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't repeat yourself when everybody
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
when you had the same but I'm sure
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
people have stories about why they think
 
03:31:55.010 --> 03:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't pass it you know and
 
03:31:57.170 --> 03:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
usually wrapped around children and then
 
03:31:58.969 --> 03:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
and then why we should wrap it around
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
why are we leaving tax money on the
 
03:32:04.849 --> 03:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
table so having said that I you know I'm
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
prepared to I don't want to get into a
 
03:32:08.450 --> 03:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
position where everybody thought I was I
 
03:32:10.370 --> 03:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
was mean and nasty and shut shut down
 
03:32:12.769 --> 03:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
testimony but I just want you all to
 
03:32:13.729 --> 03:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
know that
 
03:32:16.250 --> 03:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
this is pretty straightforward in terms
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
of what the discussion and I wish I
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
could say to everybody just well just
 
03:32:21.050 --> 03:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
tell us what you think is good or bad
 
03:32:22.849 --> 03:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
about the two bills you know the bills
 
03:32:24.530 --> 03:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's in front of us because it will be
 
03:32:26.570 --> 03:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
taking each bill separately
 
03:32:28.370 --> 03:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
um but I'm sure we're going to stray
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
stray from that with just either for or
 
03:32:33.290 --> 03:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
against it so
 
03:32:33.300 --> 03:32:34.150 align:start position:0%
against it so
um

03:32:34.150 --> 03:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:37.370 --> 03:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
so be in reps Hall at 1 30.
 
03:32:39.290 --> 03:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
and I will keep telling everybody the
 
03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.910 --> 03:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
so tomorrow morning
 
03:32:52.490 --> 03:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
um I I at this point I uh uh this what
 
03:32:54.110 --> 03:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
was important about today is we got all
 
03:32:55.370 --> 03:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
the bills that have to be out of
 
03:32:56.809 --> 03:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
committee early
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
so that means we will be doing the
 
03:33:01.729 --> 03:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on all these bills uh
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
Wednesday February 1st and we have to
 
03:33:07.490 --> 03:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
vote them out uh the next two weeks
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
there we've got to vote them out so by
 
03:33:11.150 --> 03:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
that Wednesday two weeks later what
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
first the fourth fourteenth the
 
03:33:14.210 --> 03:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day or the day after
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day we have to have all
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
these bills we heard today
 
03:33:22.190 --> 03:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
um uh out of committee and my my take on
 
03:33:23.690 --> 03:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
it is to be honest with you we'll go
 
03:33:24.889 --> 03:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
through the subcommittee so we'll work
 
03:33:26.929 --> 03:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
on and process them but I think a lot of
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
them are going to really need to be just
 
03:33:29.929 --> 03:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
retained because they're going to need
 
03:33:31.250 --> 03:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to need a lot more work
 
03:33:32.510 --> 03:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know even though someone can say
 
03:33:33.889 --> 03:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
well this is a simple Amendment nothing
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:40.429 --> 03:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
so I would say I I wouldn't be surprised
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
if they canceled tomorrow
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
so but I I you know I would know you
 
03:33:46.130 --> 03:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm the last person I know a
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff but yeah right but I think
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
they're what they're doing is they put
 
03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
it right up on this the this uh web page
 
03:33:53.279 --> 03:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
it right up on this the this uh web page
right

03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
they are texting yeah well that's right
 
03:33:59.690 --> 03:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
I got the word my wife's phone call I
 
03:34:00.889 --> 03:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
got a phone and I said how did they even
 
03:34:03.769 --> 03:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
know that number but so they know
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
everything right so uh but it's not a
 
03:34:08.269 --> 03:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
big deal if we don't have that day
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
because then I'll just reschedule all
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
those bills to another day so all right
 
03:34:16.610 --> 03:34:16.620 align:start position:0%

03:34:19.070 --> 03:34:19.080 align:start position:0%

Committee

04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
04:32:52.250 --> 04:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
I have to say that even though I've been
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
a legislator for 38 years only once
 
04:32:57.290 --> 04:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
before I've ever done this to be up here
 
04:33:00.050 --> 04:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I think this little dense here of
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
mine way back when but uh
 
04:33:05.810 --> 04:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
so what are we going to do is uh we're
 
04:33:07.609 --> 04:33:07.619 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to take up the two bills
 
04:33:10.369 --> 04:33:10.379 align:start position:0%
in the in the order they are when you
 
04:33:12.849 --> 04:33:12.859 align:start position:0%
testify through the bill Please
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
be aware that we we're going to try to
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
do a three-minute rule here and that
 
04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
you'll keep your keep your points short
 
04:33:23.209 --> 04:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
and brief and to the point so that we we
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
can get home before the snowstorm
 
04:33:29.631 --> 04:33:29.641 align:start position:0%
um and I realized that there's there's
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
two kinds of approaches who can either
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
come in and want to speak about what you
 
04:33:36.410 --> 04:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
whether you're for or against marijuana
 
04:33:36.420 --> 04:33:37.849 align:start position:0%
whether you're for or against marijuana
legislation

04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:33:40.369 --> 04:33:40.379 align:start position:0%
and and that hopefully you can say that
 
04:33:43.789 --> 04:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
in three minutes if you have uh more
 
04:33:46.490 --> 04:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
attention to the two different bills I
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
want you to uh we take each bill
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
separately so I want you to please focus
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
in on the bill and if you want to talk
 
04:33:55.849 --> 04:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
about the pros and cons of each of the
 
04:33:58.609 --> 04:33:58.619 align:start position:0%
two different bills that's okay too but
 
04:34:00.769 --> 04:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
please try to do it in three minutes
 
04:34:00.779 --> 04:34:04.490 align:start position:0%
please try to do it in three minutes
okay

04:34:04.490 --> 04:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.500 --> 04:34:06.051 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:34:06.051 --> 04:34:06.061 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
we'll start off with the prime sponsor
 
04:34:14.689 --> 04:34:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.429 --> 04:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
am I in the right spot
 
04:34:18.410 --> 04:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
good enough that's good yeah it's great
 
04:34:20.150 --> 04:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I've always wanted
 
04:34:23.090 --> 04:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
to see you up at that Podium I gave you
 
04:34:25.609 --> 04:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
that opportunity uh Jason Osborne
 
04:34:28.970 --> 04:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 2 uh representing Auburn
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh Candia in Deerfield
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be real quick uh today
 
04:34:36.289 --> 04:34:36.299 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot more important and
 
04:34:37.970 --> 04:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable people behind me uh ready
 
04:34:40.490 --> 04:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
to testify uh and I don't really want to
 
04:34:42.410 --> 04:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
talk about any of the details of this
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
bill that's in front of you because I
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
know how this committee works and I know
 
04:34:47.209 --> 04:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
you got your own tricks up your sleeves
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
and you're going to do whatever you want
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
anyway and I'm happy to help you do that
 
04:34:55.010 --> 04:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
um what I would like to say is that what
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
you are looking at is a the result of a
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
number of months of work of an entire
 
04:35:05.330 --> 04:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
Coalition of groups and Advocates every
 
04:35:07.970 --> 04:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
everything from the business side to the
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
consumer side to the Civil Rights side
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
to the economic Liberty side as well as
 
04:35:16.490 --> 04:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
the recovery Community people concerned
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
about child safety just all all of the
 
04:35:21.289 --> 04:35:21.299 align:start position:0%
different uh points of view and
 
04:35:23.631 --> 04:35:23.641 align:start position:0%
perspectives involved and so I hope
 
04:35:26.449 --> 04:35:26.459 align:start position:0%
you'll take the time to
 
04:35:28.570 --> 04:35:28.580 align:start position:0%
consider everybody's concern as we
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
determine a final product to put out as
 
04:35:35.631 --> 04:35:35.641 align:start position:0%
we all know this house has put out some
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
sort of marijuana legislation basically
 
04:35:39.890 --> 04:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
every year for the last as long as I've
 
04:35:41.631 --> 04:35:41.641 align:start position:0%
been around maybe even as long as you've
 
04:35:43.869 --> 04:35:43.879 align:start position:0%
been around Mr chairman I don't know but
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
maybe not quite that long
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
um and it always runs into a roadblock
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere and uh but this Committee in
 
04:35:52.490 --> 04:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
particular has not had the opportunity
 
04:35:55.849 --> 04:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
to take a stab at uh at coming up with a
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
solution and I'm really excited to see
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
what we can do here and um
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
you know it's it it's a time we get done
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
something done and if I could just throw
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
in my two cents about what I hope to see
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
in the final product is that we uh we
 
04:36:12.529 --> 04:36:12.539 align:start position:0%
keep the barriers to entry into this
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
industry as low as possible so as to
 
04:36:17.209 --> 04:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
keep it from being overwhelmed by uh
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
large corporations from out of state or
 
04:36:21.769 --> 04:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
out of country uh and that we keep uh
 
04:36:21.779 --> 04:36:23.631 align:start position:0%
out of country uh and that we keep uh
the

04:36:23.631 --> 04:36:23.641 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:23.641 --> 04:36:24.769 align:start position:0%
the
uh

04:36:24.769 --> 04:36:24.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:27.051 --> 04:36:27.061 align:start position:0%
I guess the tax or the margin that the
 
04:36:28.609 --> 04:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
state is going to extract from this
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
industry as low as possible so as to
 
04:36:33.410 --> 04:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
prevent the the black market from being
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
able to maintain control and that we're
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
able to take this industry away from the
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
Thugs and gangsters and put it in the
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
hands of law abiding citizens so thank
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%

04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%

04:36:57.070 --> 04:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
I forget where where is he
 
04:37:03.410 --> 04:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
Senator is he not in the room
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%

yes okay great two senators two for the
 
04:37:13.090 --> 04:37:13.100 align:start position:0%

04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good afternoon
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
members of the committee we appreciate
 
04:37:19.730 --> 04:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
uh being welcomed into the your chamber
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
to testify about this important bill we
 
04:37:24.769 --> 04:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
are testifying in support of the bill as
 
04:37:29.090 --> 04:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors wanting to show the
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
bicameral support for this concept you
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to speak specifically
 
04:37:34.670 --> 04:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
to the provisions of the bill I think
 
04:37:36.051 --> 04:37:36.061 align:start position:0%
you know there are a lot of people that
 
04:37:38.090 --> 04:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
are working on making sure that this is
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
a bill that fits New Hampshire but what
 
04:37:43.189 --> 04:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
I will say is as an elected official
 
04:37:44.929 --> 04:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
Senator Fenton and I are both
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
Millennials Millennial representation in
 
04:37:50.269 --> 04:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate and that's important because
 
04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
you know we have a real hard time in New
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attracting young folks it's a
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
real problem right we know we have an
 
04:37:58.609 --> 04:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
Asian population that we need to really
 
04:38:02.269 --> 04:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
think about how we are going to build a
 
04:38:03.890 --> 04:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
future New Hampshire that we're all
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
going to be proud of and I think
 
04:38:07.849 --> 04:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
legalization is not the Panacea to solve
 
04:38:10.250 --> 04:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
that problem but it is an important part
 
04:38:12.170 --> 04:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
of that conversation and I know that
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
because I spent the entire summer
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
talking to voters right in my district I
 
04:38:16.561 --> 04:38:17.510 align:start position:0%
talking to voters right in my district I
represent

04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:38:18.890 --> 04:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I did not introduce
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
myself Senator Rebecca Whitley I
 
04:38:22.490 --> 04:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
represent District 15. that includes the
 
04:38:24.170 --> 04:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
communities of Concord bow and Hopkinton
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
and what I know from talking to the
 
04:38:28.609 --> 04:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
voters in my district that this is an
 
04:38:30.769 --> 04:38:30.779 align:start position:0%
issue they care about right and I would
 
04:38:32.689 --> 04:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
say you know we do know from polling
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
that 74 of Grant state are support
 
04:38:38.090 --> 04:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
legalization 74 I would you know be
 
04:38:39.769 --> 04:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
really hard-pressed to come up with any
 
04:38:41.449 --> 04:38:41.459 align:start position:0%
other political issue
 
04:38:43.010 --> 04:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
that has that support I would be
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
hard-pressed right if any you know
 
04:38:47.090 --> 04:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you be elated if you got that
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
kind of support at the polls right so I
 
04:38:51.170 --> 04:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
think that's important to recognize that
 
04:38:53.631 --> 04:38:53.641 align:start position:0%
and then also I will say when I'm
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
talking to younger folks I would say
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
that number is even higher and so I
 
04:39:01.490 --> 04:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
think we have to be you know our work in
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
the state house has to be reflective of
 
04:39:05.929 --> 04:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
the issues that our constituents and our
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
voters care about and I would say
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
legalization is one of those
 
04:39:11.330 --> 04:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
Senator Donovan Fenton district 10 and
 
04:39:13.131 --> 04:39:13.141 align:start position:0%
all he can do is uh Echo what Senator
 
04:39:14.209 --> 04:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
Whitley said you know we're talking
 
04:39:16.250 --> 04:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
about 70 percent of the population wants
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
this and she mentioned a lot of young
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
people but also a lot of old people you
 
04:39:22.490 --> 04:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
know we're a diver a diverse State and
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
what Senator Whitley said I want to Echo
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
was that you know on my campaign Trail
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
around my district I didn't meet a
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
single voter single constituent that was
 
04:39:32.449 --> 04:39:32.459 align:start position:0%
against legalization this is an issue
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
that affects all of us and is important
 
04:39:35.330 --> 04:39:35.340 align:start position:0%

639 uh build a legalized and regulate
 
04:41:17.930 --> 04:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
adult use recreational Cannabis I'm a
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this legislation because
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's past time the granite state joined
 
04:41:23.628 --> 04:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
every single one of our New England
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors to legalize marijuana
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
we Remain the only state in New England
 
04:41:30.890 --> 04:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
where residents are still arrested for
 
04:41:32.930 --> 04:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
marijuana possession which puts our
 
04:41:35.170 --> 04:41:35.180 align:start position:0%
communities at an economic and social
 
04:41:37.970 --> 04:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
disadvantage racial disparity and
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the current New Hampshire
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis law has negatively impacted our
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
state despite disproportionate levels of
 
04:41:48.410 --> 04:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
use across weight across race the
 
04:41:50.090 --> 04:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
unequal enforcement of New Hampshire
 
04:41:51.890 --> 04:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
cannabis laws put black people at
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
increased likelihood of Marijuana arrest
 
04:41:57.288 --> 04:41:57.298 align:start position:0%
and charge which leads to an increased
 
04:41:58.850 --> 04:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
likelihood of the loss of employment
 
04:42:02.208 --> 04:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
housing financial aid eligibility and
 
04:42:03.530 --> 04:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
child custody
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
these collateral harms of prohibition
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a lasting impact on Granite State
 
04:42:09.770 --> 04:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
families and communities while the vast
 
04:42:11.930 --> 04:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
majority of granite Staters support
 
04:42:14.530 --> 04:42:14.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have seen where we've been and how
 
04:42:19.250 --> 04:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's harming communities while the rest
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
of our New England neighbors profit from
 
04:42:24.050 --> 04:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
Cannabis legalization now after years of
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
discussion on the issue we know where we
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
need to go we know that marijuana
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
legalization will bring much needed
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
economic growth to New Hampshire
 
04:42:32.280 --> 04:42:33.590 align:start position:0%
economic growth to New Hampshire
uh

04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:35.930 --> 04:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
data from states that have legalized
 
04:42:37.550 --> 04:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana show us that job growth and
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
labor income increased as a result of
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis industry
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh this legislation House Bill 639 will
 
04:42:46.970 --> 04:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
allow more Granite Staters to become
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
business owners and entrepreneurs that's
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way this model will
 
04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
also support our retirement system with
 
04:42:55.610 --> 04:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
percentage of funds from the sale of
 
04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana to be credited to the New
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system to help
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
offset the unfunded accrued
 
04:43:04.670 --> 04:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
liability returning money to the
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
retirement system with the tax structure
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
of this legislation will result in

04:43:59.530 --> 04:43:59.540 align:start position:0%
into the states after they legalize
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
across the U.S we have 21 states that
 
04:44:05.810 --> 04:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
have legalized in 21 29 that have not
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately for New Hampshire there's
 
04:44:09.050 --> 04:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
other states we can look to to see how
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's going for them
 
04:44:12.530 --> 04:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
in Colorado legalized marijuana has not
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
reduced the black market activity as
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
expected in 2020 Colorado law
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement intelligence reports stated
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
that there were 278 Black Market cases
 
04:44:22.368 --> 04:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
in 2019.
 
04:44:25.010 --> 04:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
in 2021 law enforcement disrupted an
 
04:44:26.690 --> 04:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
operation involving millions of dollars
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%

in addition to that other marijuana drug
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
busts have included Mexican and

Colombian cartels as well as gangs from

every dollar of revenue generated in
 
04:44:43.368 --> 04:44:43.378 align:start position:0%

increase policy policing
 
04:44:55.128 --> 04:44:55.138 align:start position:0%

it
 
04:46:03.288 --> 04:46:03.298 align:start position:0%
in 2021 approximately 10 years after
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
legalization Colorado is starting to
 
04:46:06.530 --> 04:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
come to grips with this public health
 
04:46:09.770 --> 04:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
emergency and their legislature put in
 
04:46:13.070 --> 04:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
HB 1317 this bill was a bipartisan
 
04:46:14.930 --> 04:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
effort sponsored by the Democrat speaker
 
04:46:17.208 --> 04:46:17.218 align:start position:0%
of the house signed by the Democratic
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
governor Colorado's requirement now
 
04:46:22.128 --> 04:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
limits uh marijuana concentrate

relationships with Physicians
 
04:46:31.128 --> 04:46:31.138 align:start position:0%
Colorado legislatures are moving forward
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
with these risk excuse me risk
 
04:46:36.110 --> 04:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
mitigation measures
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
following the warnings of many of their
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
health experts one health professional
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
the medical director of the state's
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
largest non-public psychiatric hospital
 
04:46:48.288 --> 04:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
said quote the epidemic I'm sorry the
 
04:46:50.330 --> 04:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
epidemic the epidemic of marijuana
 
04:46:52.970 --> 04:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
addiction quote threatens to swallow the
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
lives of a whole generation of
 
04:46:55.200 --> 04:46:57.170 align:start position:0%
lives of a whole generation of
coloradans

04:46:57.170 --> 04:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
coloradans
 
04:46:59.570 --> 04:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
so let's now just turn our attention to
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont in 2020 two years after
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
recreational legalization was passed
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
into law the Vermont Public Health
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
issued the following statement quote
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana use is a significant public
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
health problem in Vermont and it is
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
getting worse
 
04:47:16.190 --> 04:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the Vermont Medical Society
 
04:47:18.890 --> 04:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
released a resolution to advocate for a
 
04:47:20.810 --> 04:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
number of measures to include a
 
04:47:23.628 --> 04:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on the advertising marketing
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
and promotion of cannabis in the state
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
of Vermont
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
a requirement that all cannabis grown
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
produced or sold whether through
 
04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
dispensaries or retail establishments be
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
less than 15 percent THC it's worthwhile
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
to note that in our own medical
 
04:47:40.250 --> 04:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
marijuana program here in New Hampshire
 
04:47:42.530 --> 04:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
we actually have no limits on that and
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
you could go to their websites and find
 
04:47:47.208 --> 04:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
Edibles that are 90 percent THC Plus 90
 
04:47:49.730 --> 04:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
plus THC
 
04:47:52.250 --> 04:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh another thing that they also did is
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
they put out the medical association is
 
04:47:56.090 --> 04:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
requesting that a requirement they're
 
04:47:57.650 --> 04:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
all written in Internet advertising of
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
cannabis displayed up-to-date
 
04:48:01.128 --> 04:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
evidence-based warnings in large
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
typeface which could should include the
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
following conditions psychosis impaired
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
driving addiction suicide uncontrolled
 
04:48:11.448 --> 04:48:11.458 align:start position:0%
vomiting and the harm to fetus and
 
04:48:12.890 --> 04:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
nursing babies
 
04:48:14.330 --> 04:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
and with regard to the relationship
 
04:48:17.448 --> 04:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
between marijuana and addiction a 2021
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
University of Vermont presentation on
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
childhood mental health cited the
 
04:48:25.010 --> 04:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
following approximately nine people nine
 
04:48:26.208 --> 04:48:26.218 align:start position:0%
percent of people who use marijuana
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
become dependent that rate increases to
 
04:48:30.770 --> 04:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
one in six of those who start before the
 
04:48:32.810 --> 04:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
age of eighteen
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
and is likely that thirty percent of
 
04:48:36.410 --> 04:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
those who currently use marijuana meet
 
04:48:38.090 --> 04:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
the criteria for having a cannabis use
 
04:48:38.100 --> 04:48:39.288 align:start position:0%
the criteria for having a cannabis use
disorder

04:48:39.288 --> 04:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
and almost three percent of 12 to 17
 
04:48:43.010 --> 04:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
year olds
 
04:48:45.050 --> 04:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
are already already have a cannabis use
 
04:48:45.060 --> 04:48:46.670 align:start position:0%
are already already have a cannabis use
disorder

04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
04:48:49.610 --> 04:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
so Vermont has you know earned the
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
distinction with actually some of the
 
04:48:53.330 --> 04:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
highest childhood rates of using
 
04:48:55.970 --> 04:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the United States
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
so other states that are dealing with
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
this every state that either they've
 
04:49:01.550 --> 04:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
medically allowed it or recreationally
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
allowed it they're dealing with one of
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
this uh relatively new syndrome that has
 
04:49:08.090 --> 04:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
emerged called cannabinoid hyperemesis
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
syndrome which is a severe vomiting
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
condition in retrospect now in a
 
04:49:14.090 --> 04:49:14.100 align:start position:0%

treated for this syndrome at a variety
 
04:49:19.010 --> 04:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
of locations across the U.S it is
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
estimated that the cost per patient just
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%

04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per hospital visit to
 
04:49:27.050 --> 04:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
treat this
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
with the never-ending attempts to
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
legalize across the states it is also
 
04:49:32.330 --> 04:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
noteworthy to recognize that many
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
elected officials are still willing to
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
take a cautious approach
 
04:49:37.850 --> 04:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
this past year Delaware's Democratic
 
04:49:39.410 --> 04:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
governor John Carney vetoed a
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
legalization Bill stating that it was
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
quote in the best interest of the state
 
04:49:46.610 --> 04:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
of Delaware especially our young people
 
04:49:48.650 --> 04:49:48.660 align:start position:0%
questions about the long-term health and
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
economic impacts of marijuana use as
 
04:49:52.970 --> 04:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
well as serious law enforcement concerns
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
remain unsolved unresolved in addition
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
to this legalization ballot initiatives
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
initiatives were rejected this past
 
04:50:03.470 --> 04:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
November in South Dakota North Dakota
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
and Arkansas despite huge amounts of
 
04:50:08.628 --> 04:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
money spent on the pro-legalization by
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
the pro-legalization lobby
 
04:50:12.650 --> 04:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
and what does this all mean this means
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
that legalization comes with a
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
significant Public Health cost
 
04:50:18.410 --> 04:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
that all states should consider
 
04:50:18.420 --> 04:50:19.490 align:start position:0%
that all states should consider
carefully

04:50:19.490 --> 04:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
04:50:21.650 --> 04:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to conclude my testimony by
 
04:50:24.530 --> 04:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
just discussing HP 639's purpose and
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
finding section it stands in there in
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
the interest of allowing law enforcement
 
04:50:31.010 --> 04:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
to focus on violent and property crimes
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
generate revenue for Education
 
04:50:35.448 --> 04:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
preventment prevention treatment and
 
04:50:37.010 --> 04:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
Recovery related to the use of both
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%

enforcement here today if they think we
 
04:51:00.288 --> 04:51:00.298 align:start position:0%
need to legalize marijuana so they have
 
04:51:02.930 --> 04:51:02.940 align:start position:0%

introduction of legalized marijuana
 
04:51:31.970 --> 04:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
I respectfully asked and I also
 
04:51:34.010 --> 04:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that no one in this
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
legislature hide behind the banner of
 
04:51:38.208 --> 04:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
individual freedom
 
04:51:40.390 --> 04:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
when considering marijuana legalization
 
04:51:43.490 --> 04:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
especially since we all know everyone in
 
04:51:45.410 --> 04:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
this room that it's about money because
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's the main selling point
 
04:51:49.730 --> 04:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
the public deserves to have an honest
 
04:51:51.770 --> 04:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
discussion on this topic and we
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
and they deserve actually to to have the
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
public health aspect of this discuss
 
04:51:58.970 --> 04:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
just as much as we want to discuss the
 
04:51:58.980 --> 04:52:01.010 align:start position:0%
just as much as we want to discuss the
revenues

04:52:01.010 --> 04:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:52:03.410 --> 04:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
the public also deserves for this bill
 
04:52:04.850 --> 04:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
not to have been slipped quietly and
 
04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
quickly into the Commerce and consumer
 
04:52:08.690 --> 04:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
affairs committee instead the criminal
 
04:52:11.090 --> 04:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
justice committee it is noteworthy that
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
the Bill's sponsor I believe is a member
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
of this committee as well
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
lastly the public deserves each one of
 
04:52:18.890 --> 04:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
you to include my own rep Hollis rep
 
04:52:21.230 --> 04:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
Karen calabra who's not here today
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing for the health of
 
04:52:24.890 --> 04:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
Grant Staters because your decision on
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
this bill will have a direct impact on
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
us all thank you and thank you yes sir
 
04:52:33.530 --> 04:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has a question
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh chairman hunt
 
04:52:38.448 --> 04:52:38.458 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your information
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are concerned myself
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
included that
 
04:52:44.520 --> 04:52:45.230 align:start position:0%
included that
um

04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
being in an illegal act
 
04:52:51.230 --> 04:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh young men and women are
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
being thrown into jail
 
04:52:56.208 --> 04:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
and in effect their Futures compromised
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
because they
 
04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
smoke some weed
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I I was just wondering any of these
 
04:53:07.310 --> 04:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
states that have made it legal have they
 
04:53:10.010 --> 04:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
come up with any kind of well they don't
 
04:53:13.010 --> 04:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
arrest them anymore I guess but uh was
 
04:53:15.650 --> 04:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
there any effort to try and uh reinstate
 
04:53:18.770 --> 04:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
and make it uh you know putting kids in
 
04:53:22.250 --> 04:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
jail uh or is there an answer to some
 
04:53:25.368 --> 04:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
sort of compromise where uh
 
04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know either either your kid goes to
 
04:53:28.560 --> 04:53:29.330 align:start position:0%
you know either either your kid goes to
jail

04:53:29.330 --> 04:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
jail
 
04:53:31.490 --> 04:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
can't get a driver's license which takes
 
04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
five years to get
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
sure okay I mean I've seen that or uh uh
 
04:53:41.690 --> 04:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
smokes weed and and you go through a
 
04:53:43.850 --> 04:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
whole lot of medical issues which I'm
 
04:53:46.730 --> 04:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
aware of too I'm just wondering if
 
04:53:50.208 --> 04:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
there's is it just that bipolar is it
 
04:53:51.650 --> 04:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
just either or
 
04:53:53.868 --> 04:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
well as you're aware if States you know
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
make it legal then obviously
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know the numbers look great for
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
arrests because arrests go away but I I
 
04:54:02.690 --> 04:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
will say that it it's sort of a null uh
 
04:54:04.610 --> 04:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
Point here in New Hampshire because it
 
04:54:08.150 --> 04:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.810 --> 04:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if you have
 
04:54:13.368 --> 04:54:13.378 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire thank
 
04:54:15.360 --> 04:54:16.368 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire thank
you

04:54:16.368 --> 04:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:54:19.850 --> 04:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
um I was not aware of that uh and I'm
 
04:54:21.770 --> 04:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
getting old so
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
some of the information I have might be
 
04:54:27.910 --> 04:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
dated but but I know that uh
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
maybe it's too late for those kids but
 
04:54:34.550 --> 04:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh I know that they've had their lives
 
04:54:38.510 --> 04:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
severely damaged because of being
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
arrested and put in jail in some cases
 
04:54:43.368 --> 04:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
yes sir and that's a valid point and I
 
04:54:45.050 --> 04:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
will say though that you can add that to
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
any number of things kids do all kinds
 
04:54:49.010 --> 04:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
of stupid stuff you know I have four of
 
04:54:50.330 --> 04:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
them myself
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
um any number of things they could they
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
could vandalize something they could
 
04:54:56.510 --> 04:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
they could drive recklessly they could
 
04:54:58.010 --> 04:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
smoke pot they could do all number of
 
04:54:59.868 --> 04:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
things so your question I I appreciate
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
it but I do think that it could apply to
 
04:55:04.730 --> 04:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
a number of things that
 
04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
kids do in their youth
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:13.128 --> 04:55:13.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%

04:55:50.810 --> 04:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
chairman question so this is my opinion
 
04:55:52.368 --> 04:55:52.378 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know if it's yours also
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't you think right now that the black
 
04:55:56.208 --> 04:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
market and I'm not sure if you can
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
answer this question on one of the other
 
04:55:58.970 --> 04:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
speakers right now is running the
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
so-called pod operation in outside sales
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is other states are actually
 
04:56:08.650 --> 04:56:08.660 align:start position:0%
running it and they're doing it anyway
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
and and your your question sir is that
 
04:56:15.050 --> 04:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
the black market is running the pot
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
sales right now maybe putting even a
 
04:56:21.170 --> 04:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
greater risk on the people or the
 
04:56:23.270 --> 04:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
citizens the youth or whoever is using
 
04:56:26.090 --> 04:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
the state they're putting a greater risk
 
04:56:28.810 --> 04:56:28.820 align:start position:0%
um and I hear the so-called gateway drug
 
04:56:31.730 --> 04:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh and I just want to say that if you're
 
04:56:33.890 --> 04:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
going to a black market dealer who's
 
04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
selling pot
 
04:56:38.810 --> 04:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
and maybe they sell another drug that's
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
illegal such as coke or heroin wouldn't
 
04:56:44.690 --> 04:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
they be at greater risk than to buy it
 
04:56:46.850 --> 04:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
in a controlled environment
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
controlled by the state versus going to
 
04:56:51.530 --> 04:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
the black market
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
and risking
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
other type of illegal drug pushers or to
 
04:57:01.128 --> 04:57:01.138 align:start position:0%
the to the individual I understand what
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I would love to think
 
04:57:04.970 --> 04:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
that if legalization happened that
 
04:57:06.590 --> 04:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
nobody would go to a black market but
 
04:57:08.448 --> 04:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
Colorado's data shows us that that that
 
04:57:11.628 --> 04:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't happen I mean it just
 
04:57:13.070 --> 04:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't the black Market's always going
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
to beat your price
 
04:57:16.368 --> 04:57:16.378 align:start position:0%
they're always going to beat your price
 
04:57:19.490 --> 04:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
you put any amount of tax on this and
 
04:57:20.930 --> 04:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
they're going to beat your price it's
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
not going to I mean it's just a function
 
04:57:25.250 --> 04:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
of fact so that's proven out in in every
 
04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
state that's been doing this so I I
 
04:57:28.368 --> 04:57:28.378 align:start position:0%
would love to do anything to keep kids
 
04:57:30.530 --> 04:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
away from the black market but but
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
legalizing doesn't solve that problem
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I wish it did but it doesn't
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and I will know that I actually work
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Oklahoma Emergency
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
Management I work remotely for them and
 
04:57:44.448 --> 04:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
they've had an issue with marijuana
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
because they legalized it medically and
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of farmland and they
 
04:57:50.448 --> 04:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
didn't put any limits on how much you
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
can grow in Oklahoma right now is the
 
04:57:55.010 --> 04:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
number one state for
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
um supply for the illegal black market
 
04:57:59.690 --> 04:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
and not only are they number one uh
 
04:58:02.090 --> 04:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
supply for this they actually have
 
04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
overnight in Oklahoma introduced
 
04:58:09.530 --> 04:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
Russian Mexican and Chinese cartels uh
 
04:58:12.530 --> 04:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
into into their farmlands and the way
 
04:58:14.448 --> 04:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
that they're legally laundering money is
 
04:58:16.128 --> 04:58:16.138 align:start position:0%
they're they're reselling the Farms
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
every couple months or so they're just
 
04:58:20.208 --> 04:58:20.218 align:start position:0%
washing their profits it's a legal way
 
04:58:21.770 --> 04:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
to wash their profits it's a it's a
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
shame and a crime what's happening in
 
04:58:25.010 --> 04:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma I talked to emergency managers
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
on an everyday basis and uh they tell me
 
04:58:30.410 --> 04:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
about what's going on in their
 
04:58:32.448 --> 04:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
communities so I wish that the black
 
04:58:34.910 --> 04:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
market wasn't always one step ahead but
 
04:58:35.930 --> 04:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:58:38.090 --> 04:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir representative
 
04:58:38.100 --> 04:58:40.128 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir representative
Burroughs

04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
Burroughs
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:58:41.760 --> 04:58:43.070 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
um it's a two-part question and it kind
 
04:58:47.090 --> 04:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
of goes along with what Representative
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
Vincent was saying
 
04:58:50.810 --> 04:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
um in Colorado you talked about the
 
04:58:52.430 --> 04:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
increased rate of people going to the
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
emergency room from marijuana do you
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
know what percentage of those were from
 
04:58:58.128 --> 04:58:58.138 align:start position:0%
the black market because they weren't
 
04:58:58.138 --> 04:58:59.510 align:start position:0%
the black market because they weren't
controlled

04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
no ma'am okay that's not it that's not
 
04:59:04.368 --> 04:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
data that that the Colorado hospitals
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay collect and my second question
 
04:59:08.690 --> 04:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire thank
 
04:59:10.850 --> 04:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair my second question is I
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
think you may not have this data but I'm
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if we might be interesting to
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
find out what's the rate for ER visits
 
04:59:19.550 --> 04:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of alcohol and opioid use
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
relative to marijuana I don't know but I
 
04:59:25.970 --> 04:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
I do know that um I know sometimes in a
 
04:59:27.410 --> 04:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
lot of these discussions we try to make
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
these equivalencies to alcohol
 
04:59:32.448 --> 04:59:32.458 align:start position:0%
and I would actually just caution you
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
that making an equivalency to alcohol
 
04:59:36.470 --> 04:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't negate your responsibilities to
 
04:59:38.270 --> 04:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
deciding marijuana on its own health
 
04:59:38.280 --> 04:59:39.650 align:start position:0%
deciding marijuana on its own health
impacts

04:59:39.650 --> 04:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
04:59:42.770 --> 04:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative Yemen
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and good to see you
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
nice to see The Honorable
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
I just have a question you were talking
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
about the black market there's a reality
 
04:59:59.330 --> 04:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
in our state with the white Market in
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding states
 
05:00:04.270 --> 05:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
so if you pay attention
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
for instance about a mile south of the
 
05:00:12.350 --> 05:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester of the mall in Nashua
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
um there's a marijuana shop and there's
 
05:00:16.730 --> 05:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
a steady stream of New Hampshire license
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
plates in and out of that shop all day
 
05:00:21.948 --> 05:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
long so that's not a hypothetical with
 
05:00:23.930 --> 05:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
the black market that's a reality with
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
the white Market what would you what
 
05:00:28.190 --> 05:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that we do with that
 
05:00:30.650 --> 05:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
border should we have the police stop
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
people and and search their vehicles
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
because they're coming back across the
 
05:00:36.770 --> 05:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
border with uh how do we handle that
 
05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
situation if we keep New Hampshire a
 
05:00:40.550 --> 05:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
Prohibition state
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
well I understand that it's a you know
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
and to to speak to your to answer your
 
05:00:49.680 --> 05:00:51.170 align:start position:0%
and to to speak to your to answer your
question

05:00:51.170 --> 05:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:00:51.180 --> 05:00:51.890 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:00:51.890 --> 05:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know how to to do
 
05:00:55.970 --> 05:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
that I just know that when states
 
05:00:55.980 --> 05:00:57.288 align:start position:0%
that I just know that when states
legalize

05:00:57.288 --> 05:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
legalize
 
05:00:59.570 --> 05:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
it tends to give the green light to
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
their youth
 
05:01:03.470 --> 05:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
that increased use is okay
 
05:01:06.530 --> 05:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
and the health impacts of those are
 
05:01:06.540 --> 05:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
and the health impacts of those are
significant

05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
significant
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
so I know that it's it's somewhat of a a
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
mixed bag saying well we're not going to
 
05:01:14.090 --> 05:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
legalize in this little island of New
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we're all surrounded
 
05:01:19.010 --> 05:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
but I'm just going off the science I'm
 
05:01:20.570 --> 05:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
just going off to science and just doing
 
05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
my best
 
05:01:25.128 --> 05:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier I have four kids
 
05:01:27.890 --> 05:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
all I've done their whole lives is just
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
held back crazy
 
05:01:32.448 --> 05:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
and I that's all I'm trying to do here
 
05:01:32.458 --> 05:01:35.208 align:start position:0%
and I that's all I'm trying to do here
today

05:01:35.208 --> 05:01:35.218 align:start position:0%

05:02:12.298 --> 05:02:13.010 align:start position:0%
as a chair of the state's leading trade
group

05:02:13.010 --> 05:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:02:14.570 --> 05:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
for the campus industry and we're
 
05:02:16.490 --> 05:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
pleased to support House Bill 639 which
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
is a bipartisan leadership effort of
 
05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
Representative Osborne representative
 
05:02:21.170 --> 05:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm which will move New Hampshire
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
into the realistic world of adult use
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization and regulation of
 
05:02:27.770 --> 05:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis is essential to New Hampshire
 
05:02:30.530 --> 05:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
in a variety of ways we're losing
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue due to our current Antiquated
 
05:02:34.550 --> 05:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
laws with legal adult use cannabis now
 
05:02:37.610 --> 05:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
available in Massachusetts Vermont and
 
05:02:39.050 --> 05:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
Maine we are seeing New Hampshire
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
consumers leaving to spend their money
 
05:02:43.610 --> 05:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
elsewhere the average states are finding
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
economic success with cannabis in 2013
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
in 2023 Vermont is projected to find 15
 
05:02:51.288 --> 05:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
to 20 million dollars in their first
 
05:02:55.730 --> 05:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
year Maine in 2022 found 58.5 million
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
dollars in sales revenue and 65 million
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
dollars from direct and indirect
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
spending by businesses and employees
 
05:03:04.550 --> 05:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
associated with the industry and
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts grossed three billion
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
dollars in the last four years from 2018
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
to 2022 so it's easy to see why League
 
05:03:14.930 --> 05:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
legalization and regulation of cannabis
 
05:03:17.090 --> 05:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
is good for our state's economy but
 
05:03:18.770 --> 05:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
that's not the only reason I'm here to
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
talk with you today
 
05:03:22.490 --> 05:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can reclaim and share in
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
this new Revenue generation generating
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
industry by
 
05:03:28.550 --> 05:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
approved by and endorsed by almost 80
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
percent of our residents
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
and it's an industry that is focused on
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
young people in a state where we are not
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
attracting young people
 
05:03:38.690 --> 05:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
not just folks that are interested in
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
enjoying their cannabis but those that
 
05:03:41.750 --> 05:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
want to work in the industry in
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture in retail in
 
05:03:48.410 --> 05:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
creation of Edibles so it's a job
 
05:03:48.420 --> 05:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
creation of Edibles so it's a job
creator

05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
creator
 
05:03:51.650 --> 05:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
and we're also seeing an industry that
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
is built on small business entrepreneurs
 
05:03:56.570 --> 05:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
and agriculture an industry that is
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
poised for growth but is being stifled
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
an important part of this legislation is
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that it will allow small
 
05:04:06.288 --> 05:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
businesses Private Industry to be
 
05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
developed here in the state we pride
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
ourselves as being a pro-business state
 
05:04:11.810 --> 05:04:11.820 align:start position:0%
a small business State and that's an
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
important part of this legislation
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
we can't ignore that this bill was
 
05:04:15.840 --> 05:04:17.510 align:start position:0%
we can't ignore that this bill was
designed

05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
designed
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
by a bipartisan Coalition looking at
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
Best Practices from a variety of states
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
and creating a bill that is best for New
 
05:04:24.958 --> 05:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
and creating a bill that is best for New
Hampshire

05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:04:27.948 --> 05:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
and speaking of best practices data from
 
05:04:30.350 --> 05:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
the National Youth risk behavior survey
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
says that every every state that has
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
regulated legal cannabis has seen
 
05:04:39.470 --> 05:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in underage use
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
the aforementioned illicit or black
 
05:04:41.520 --> 05:04:42.530 align:start position:0%
the aforementioned illicit or black
market

05:04:42.530 --> 05:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
market
 
05:04:45.530 --> 05:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
right now if a young person wants to get
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis in New Hampshire they can we
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're getting what's
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
its potency how it was grown a regulated
 
05:04:56.448 --> 05:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
market will allow independent testing of
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
cannabis grown in our state we'll be
 
05:05:01.550 --> 05:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
able to understand what potency levels
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
people can get access to now you can go
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
into a New Hampshire state liquor store
 
05:05:07.550 --> 05:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
and say I'd like 70 proof vodka or 100
 
05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
Proof vodka without regulation we are
 
05:05:13.128 --> 05:05:13.138 align:start position:0%
not able to do that with canvas
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's an important part of this
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is independent testing and
 
05:05:20.330 --> 05:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
Regulation and control so that we're
 
05:05:20.340 --> 05:05:21.410 align:start position:0%
Regulation and control so that we're
protecting

05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
our young people and we're protecting
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
our adults who make a decision to enjoy
 
05:05:25.620 --> 05:05:27.110 align:start position:0%
our adults who make a decision to enjoy
that

05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
lastly an important part of our state's
 
05:05:32.810 --> 05:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
economy is tourism people are now
 
05:05:34.128 --> 05:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
beginning to make their tourism
 
05:05:36.050 --> 05:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
decisions based on what they can get
 
05:05:38.570 --> 05:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
access to I live in the North Country in
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill between two ski mountains and
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
many times residents have told me oh
 
05:05:46.250 --> 05:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
I've driven over to Maine and I'll go to
 
05:05:48.170 --> 05:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
a cannabis shop in Maine and I'll go
 
05:05:49.850 --> 05:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
skiing there first and then I'll buy my
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
groceries and other things and then
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll come to New Hampshire for a
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
night or two so if tourism is a major
 
05:05:59.930 --> 05:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
impact of our economy this could
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
potentially affect that
 
05:06:04.850 --> 05:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
so it's time for New Hampshire to pass
 
05:06:07.368 --> 05:06:07.378 align:start position:0%
intelligent legislation like House Bill
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
639 and I appreciate your time and I'm
 
05:06:13.250 --> 05:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative has a question if you're
 
05:06:18.110 --> 05:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
05:06:19.680 --> 05:06:20.690 align:start position:0%

testimony
um

05:06:21.530 --> 05:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:24.410 --> 05:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony uh this is I'm
 
05:06:26.208 --> 05:06:26.218 align:start position:0%
asking you a question about the Advisory
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
Board it sounds like you might be
 
05:06:28.850 --> 05:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
familiar with that feature of the bill
 
05:06:31.490 --> 05:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis Advisory Board it's on page
 
05:06:35.810 --> 05:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
10 line 29 of the bill could you give us
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
a little more detail on that Advisory
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
board if you're if you're familiar with
 
05:06:39.840 --> 05:06:40.930 align:start position:0%
board if you're if you're familiar with
it

05:06:40.930 --> 05:06:40.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:06:40.940 --> 05:06:42.590 align:start position:0%
it
yes

05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:06:46.010 --> 05:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
um as most pieces of legislation I I've
 
05:06:48.288 --> 05:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
experienced in my past as a member of
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
your house that it will go through a
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
variety of changes so proposed is the
 
05:06:53.930 --> 05:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
idea to build an Advisory Board of
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
professionals who have experience in the
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry have experience in
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
understanding about the impacts of
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis to be respectful to those who
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
are concerned about its use or overuse
 
05:07:10.250 --> 05:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
or potency but by building an Advisory
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
Board similar to the state of Vermont or
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine where those folks can
 
05:07:18.530 --> 05:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
then suggest Commissioners to the
 
05:07:19.970 --> 05:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
executive Council
 
05:07:22.610 --> 05:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's an important part of this being
 
05:07:24.650 --> 05:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
able to build a series of professionals
 
05:07:26.448 --> 05:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
that have experience from all walks of
 
05:07:26.458 --> 05:07:27.230 align:start position:0%
that have experience from all walks of
life

05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
within the Cannabis industry so that
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
we're bringing the best professionals
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
forward to oversee the industry again
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
the idea that we are looking at Best
 
05:07:39.530 --> 05:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
Practices from around now over half the
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
nation having states with legal adult
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
use cannabis and being able to be sort
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
of in the uh
 
05:07:48.890 --> 05:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
positive position to look at
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
what ways are best to build in a
 
05:07:53.930 --> 05:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
commission or an Advisory board that can
 
05:07:56.390 --> 05:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
bring professionals that can make this a
 
05:07:56.400 --> 05:07:57.470 align:start position:0%
bring professionals that can make this a
smart

05:07:57.470 --> 05:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
smart
 
05:07:57.480 --> 05:07:59.690 align:start position:0%
smart
uh

05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:02.030 --> 05:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
agency that oversees
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Terry
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you do I understand that you're
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
currently a member of the Cannabis
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board sir
 
05:08:15.070 --> 05:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
are you currently a member of the county
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
I'm currently the chair you're currently
 
05:08:20.030 --> 05:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
the chair so certainly you're a member
 
05:08:22.850 --> 05:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
then yes and you're the chair yes so uh
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
what I've heard from you thus far
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
primarily what you consider to be the
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
economic benefits
 
05:08:32.690 --> 05:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
of uh of this bill we you have been
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
present to hear the testimony of the
 
05:08:37.368 --> 05:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
previous speaker with respect to adverse
 
05:08:39.890 --> 05:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
Health consequences in the states that
 
05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
have uh that have legalized
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
um how would you respond to what you
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
have heard the documented evidence with
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
respect to massive uh adverse Health
 
05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
consequences in these states that have
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
legalized you and the members of the
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
board or if you've not addressed that
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
yet as as a board what would be your
 
05:09:00.110 --> 05:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
personal uh feelings about this
 
05:09:01.970 --> 05:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
well I think I'd be interested to see
 
05:09:03.770 --> 05:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
the research that came out of Colorado I
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
work closely with the Cannabis
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
certification Council which is a
 
05:09:07.850 --> 05:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
colorado-based organization working
 
05:09:09.410 --> 05:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
closely with the California with the
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
Colorado Department of Public Health and
 
05:09:14.810 --> 05:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
so I'd be concerned at the quote number
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
of emergency room visits and whether we
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
can discern whether that was from legal
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't use cannabis or whether that was
 
05:09:22.670 --> 05:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
from Black Market cannabis
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I'd be interested to see that data
 
05:09:26.390 --> 05:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
and see where the proof is there I think
 
05:09:29.868 --> 05:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
secondarily you know while in this bill
 
05:09:32.090 --> 05:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's some specifics
 
05:09:34.128 --> 05:09:34.138 align:start position:0%
around potency that usually become sort
 
05:09:36.770 --> 05:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
of an agency decision once an agency is
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
created like we do here in New Hampshire
 
05:09:40.490 --> 05:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
agencies have some rule-making ability
 
05:09:44.208 --> 05:09:44.218 align:start position:0%
but I do think Colorado initially had
 
05:09:48.650 --> 05:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
some very wide open potency levels and
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
that is something that should be
 
05:09:53.208 --> 05:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
addressed and making sure that when we
 
05:09:55.368 --> 05:09:55.378 align:start position:0%
are creating products we're concerned
 
05:09:59.570 --> 05:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:01.850 --> 05:10:01.860 align:start position:0%

my written testimony is replete with a
 
05:10:55.730 --> 05:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
lot of facts and information that's
 
05:10:57.708 --> 05:10:57.718 align:start position:0%
already been discussed and I'm not going
 
05:11:00.590 --> 05:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
to cover that same ground again
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
when this debate really started to heat
 
05:11:06.650 --> 05:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
up here and in other places
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
we used to say that well the jury's not
 
05:11:11.810 --> 05:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
in with respect to the effects of
 
05:11:13.850 --> 05:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis in the United
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%

legalization of cannabis and the

commercialization of cannabis is

creating a public health hazard is
 
05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
harmful to both adults as well as our
 
05:11:41.208 --> 05:11:41.218 align:start position:0%
young people and in the Next Generation
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
here in the United States it's caused
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
increased tragedy and Chaos on our
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%

were up 51 percent
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
uh that's on top of 120 increase since
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
the legalization of marijuana in

prepares and consumer affairs and
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
protection is that the legalization of

cannabis has been proven by a number of
 
05:12:25.080 --> 05:12:26.350 align:start position:0%
cannabis has been proven by a number of
studies

05:12:26.350 --> 05:12:26.360 align:start position:0%

across the globe that have proven that
 
05:12:38.208 --> 05:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
legalization commercialization of
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
cannabis provides significant creates
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
significant public health risks for
 
05:12:44.868 --> 05:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
adults and particularly youth you heard
 
05:12:46.970 --> 05:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
testimony you're ready with respect to
 
05:12:49.730 --> 05:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
marijuana being one of the primary drugs
 
05:12:52.850 --> 05:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
involved in completed teen suicides in
 
05:12:55.128 --> 05:12:55.138 align:start position:0%
the state of Colorado just the other day
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
you saw an article in our own Manchester
 
05:13:02.090 --> 05:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
Union leader that talked about the risk
 
05:13:04.030 --> 05:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
of edibles
 
05:13:07.250 --> 05:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
particularly causing a public health
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
hazard in Risk in that article it
 
05:13:12.050 --> 05:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
indicated that 62 people last year were
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
treated in medical facilities in New
 
05:13:15.070 --> 05:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone
 
05:13:15.080 --> 05:13:17.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone
for

05:13:17.230 --> 05:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
consumption of cannabis and then on top
 
05:13:24.770 --> 05:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
of that 19 of that 62 were children
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
under the at the age of six or under
 
05:13:31.368 --> 05:13:31.378 align:start position:0%
let me repeat that 19 of those 62 people
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
that were treated
 
05:13:36.410 --> 05:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire hospitals with respect
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
to cannabis poisoning were at the age of
 
05:13:41.868 --> 05:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
six or under just this past week in
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
Bedford my own officers responded to a
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
case involving two juveniles both had to
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
be transported to a medical facility
 
05:13:53.090 --> 05:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
regarding with as a result of consuming
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis edibles
 
05:13:58.670 --> 05:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
you have a 49-page bill before you
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language in there
 
05:14:04.490 --> 05:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
but all the Chiefs will tell you that no
 
05:14:06.770 --> 05:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
amount of Regulation no amount of
 
05:14:09.170 --> 05:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
language is going to change the
 
05:14:12.050 --> 05:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
undeniable fact that legalization and
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
commercialization of cannabis will
 
05:14:17.628 --> 05:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
undeniably increase the prevalence and
 
05:14:20.330 --> 05:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
use use of cannabis by our youth in the
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire it will result in
 
05:14:25.330 --> 05:14:25.340 align:start position:0%
Greater Public Health harm to adults
 
05:14:29.810 --> 05:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
it'll create a cause as indicated in the
 
05:14:32.448 --> 05:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
written testimony of some 80 million
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in direct and indirect
 
05:14:38.030 --> 05:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
Clause you can make money but is this
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
really about money we believe in the
 
05:14:44.030 --> 05:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
Chiefs Association that legalization and
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
commercialization of cannabis is more
 
05:14:48.170 --> 05:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
about public safety and public health
 
05:14:50.990 --> 05:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
than it should be about money it's the

05:15:24.288 --> 05:15:24.298 align:start position:0%
you know one of our own was killed in
 
05:15:26.208 --> 05:15:26.218 align:start position:0%
connection with a crash that may have
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
involved cannabis use in connection with
 
05:15:31.970 --> 05:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
that fatal crash and in Bedford alone I
 
05:15:35.150 --> 05:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
can tell you that in 2019 we handled two
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
fatal accidents both of those incidents
 
05:15:40.368 --> 05:15:40.378 align:start position:0%
involved marijuana impaired drivers and
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
our officers had to make those calls to
 
05:15:46.250 --> 05:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
those affected families telling them
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
that their loved ones wouldn't be homes
 
05:15:50.330 --> 05:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill that
 
05:15:53.930 --> 05:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
creates a per se limit that would allow
 
05:15:56.090 --> 05:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement to be able
 
05:15:59.208 --> 05:15:59.218 align:start position:0%
to determine that someone is impaired by
 
05:16:02.330 --> 05:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
marijuana or cannabis uh the two crashes
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
that the Bedford Police Department
 
05:16:08.930 --> 05:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
investigated in 2019 did not result in
 
05:16:10.730 --> 05:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
charges with respect to impaired
 
05:16:13.970 --> 05:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
marijuana driving as a result of the Gap
 
05:16:16.128 --> 05:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
in the law here in the state of New
 
05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's nothing in this
 
05:16:21.770 --> 05:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
bill that will create an opportunity for
 
05:16:23.448 --> 05:16:23.458 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to be able to protect
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
you and your families from marijuana
 
05:16:27.530 --> 05:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
impaired drivers
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
the black market which is something that
 
05:16:31.610 --> 05:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
I've heard about in previous testimony
 
05:16:34.910 --> 05:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
has undeniably proliferated in every
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
state every state that's legalized
 
05:16:39.490 --> 05:16:39.500 align:start position:0%
marijuana in fact the state of Oregon
 
05:16:42.470 --> 05:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
appropriated more than 25 million
 
05:16:45.410 --> 05:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
dollars in the past year to address the
 
05:16:47.590 --> 05:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
black market that's proliferated
 
05:16:49.850 --> 05:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
proliferated in the state of Oregon
 
05:16:49.860 --> 05:16:51.910 align:start position:0%
proliferated in the state of Oregon
sorry

05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:16:56.990 --> 05:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know the black marketeers and those
 
05:16:59.390 --> 05:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
folks who grow marijuana for profit that
 
05:17:02.570 --> 05:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
are not part of a legalized Society they
 
05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
don't pay withholding tax they will
 
05:17:07.070 --> 05:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
always be able to undercut and undersell
 
05:17:09.010 --> 05:17:09.020 align:start position:0%
every legalized
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
industry in the state of in the United
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
States and they have continued to do
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
that and they will continue to do that
 
05:17:18.110 --> 05:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
because for them it makes a lot of money
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
they can understand undercut recent
 
05:17:22.368 --> 05:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe articles certainly
 
05:17:25.490 --> 05:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
indicated that the marijuana industry in
 
05:17:27.050 --> 05:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is suffering there was a
 
05:17:29.208 --> 05:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
recent article a month or so ago they
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
indicated that Colorado was expecting a
 
05:17:33.948 --> 05:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
100 million dollar shortfall and
 
05:17:35.810 --> 05:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
expecting massive layoffs in the
 
05:17:37.610 --> 05:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
marijuana cannabis industry in Colorado
 
05:17:40.368 --> 05:17:40.378 align:start position:0%
and of course you've read about the
 
05:17:42.410 --> 05:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
significant problems in chaos in
 
05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma and California
 
05:17:46.970 --> 05:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
at the end of this I'll I'll have to say
 
05:17:46.980 --> 05:17:48.350 align:start position:0%
at the end of this I'll I'll have to say
this

05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
we in the United States were Bamboozled
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
by the tobacco industry and we're still
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
paying for that
 
05:17:56.690 --> 05:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
we were recently Bamboozled by the
 
05:17:58.430 --> 05:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry with respect to
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
opioid painkillers and we are paying for
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
that dearly and the question now is are
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
we going to be Bamboozled by the
 
05:18:07.970 --> 05:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
marijuana industry that's a decision
 
05:18:10.368 --> 05:18:10.378 align:start position:0%
that you all have to make but it's the
 
05:18:12.288 --> 05:18:12.298 align:start position:0%
men and women of law enforcement that'll
 
05:18:14.810 --> 05:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
have to pick up the pieces after this is
 
05:18:18.170 --> 05:18:18.180 align:start position:0%
all done thank you for listening
 
05:18:20.410 --> 05:18:20.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:18:22.490 --> 05:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative petusic you have a
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh chief
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
05:18:32.690 --> 05:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
is there any methodology available today
 
05:18:34.990 --> 05:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
to test for
 
05:18:39.050 --> 05:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
marijuana in a DUI situation where
 
05:18:40.610 --> 05:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
somebody gets stopped from being under
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
the influence
 
05:18:43.850 --> 05:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
no there is not there is no roadside
 
05:18:47.208 --> 05:18:47.218 align:start position:0%
test that's available there's been a
 
05:18:50.448 --> 05:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
number of experimentations with roadside
 
05:18:53.628 --> 05:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
testing both in Canada Canada and the
 
05:18:56.810 --> 05:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
United States but none of that research
 
05:19:00.170 --> 05:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
has proved a reliable test the
 
05:19:01.868 --> 05:19:01.878 align:start position:0%
additional problem
 
05:19:04.730 --> 05:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
representative is that in looking at the
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
research and studies done in Ohio by a
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
research institute there
 
05:19:13.070 --> 05:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
the use chronic use of cannabis has
 
05:19:15.288 --> 05:19:15.298 align:start position:0%
lingering effects well after the
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
individual has stopped using marijuana
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
so it's not simply just using and
 
05:19:23.448 --> 05:19:23.458 align:start position:0%
applying the same methodology as alcohol
 
05:19:26.330 --> 05:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lingering effect that they
 
05:19:28.550 --> 05:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
have detected and that's again that's
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
solid research done by one of the
 
05:19:35.690 --> 05:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:38.570 --> 05:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh I have a question
 
05:19:40.490 --> 05:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:19:43.368 --> 05:19:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:19:45.650 --> 05:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
feedbacking off of that question do you
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
know or do you have any data uh maybe
 
05:19:49.368 --> 05:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
somebody else will later on on whether
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
or not there is actually an increase
 
05:19:54.050 --> 05:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
traffic fatality rate since these
 
05:19:56.090 --> 05:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
legalizations have occurred
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I'd be curious to know whether or not
 
05:19:59.208 --> 05:19:59.218 align:start position:0%
people have substituted away from
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol and into marijuana if that's
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
occurring perhaps that's changing uh the
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
fatality rates also I'd be curious to
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
know if there's just been a spike in
 
05:20:12.590 --> 05:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
accidents that are involved in marijuana
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
and so that we're seeing higher rates of
 
05:20:16.490 --> 05:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
accidents higher rates of deaths overall
 
05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
because presumably if it's as dangerous
 
05:20:20.690 --> 05:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
as it potentially could be and there's
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
all these more people using it and
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
driving and there's no way to test for
 
05:20:25.490 --> 05:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
it there should be some sort of evidence
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
of of increased traffic fatality rates
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:32.030 --> 05:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
well if I understand the question right
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
it relates to an increased
 
05:20:37.250 --> 05:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
um trafficking did you say
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
no uh I'm I'm trying to understand if
 
05:20:43.208 --> 05:20:43.218 align:start position:0%
there's any data to show that traffic
 
05:20:46.730 --> 05:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
fatalities have increased across the
 
05:20:48.410 --> 05:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
board in these states that have
 
05:20:49.930 --> 05:20:49.940 align:start position:0%
legalized versus the ones that haven't
 
05:20:53.530 --> 05:20:53.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely there is substantial data
 
05:20:56.810 --> 05:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
both in Colorado there's substantial
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
data in the state of Washington there's
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
substantial data in Canada particularly
 
05:21:02.120 --> 05:21:03.788 align:start position:0%
substantial data in Canada particularly
the

05:21:03.788 --> 05:21:03.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:07.128 --> 05:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
province of Quebec that Associates
 
05:21:10.150 --> 05:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
legalization with increased fatalities
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
involving marijuana so there's a and in
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
addition to that when looking at the
 
05:21:19.610 --> 05:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
fatalities and the counties surrounding
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized that have not
 
05:21:24.708 --> 05:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
legalized marijuana you'll see an
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
increase in marijuana related crashes
 
05:21:29.948 --> 05:21:29.958 align:start position:0%
and fatalities as well
 
05:21:33.708 --> 05:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
I'll have to say that you know while we
 
05:21:35.810 --> 05:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
may be surrounded by states that have
 
05:21:38.270 --> 05:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
legalized that doesn't necessarily mean
 
05:21:40.850 --> 05:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
that the great Granite State who Finds
 
05:21:42.970 --> 05:21:42.980 align:start position:0%
Its Own Way in most every incidence
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
should follow us like a bunch of
 
05:21:48.590 --> 05:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
lemmings across the cliff simply in the
 
05:21:51.770 --> 05:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
pursuit of dollars I think that when you
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
look at the fiscal notes of this bill
 
05:21:56.150 --> 05:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see that your own administrative
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
Services folks cannot give anyone a
 
05:22:02.650 --> 05:22:02.660 align:start position:0%
reliable figure about how much revenue
 
05:22:05.930 --> 05:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
that this is going to create and in
 
05:22:07.850 --> 05:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
addition to that there is certainly no
 
05:22:09.948 --> 05:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
one that's going to be able to tell you
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
what the public health costs and the law
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement costs associated with this
 
05:22:18.110 --> 05:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of one motor vehicle
 
05:22:21.288 --> 05:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
fatality that would not have occurred
 
05:22:25.850 --> 05:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
had cannabis not been legalized there is
 
05:22:29.150 --> 05:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
no cost that we can put on a human life
 
05:22:32.810 --> 05:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
chief for your testimony what has been
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
the increase in traffic accidents in New
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since all of our neighboring
 
05:22:43.128 --> 05:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
states have legalized cannabis
 
05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
would you repeat that question against
 
05:22:47.330 --> 05:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
what has been the increase in traffic
 
05:22:49.970 --> 05:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
accidents in New Hampshire since all of
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states have legalized
 
05:22:51.840 --> 05:22:53.810 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states have legalized
cannabis

05:22:53.810 --> 05:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
05:22:56.030 --> 05:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about that data we we're
 
05:22:58.128 --> 05:22:58.138 align:start position:0%
struggling a bit to try to get reliable
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
data here in New Hampshire with respect
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
to marijuana impaired crashes
 
05:23:04.850 --> 05:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you that again the
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
data that we have
 
05:23:09.350 --> 05:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
um again Vermont has only been two years
 
05:23:11.090 --> 05:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
Maine has only been a couple of years in
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has been I think less than
 
05:23:15.890 --> 05:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
five or six years whereas Colorado we're
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
talking about more than 10 12 years of
 
05:23:20.510 --> 05:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
data Washington State more than 10 12
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
Years a data so again that data that has
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
been out there with respect to the
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
crashes in those States is undeniable
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
that crashes do increase we we can
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
extrapolate using Colorado data to see
 
05:23:36.590 --> 05:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
that there would be another 50 or so
 
05:23:39.890 --> 05:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
marijuana involved fatal crashes in the
 
05:23:42.288 --> 05:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire if we if cannabis
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
is legalized here that's based on what
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
the percentage increase was in other
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
states it's had just about a decade of
 
05:23:49.138 --> 05:23:51.890 align:start position:0%
states it's had just about a decade of
legalization

05:23:51.890 --> 05:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
oh boy okay Representative Vincent
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:23:59.448 --> 05:23:59.458 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I just want to
 
05:24:02.030 --> 05:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
state that I respect you wholeheartedly
 
05:24:04.128 --> 05:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a opinion on either
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
side I just want to be able to ask some
 
05:24:08.690 --> 05:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
of the questions for both sides
 
05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that having a
 
05:24:12.650 --> 05:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
controlled environment as having
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
marijuana Outlets so to speak in the
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
05:24:20.530 --> 05:24:20.540 align:start position:0%
is I guess my question is is
 
05:24:22.730 --> 05:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
same question I heard it before right
 
05:24:28.730 --> 05:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
all to our surrounding states and get
 
05:24:34.190 --> 05:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
it how much more of an increase what
 
05:24:36.170 --> 05:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
people aren't doing it because it's
 
05:24:36.180 --> 05:24:38.750 align:start position:0%
people aren't doing it because it's
illegal

05:24:38.750 --> 05:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
well let me turn that question on this
 
05:24:42.890 --> 05:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
Edge and tell you that if you legalize
 
05:24:45.350 --> 05:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
it you will certainly undeniably have
 
05:24:46.970 --> 05:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
increased use
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
let me tell you that undeniably black
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
market for marijuana in the state of New
 
05:24:54.770 --> 05:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will not evaporate it will not
 
05:24:55.868 --> 05:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
go away
 
05:24:58.610 --> 05:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
people that grow marijuana illegally
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
will come here once it's legalized and
 
05:25:03.050 --> 05:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
take advantage of legalization as they
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
have in every other state right which
 
05:25:07.550 --> 05:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
puts an increased burden on New
 
05:25:09.050 --> 05:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and law enforcement that
 
05:25:10.670 --> 05:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
frankly ladies and gentlemen we don't
 
05:25:12.708 --> 05:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to deal with we don't
 
05:25:14.208 --> 05:25:14.218 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to deal with what we
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
have today let alone another 50 fatal
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
crashes in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
attributable to marijuana that's not
 
05:25:23.330 --> 05:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
something that we can sustain and and
 
05:25:25.368 --> 05:25:25.378 align:start position:0%
the cost of that is just something that
 
05:25:27.530 --> 05:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
we can can't sustain in terms of human
 
05:25:27.540 --> 05:25:28.970 align:start position:0%
we can can't sustain in terms of human
tragedy

05:25:28.970 --> 05:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
tragedy
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you chief
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
05:25:35.690 --> 05:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:25:37.850 --> 05:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
my question you're talking about
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um all these crashes throughout the U.S
 
05:25:42.350 --> 05:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me how many of these
 
05:25:44.448 --> 05:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
crashes involved
 
05:25:49.550 --> 05:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.230 --> 05:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
how many crashes involved in what again
 
05:25:51.240 --> 05:25:53.150 align:start position:0%
how many crashes involved in what again
liquor

05:25:53.150 --> 05:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
05:25:53.160 --> 05:25:55.390 align:start position:0%
liquor
alcohol

05:25:55.390 --> 05:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
05:25:58.128 --> 05:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
and marijuana I don't have the numbers
 
05:26:00.288 --> 05:26:00.298 align:start position:0%
for alcohol I'm sure that there is an
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
ample number of crashes that involve
 
05:26:06.288 --> 05:26:06.298 align:start position:0%
alcohol but again as in response to your
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
colleagues question
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
increasing or legalizing cannabis and
 
05:26:13.788 --> 05:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
commercializing it will undeniably
 
05:26:16.128 --> 05:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
increase the number of those accidents
 
05:26:19.010 --> 05:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
it will undeniably increase the number
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
of traffic fatalities attributed to
 
05:26:22.430 --> 05:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana that's a fact that's
 
05:26:24.830 --> 05:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
undeniable you can check the data all
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
across these other states that's what's
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
going to happen here yeah just a further
 
05:26:32.330 --> 05:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
question may inquire clarification
 
05:26:32.340 --> 05:26:33.070 align:start position:0%
question may inquire clarification
um

05:26:33.070 --> 05:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:35.690 --> 05:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
so are you telling me that all the
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
crashes that you're talking about were
 
05:26:40.190 --> 05:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
just marijuana people that were on
 
05:26:43.490 --> 05:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
marijuana or marijuana and alcohol
 
05:26:45.770 --> 05:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
no these are crashes that were
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
attributed to marijuana impaired drivers
 
05:26:52.368 --> 05:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
that's where the data comes from
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
05:26:56.448 --> 05:26:56.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for coming
 
05:26:58.250 --> 05:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
and testifying
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
um and looking over the handout that you
 
05:27:03.410 --> 05:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
gave us I just had a question about one
 
05:27:05.750 --> 05:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the charts is that okay
 
05:27:07.788 --> 05:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
I saw on page eight at the top
 
05:27:10.128 --> 05:27:10.138 align:start position:0%
it talks about the number of Overdose
 
05:27:13.128 --> 05:27:13.138 align:start position:0%
deaths how many overdose deaths are
 
05:27:15.410 --> 05:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
attributable to marijuana and how does
 
05:27:18.770 --> 05:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
this chart relate to your argument
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
I don't have any data in my head with
 
05:27:23.810 --> 05:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
respect to marijuana overdose deaths if
 
05:27:27.350 --> 05:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
you can assign a factor to marijuana
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
impairment to motor vehicle fatalities
 
05:27:32.448 --> 05:27:32.458 align:start position:0%
and teen suicides you may be you may be
 
05:27:36.050 --> 05:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
able to extrapolate a number there but
 
05:27:39.230 --> 05:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
certainly chronic use of cannabinoids
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
does factor into the fatalities in motor
 
05:27:44.570 --> 05:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
vehicle crashes and the team suicide the
 
05:27:47.570 --> 05:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
data on that is in fact undeniable
 
05:27:48.770 --> 05:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
just follow
 
05:27:50.930 --> 05:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
for the question so the chart talks
 
05:27:54.530 --> 05:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
about a heroin and opioid overdoses and
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering how that relates to
 
05:27:58.550 --> 05:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization that's what the
 
05:27:59.930 --> 05:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
chart says here
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
well the opioid overdose is here in the
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as you're I'm
 
05:28:06.530 --> 05:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
sure more well aware than anyone
 
05:28:08.690 --> 05:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
um is not decreasing in fact it's
 
05:28:11.208 --> 05:28:11.218 align:start position:0%
increased over the last couple years and
 
05:28:13.190 --> 05:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
so the question I I point to anyone is
 
05:28:14.770 --> 05:28:14.780 align:start position:0%
and the number of
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
Ed visits emergency department visits at
 
05:28:20.690 --> 05:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
least with respect to cannabis that was
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
tracked for some period of time by the
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
department of safety here in New
 
05:28:26.570 --> 05:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire increased substantially in
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
2021 right I don't have the latest data
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of Overdose deaths I don't have
 
05:28:33.948 --> 05:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
overdose death state or with respect to
 
05:28:37.250 --> 05:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis use but again there is an
 
05:28:39.770 --> 05:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
undeniable correlation between
 
05:28:41.930 --> 05:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
legalization and increased fatalities
 
05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
and teen suicides
 
05:28:46.010 --> 05:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the Texas data which
 
05:28:47.890 --> 05:28:47.900 align:start position:0%
is in my packet
 
05:28:50.810 --> 05:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
marijuana was the number one controlled
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
drug that was involved in child fatality
 
05:28:56.750 --> 05:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
cases in the state of Texas child
 
05:28:58.850 --> 05:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
fatality cases
 
05:29:01.970 --> 05:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
so there's another correlation
 
05:29:04.010 --> 05:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to this and it's not
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents it's in it's in the
 
05:29:06.840 --> 05:29:07.910 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents it's in it's in the
lives

05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
lives
 
05:29:10.368 --> 05:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
of the people that you represent and
 
05:29:13.010 --> 05:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
that we serve

I'm the change I mean my major
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony will be for the whole house I
 
05:29:41.150 --> 05:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
just done a couple of statements I want
 
05:29:44.330 --> 05:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
to make here is I was going to introduce
 
05:29:47.330 --> 05:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
Sue home alone but she's already spoken
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
which is good but my main concern is I
 
05:29:53.330 --> 05:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
just hope the statement that this
 
05:29:56.830 --> 05:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.690 --> 05:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
criteria they used against other bills
 
05:30:02.090 --> 05:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
that were against federal law
 
05:30:05.810 --> 05:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
for example the home distillation of
 
05:30:05.820 --> 05:30:06.708 align:start position:0%
for example the home distillation of
alcohol

05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
it was against federal law so is this
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
against federal law also in the comment
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
a question that was asked
 
05:30:21.948 --> 05:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
Ms homila is on the black market
 
05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
so let's make everything legal so it
 
05:30:26.750 --> 05:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be on the black market
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
like cocaine and Fentanyl
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
the point is the black market will still
 
05:30:36.890 --> 05:30:36.900 align:start position:0%
exist with us selling legally and it
 
05:30:39.410 --> 05:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
will be cheaper on the black market so
 
05:30:42.890 --> 05:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's not going to fix anything so thank
 
05:30:42.900 --> 05:30:46.010 align:start position:0%
it's not going to fix anything so thank
you

05:30:46.010 --> 05:30:46.020 align:start position:0%

05:30:49.970 --> 05:30:49.980 align:start position:0%

they do

nobody oversees the product quality or

some sellers in the illegal Market offer

05:33:04.730 --> 05:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
then they prefer to patronize a legal
 
05:33:07.788 --> 05:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
Market they don't want to participate in
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
a black market
 
05:33:13.490 --> 05:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized are realizing
 
05:33:15.410 --> 05:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
significant tax revenues from this
 
05:33:18.350 --> 05:33:18.360 align:start position:0%

opportunities
 
05:33:23.090 --> 05:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
I believe that cannabis legalization
 
05:33:25.250 --> 05:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
would also improve the police community
 
05:33:28.128 --> 05:33:28.138 align:start position:0%
relations because it no longer forces
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
police to be the bad guys carrying out a
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis arrest that most people
 
05:33:36.530 --> 05:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
consider ridiculous and unjust
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes for our youth lifelong
 
05:33:39.840 --> 05:33:41.390 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes for our youth lifelong
harming

05:33:41.390 --> 05:33:41.400 align:start position:0%

05:33:43.550 --> 05:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
I've testified in favor of cannabis
 
05:33:46.430 --> 05:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
policy reform for the last 16 years in
 
05:33:48.350 --> 05:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
this house in the Senate
 
05:33:52.368 --> 05:33:52.378 align:start position:0%
and when I started no state or country
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
lawfully supported cannabis
 
05:33:56.990 --> 05:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
for adult use
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
in that time
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
seven countries 21 states four
 
05:34:04.368 --> 05:34:04.378 align:start position:0%
territories to include our own
 
05:34:07.128 --> 05:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
Washington DC have legalized cannabis
 
05:34:09.170 --> 05:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
for adult use
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should not consider this
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
issue because it's popular
 
05:34:16.970 --> 05:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
and obviously we didn't over the last
 
05:34:18.170 --> 05:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
several years
 
05:34:19.970 --> 05:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
but the state should support it now
 
05:34:22.730 --> 05:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
because it is smart and it is
 
05:34:22.740 --> 05:34:24.288 align:start position:0%
because it is smart and it is
responsible

05:34:24.288 --> 05:34:24.298 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
05:34:26.690 --> 05:34:26.700 align:start position:0%
you will likely hear many reasons why
 
05:34:28.970 --> 05:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
this bill should not be passed
 
05:34:32.810 --> 05:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
marijuana is not a gateway drug as one
 
05:34:32.820 --> 05:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
marijuana is not a gateway drug as one
example

05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
and there are so many other pieces of
 
05:34:36.240 --> 05:34:38.510 align:start position:0%
and there are so many other pieces of
misinformation

05:34:38.510 --> 05:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's just far too much misinformation
 
05:34:43.010 --> 05:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
and opposition
 
05:34:46.368 --> 05:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
to efforts like these
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
use by youth will not exclude
 
05:34:51.410 --> 05:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized cannabis do
 
05:34:53.990 --> 05:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
not show increase in use because legal
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
sellers are subject to licensing
 
05:34:55.440 --> 05:34:56.570 align:start position:0%
sellers are subject to licensing
requirements

05:34:56.570 --> 05:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:34:58.430 --> 05:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
strict regulation
 
05:35:01.010 --> 05:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
surprise inspections
 
05:35:03.650 --> 05:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
legalization is not permission or
 
05:35:05.810 --> 05:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
recommendation to use
 
05:35:07.970 --> 05:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
we're not here to give permission
 
05:35:10.570 --> 05:35:10.580 align:start position:0%
we're not here to condone what people do
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're here to admit that we know people
 
05:35:15.830 --> 05:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
do it a lot of people do it
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
people who want to do it already do
 
05:35:20.930 --> 05:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
other states have shown that
 
05:35:26.330 --> 05:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
legalization is not a doomsday scenario
 
05:35:28.128 --> 05:35:28.138 align:start position:0%
in his common sense
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
and it is responsible legislation which
 
05:35:32.090 --> 05:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
time has proven
 
05:35:34.490 --> 05:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
to be successful
 
05:35:37.070 --> 05:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
in summary this comprehensive Reform
 
05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
Bill would move our state forward an
 
05:35:42.050 --> 05:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
improvement of Public Safety and healing
 
05:35:43.850 --> 05:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
police community relations
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%

and I want to thank each of you
 
05:35:55.970 --> 05:35:55.980 align:start position:0%

thank you any questions sitting done
 
05:36:04.128 --> 05:36:04.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
um now we'll have the Department of
 
05:36:07.850 --> 05:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
05:36:18.770 --> 05:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.810 --> 05:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
05:36:22.550 --> 05:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee thanks for the opportunity to
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
provide testimony on this legislation my
 
05:36:26.930 --> 05:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Holt I am the
 
05:36:28.788 --> 05:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Department's
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:36:33.170 --> 05:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm Jenny O Higgins I'm the
 
05:36:35.510 --> 05:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison for the division for
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
05:36:38.690 --> 05:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have a position
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
um however we would like to take the
 
05:36:43.730 --> 05:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide some information
 
05:36:45.288 --> 05:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
to the committee relative to certain
 
05:36:46.788 --> 05:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
Public Health matters
 
05:36:49.128 --> 05:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
um associated with the bill
 
05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
um we first first of all we appreciate
 
05:36:52.788 --> 05:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
the thoughtfulness that the drafters of
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
this bill took to approach the state's
 
05:36:57.770 --> 05:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and the licensed alternative
 
05:37:01.850 --> 05:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
treatment centers in the state which
 
05:37:04.070 --> 05:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
which sell cannabis to therapeutic
 
05:37:06.530 --> 05:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients however we do have
 
05:37:09.410 --> 05:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
some issues of concern with the bill and
 
05:37:11.690 --> 05:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
we have a number of recommendations for
 
05:37:14.810 --> 05:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
improvement I'll let Jenny start
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
sure so the bill establishes a substance
 
05:37:18.288 --> 05:37:18.298 align:start position:0%
abuse and Recovery Fund to be
 
05:37:21.050 --> 05:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
administered by the department and in
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
order to be used for Behavioral Health
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
uses so there's no appropriation in this
 
05:37:26.510 --> 05:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill for additional
 
05:37:28.010 --> 05:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
Department staff that would be needed to
 
05:37:30.350 --> 05:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
administer that fund there's not a clear
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
time frame for the disbursement of the
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
remaining funds in that fund
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
um and not a separate appropriation for
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
a preliminary public media campaign in
 
05:37:41.208 --> 05:37:41.218 align:start position:0%
order to get Upstream on the prevention
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
prior to the rollout of the adult use
 
05:37:46.368 --> 05:37:46.378 align:start position:0%
program and and the bill also does not
 
05:37:48.770 --> 05:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
follow some of the Clean Air acts that
 
05:37:50.690 --> 05:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
we had discussed in other versions of
 
05:37:52.610 --> 05:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
this bill and I don't know if you want
 
05:37:53.510 --> 05:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
to go through some of the other
 
05:37:57.410 --> 05:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
technical challenges as well thanks
 
05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
um so one of the issues that we've
 
05:38:00.288 --> 05:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
identified is that the the bill does not
 
05:38:02.510 --> 05:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
set a limit on the number of licenses
 
05:38:05.230 --> 05:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to be held by a single entity
 
05:38:07.490 --> 05:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
such limits are considered to be an
 
05:38:09.230 --> 05:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
important Safeguard against large
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
corporate interests from dominating the
 
05:38:13.010 --> 05:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
Kansas cannabis industry in in New
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the last issue concern I'd
 
05:38:17.208 --> 05:38:17.218 align:start position:0%
like to raise is that the bill does not
 
05:38:18.650 --> 05:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
require that Cannabis Testing
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
Laboratories be independent the bill
 
05:38:22.788 --> 05:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
would allow a testing laboratory to be
 
05:38:24.410 --> 05:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
owned and operated by the same entity
 
05:38:27.890 --> 05:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
that owns a cultivation manufacturing or
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
retail cannabis facility creating a
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
potential conflict of interest between
 
05:38:34.368 --> 05:38:34.378 align:start position:0%
the testing lab and the products they
 
05:38:35.448 --> 05:38:35.458 align:start position:0%
are testing
 
05:38:38.990 --> 05:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
we've identified a number of issues that
 
05:38:41.448 --> 05:38:41.458 align:start position:0%
are recommendations for improvement of
 
05:38:42.708 --> 05:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:38:44.330 --> 05:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to just go go through them
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
I'll provide the written testimony Upon
 
05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
Our close it has more detail but for
 
05:38:52.190 --> 05:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
instance the uh the duties of the
 
05:38:53.570 --> 05:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Advisory board that was
 
05:38:55.730 --> 05:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier could be expanded to
 
05:38:58.850 --> 05:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
require the board to expert exercise its
 
05:39:00.470 --> 05:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
expertise on certain issues for example
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
from a public health perspective the
 
05:39:04.430 --> 05:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
board could be required to consider and
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
make recommendations on such things as
 
05:39:09.050 --> 05:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
potency serving size advertising
 
05:39:12.650 --> 05:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
restrictions and testing requirements
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
secondly the proposal to transfer the
 
05:39:17.448 --> 05:39:17.458 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program from the
 
05:39:18.788 --> 05:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
to the Cannabis commission would be
 
05:39:25.550 --> 05:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
better made to go to the HHS oversight
 
05:39:26.930 --> 05:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
committee rather than the standing
 
05:39:28.190 --> 05:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
policy committees
 
05:39:30.530 --> 05:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
another issue is that there is no
 
05:39:34.010 --> 05:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
explicit exemption from taxation or
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients when
 
05:39:38.208 --> 05:39:38.218 align:start position:0%
purchasing from a retail cannabis store
 
05:39:41.150 --> 05:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
under the proposed endorsement model nor
 
05:39:43.010 --> 05:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
is there a clear method for enforcing
 
05:39:45.650 --> 05:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
the limit on untaxed cannabis for this
 
05:39:45.660 --> 05:39:47.990 align:start position:0%
the limit on untaxed cannabis for this
population

05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:48.000 --> 05:39:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill contains an opportunity
 
05:39:52.910 --> 05:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire licensed alternative
 
05:39:54.890 --> 05:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
treatment centers to undergo a
 
05:39:56.930 --> 05:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
for-profit conversion but this is a
 
05:39:58.970 --> 05:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
one-time opportunity
 
05:40:01.610 --> 05:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
um removing the December 31st 2024
 
05:40:03.708 --> 05:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
deadline would provide more flexibility
 
05:40:07.010 --> 05:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
for the atcs uh to enter the market
 
05:40:07.020 --> 05:40:07.730 align:start position:0%
for the atcs uh to enter the market
um

05:40:07.730 --> 05:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:09.530 --> 05:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
there's a Prohibition on certain types
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
of solvent extraction but no penalty for
 
05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
violating that there's no prohibition on
 
05:40:16.990 --> 05:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
vaping cannabis in public
 
05:40:19.310 --> 05:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of technical issues
 
05:40:21.050 --> 05:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
with regard to consistency of language
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
of cannabis and cannabis products
 
05:40:26.770 --> 05:40:26.780 align:start position:0%
registration and licensure
 
05:40:29.868 --> 05:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
regulations and rules Etc
 
05:40:31.250 --> 05:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's another uh the the testimony
 
05:40:35.330 --> 05:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
that I'll hand out um has a little more
 
05:40:36.708 --> 05:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
detail on this
 
05:40:39.288 --> 05:40:39.298 align:start position:0%
um we are available to participate in
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
any subcommittee work with the committee
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
or uh the sponsors for making
 
05:40:44.690 --> 05:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
improvements to this bill
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take any questions any
 
05:40:47.280 --> 05:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take any questions any
questions

05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:41:02.810 --> 05:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.770 --> 05:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
okay uh chair will call on Matt Simon
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:25.128 --> 05:41:25.138 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
05:41:26.810 --> 05:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
this microphone's even shorter than it
 
05:41:26.820 --> 05:41:28.850 align:start position:0%
this microphone's even shorter than it
looks

05:41:28.850 --> 05:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
looks
 
05:41:30.530 --> 05:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Matt Simon I
 
05:41:31.730 --> 05:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
serve as director of public and
 
05:41:32.930 --> 05:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
government relations for Prime
 
05:41:34.550 --> 05:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers in New
 
05:41:37.010 --> 05:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm testifying in support of
 
05:41:39.470 --> 05:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
HB 639 I believe this is the most
 
05:41:41.930 --> 05:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and well-crafted cannabis
 
05:41:45.550 --> 05:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill that's been before this house
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
established in 2016 Prime ATC is one of
 
05:41:50.330 --> 05:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
the non-profit alternative treatment
 
05:41:52.010 --> 05:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
centers that's licensed to provide
 
05:41:53.570 --> 05:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis to registered
 
05:41:55.610 --> 05:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
patients in New Hampshire we have
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
approximately 55 staff members we
 
05:41:59.448 --> 05:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
operate a production facility in
 
05:42:01.250 --> 05:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and dispensaries in
 
05:42:04.368 --> 05:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and Chichester our ATC has had
 
05:42:06.530 --> 05:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
only one Focus up to this point in our
 
05:42:08.930 --> 05:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
existence and that is serving registered
 
05:42:12.410 --> 05:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
patients here in New Hampshire
 
05:42:14.510 --> 05:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
prior to taking this job I worked for 15
 
05:42:16.430 --> 05:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
years on campus policy in New Hampshire
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
and other states gotten to see how some
 
05:42:22.368 --> 05:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
of these laws have been implemented and
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
how some of them have worked out
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
I want to focus first and foremost on
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
how this bill would impact New Hampshire
 
05:42:32.750 --> 05:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
from Prime atc's perspective
 
05:42:34.730 --> 05:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
so with cannabis legalization there are
 
05:42:36.650 --> 05:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
essentially two issues some people
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
really like cannabis legalization
 
05:42:40.368 --> 05:42:40.378 align:start position:0%
because it expands personal freedom for
 
05:42:42.650 --> 05:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
adults other people like cannabis
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
legalization because it presents an
 
05:42:46.670 --> 05:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Meaningful regulation
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and consumer protection so I'm here to
 
05:42:50.570 --> 05:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
support this bill for both of those
 
05:42:53.390 --> 05:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
reasons I think successful cannabis
 
05:42:55.970 --> 05:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
legalization policy both expands freedom
 
05:42:58.190 --> 05:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
for adults and balances that with
 
05:43:00.530 --> 05:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
effective regulation that is simply not
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
possible when the product is produced
 
05:43:05.510 --> 05:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
transported and sold in an illicit
 
05:43:07.610 --> 05:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
unregulated Market
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill does that
 
05:43:11.448 --> 05:43:11.458 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns we've had about
 
05:43:13.730 --> 05:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
previous bills that have been considered
 
05:43:16.850 --> 05:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh first and foremost some of them have
 
05:43:19.610 --> 05:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
not thoughtfully sought to integrate the
 
05:43:22.610 --> 05:43:22.620 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program into the
 
05:43:26.090 --> 05:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
new adult use regime
 
05:43:29.090 --> 05:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
this bill takes a very thoughtful slow
 
05:43:31.368 --> 05:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
deliberative approach to that transition
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that patients are not left
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
behind to make sure that atcs are
 
05:43:38.208 --> 05:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
required to continue prioritizing
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
patients if in fact they do expand to
 
05:43:42.830 --> 05:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
serve the adult use market and
 
05:43:45.288 --> 05:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
ultimately envisioning a process where
 
05:43:47.330 --> 05:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
these new businesses could seek a
 
05:43:49.730 --> 05:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis certification as Mr
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
Holt mentioned ultimately expanding
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
access for patients if we don't expand
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
access for patients there are only seven
 
05:43:58.128 --> 05:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in the state
 
05:44:00.650 --> 05:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
if we had 100 adult use stores say and
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
seven medical dispensaries that would be
 
05:44:05.570 --> 05:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
much better access for adults than for
 
05:44:07.490 --> 05:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
registered patients so we don't want to
 
05:44:08.810 --> 05:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
leave patients behind we want to make
 
05:44:12.110 --> 05:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
sure that their options improve uh as
 
05:44:14.750 --> 05:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
options for adults improved and this
 
05:44:17.930 --> 05:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
required quite a lot of thought that the
 
05:44:19.788 --> 05:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
Coalition put into this so I would
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
encourage you to keep that in mind as
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
you consider any changes
 
05:44:27.110 --> 05:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
secondly more broadly would this
 
05:44:29.330 --> 05:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
legislation create a broad distribution
 
05:44:31.610 --> 05:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
of economic opportunities or would it
 
05:44:34.970 --> 05:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
only benefit a few corporations or the
 
05:44:37.368 --> 05:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
state itself
 
05:44:39.948 --> 05:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
this is a business that has been
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
prohibited and underground and illegal
 
05:44:43.910 --> 05:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
for many decades
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
this I've come to view this as a really
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
awesome opportunity really a one-time
 
05:44:51.288 --> 05:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
opportunity to transition from a
 
05:44:53.930 --> 05:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
prohibited unregulated Market into a
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
regulated market there are a lot of ways
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
to get it right and a lot of ways to get
 
05:45:00.708 --> 05:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
it wrong over taxation is one way over
 
05:45:02.810 --> 05:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
regulation is one way
 
05:45:05.690 --> 05:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
I think this bill crafts a very good
 
05:45:07.788 --> 05:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
approach to that and make sure that
 
05:45:10.610 --> 05:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
we're not simply transitioning to yet
 
05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
another industry we're only a few
 
05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh entities get to make money or the
 
05:45:18.288 --> 05:45:18.298 align:start position:0%
state itself that we're giving people an
 
05:45:20.448 --> 05:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
opportunity to exceed to succeed in the
 
05:45:23.090 --> 05:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cannabis industry
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
and spreading that opportunity broadly
 
05:45:29.288 --> 05:45:29.298 align:start position:0%
third point is does the bill repair
 
05:45:32.030 --> 05:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
damage caused by the war on cannabis
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
such as including Provisions to an all
 
05:45:37.010 --> 05:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
past criminal records so we've heard
 
05:45:38.750 --> 05:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
that cannabis has decriminalized in New
 
05:45:41.690 --> 05:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is true up to a point in
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
2017 the state decriminalized possession
 
05:45:47.048 --> 05:45:47.058 align:start position:0%
of three-quarters of an ounce or less
 
05:45:49.970 --> 05:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
replacing a criminal penalty with a 100
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
fine so anybody caught with three
 
05:45:54.890 --> 05:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
quarters of an ounce or less is
 
05:45:57.708 --> 05:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
currently being fined uh anybody with
 
05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
more than three quarters of an ounce is
 
05:46:01.430 --> 05:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
still committing a criminal offense so
 
05:46:02.750 --> 05:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's legal to buy an ounce in
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if I buy an ounce in
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I'm committing a crime
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
when I cross the border and could be
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
arrested for that so there still are a
 
05:46:12.410 --> 05:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
number of arrests happening I think the
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
ACLU will present the exact numbers
 
05:46:18.590 --> 05:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
but as we transition to legality we want
 
05:46:20.570 --> 05:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if businesses are
 
05:46:22.128 --> 05:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
going to make a lot of money off this
 
05:46:23.570 --> 05:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
the state's going to make a lot of money
 
05:46:25.070 --> 05:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
off this there are still thousands of
 
05:46:26.510 --> 05:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
granted stairs walking around with
 
05:46:28.730 --> 05:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
criminal records that are holding them
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
back economically and we want to make
 
05:46:33.230 --> 05:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
sure that there is fairness restored to
 
05:46:34.850 --> 05:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
the greatest extent possible
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
so I think the bill does that at least
 
05:46:39.110 --> 05:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
to a significant extent and fourth Point
 
05:46:41.510 --> 05:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
final Point does it create a sensible
 
05:46:43.250 --> 05:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
transparent regulatory process to
 
05:46:45.048 --> 05:46:45.058 align:start position:0%
protect consumers and minimize any
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
potential impacts so I'm here to tell
 
05:46:50.690 --> 05:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
you cannabis is not harmless not
 
05:46:52.970 --> 05:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
harmless full stop it's less harmful
 
05:46:54.110 --> 05:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
than alcohol
 
05:46:56.750 --> 05:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
and as we've learned from alcohol the
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
harms associated with alcohol are much
 
05:47:00.770 --> 05:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
better managed through a regulated
 
05:47:03.410 --> 05:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
system than they were during the 1920s I
 
05:47:05.208 --> 05:47:05.218 align:start position:0%
think we should view this issue through
 
05:47:07.610 --> 05:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
a similar lens this is an opportunity to
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
transition from the violence and
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
Corruption and unregulated products of
 
05:47:15.948 --> 05:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
prohibition and and get to a better
 
05:47:17.868 --> 05:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
place but I do think the independent
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board is a key feature of that
 
05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
other states have found that having
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
oversight of that implementation process
 
05:47:27.170 --> 05:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
is really important we're always
 
05:47:28.730 --> 05:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
learning new things from other states
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the best states I think have been
 
05:47:34.010 --> 05:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
able to adapt on the fly as they learn
 
05:47:37.670 --> 05:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:39.890 --> 05:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
the last point I want to make
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
we've all heard that cannabis is
 
05:47:43.490 --> 05:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
available on the illicit market we've
 
05:47:44.930 --> 05:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
heard that it's available right across
 
05:47:47.090 --> 05:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
the borders I haven't heard anybody
 
05:47:49.128 --> 05:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
point out that it's also available in
 
05:47:50.570 --> 05:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I don't mean from the
 
05:47:53.930 --> 05:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
atcs so hemp cultivation was legalized
 
05:47:57.048 --> 05:47:57.058 align:start position:0%
by the the farm bill in 2018 which
 
05:47:59.510 --> 05:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
created a national hemp industry at the
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
time most people didn't realize that you
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
could grow a field of hemp harvest the
 
05:48:05.810 --> 05:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
CBD from that hemp and then chemically
 
05:48:08.930 --> 05:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
convert it into a THC product
 
05:48:10.850 --> 05:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
so you can walk into some New Hampshire
 
05:48:12.650 --> 05:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
gas stations some New Hampshire vape
 
05:48:15.650 --> 05:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
shops and you will see products that
 
05:48:17.868 --> 05:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
look like cannabis products and in fact
 
05:48:20.208 --> 05:48:20.218 align:start position:0%
they are THC products they're derived
 
05:48:23.570 --> 05:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
from hemp some of them have been not
 
05:48:25.788 --> 05:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
really tested on humans they're really
 
05:48:28.970 --> 05:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
kind of very alarming to a lot of us who
 
05:48:30.830 --> 05:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
are quite comfortable with regular
 
05:48:33.708 --> 05:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis one in particular is called THC
 
05:48:36.470 --> 05:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
acetate or thco which is more
 
05:48:38.208 --> 05:48:38.218 align:start position:0%
intoxicating by all accounts than
 
05:48:40.490 --> 05:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
regular THC I got a picture on my phone
 
05:48:42.230 --> 05:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
from a Sunoco gas station in New
 
05:48:44.090 --> 05:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where this product is sitting
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
right there on the counter and I don't
 
05:48:47.330 --> 05:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
know if people were being carded to buy
 
05:48:48.890 --> 05:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
these things I know they are an
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
independently lab tested I know they
 
05:48:53.090 --> 05:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
aren't regulated these are THC products
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
they cause impairment any any problem
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
that could be caused by cannabis itself
 
05:49:01.368 --> 05:49:01.378 align:start position:0%
could be caused and arguably and then
 
05:49:03.230 --> 05:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
some by something like
 
05:49:06.650 --> 05:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
THC acetate so
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
THC is here cannabinoids are here one of
 
05:49:10.730 --> 05:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
the features of this bill is it would
 
05:49:13.368 --> 05:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
put the sale of all GHC products under
 
05:49:15.708 --> 05:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
the purview of one single cannabis
 
05:49:15.718 --> 05:49:16.970 align:start position:0%
the purview of one single cannabis

05:49:25.910 --> 05:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much
 
05:49:28.610 --> 05:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
chair will call on Beth scare from
 
05:49:28.620 --> 05:49:37.970 align:start position:0%
chair will call on Beth scare from
Nashua

05:49:37.970 --> 05:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
hi I'm committee members I'm testifying
 
05:49:43.730 --> 05:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
today because marijuana has devastated
 
05:49:45.530 --> 05:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
my family
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
my older brother started smoking
 
05:49:50.090 --> 05:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
marijuana at a young age and as a
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
teenager he became a paranoid
 
05:49:51.840 --> 05:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
teenager he became a paranoid
schizophrenic

05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
schizophrenic
 
05:49:55.850 --> 05:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
he's been homeless most of the last 50
 
05:49:57.650 --> 05:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
years of his life
 
05:50:00.410 --> 05:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
and this happened back in the 70s when
 
05:50:04.250 --> 05:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
marijuana had a very low level of THC
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
with the new dangerous high THC products
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
many more families are suffering the
 
05:50:12.170 --> 05:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
same Devastation that we have
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
and on your desk
 
05:50:18.410 --> 05:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
I handed you this article from Tablet
 
05:50:18.420 --> 05:50:19.430 align:start position:0%
I handed you this article from Tablet
Mag

05:50:19.430 --> 05:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
Mag
 
05:50:23.208 --> 05:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
and um I read some very scary statistics
 
05:50:26.448 --> 05:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
in that article how weed became the new
 
05:50:26.458 --> 05:50:28.788 align:start position:0%
in that article how weed became the new
OxyContin

05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
OxyContin
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
if you've ever smoked a bowl and became
 
05:50:32.810 --> 05:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
a rationally anxious that everyone is
 
05:50:34.910 --> 05:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
staring at you and knows you're high
 
05:50:36.890 --> 05:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
what you experienced was a mild symptom
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
of cannabis induced psychosis according
 
05:50:43.128 --> 05:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
to one study about 40 percent of people
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
react this way
 
05:50:48.170 --> 05:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
If you experience that paranoia and keep
 
05:50:51.250 --> 05:50:51.260 align:start position:0%
smoking on a regular basis nonetheless
 
05:50:54.170 --> 05:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
especially with today's high potency THC
 
05:50:56.930 --> 05:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
products and especially if you're young
 
05:50:59.330 --> 05:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
there's a good chance you'll eventually
 
05:51:02.330 --> 05:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
suffer a full psychotic break
 
05:51:04.490 --> 05:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
35 percent of young people who
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
experience psychotic symptoms according
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
to another study eventually have such an
 
05:51:09.840 --> 05:51:11.030 align:start position:0%
to another study eventually have such an
episode

05:51:11.030 --> 05:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
episode
 
05:51:14.208 --> 05:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
and if you keep using after that you run
 
05:51:16.610 --> 05:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
a decent risk of ending up permanently
 
05:51:19.490 --> 05:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
schizophrenic or bipolar
 
05:51:21.770 --> 05:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis has by far the highest
 
05:51:23.990 --> 05:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
conversion rate to schizophrenia of any
 
05:51:27.048 --> 05:51:27.058 align:start position:0%
substance higher than meth higher than
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
opioids higher than LSD
 
05:51:32.628 --> 05:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
two Danish studies as well as a massive
 
05:51:35.090 --> 05:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
study from Finland put your chances at
 
05:51:37.730 --> 05:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
close to 50 percent
 
05:51:41.208 --> 05:51:41.218 align:start position:0%
one out of every 20 daily users can
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
expect to develop schizophrenia if they
 
05:51:45.770 --> 05:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
don't quit
 
05:51:47.810 --> 05:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
according to Dr Christine Miller an
 
05:51:50.330 --> 05:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
expert on psychotic disorders
 
05:51:55.208 --> 05:51:55.218 align:start position:0%
you can read the rest at bitly NH
 
05:51:59.048 --> 05:51:59.058 align:start position:0%
hb639 that's bitly
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
nh-hb639 please vote on an expedient to
 
05:52:05.390 --> 05:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
legislate on hb639 to spare other
 
05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:18.890 --> 05:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.190 --> 05:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh Frank Knack of the ACLU of New
 
05:52:22.200 --> 05:52:46.190 align:start position:0%
uh Frank Knack of the ACLU of New
Hampshire

05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
05:52:49.310 --> 05:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Frank Knack I'm the
 
05:52:53.208 --> 05:52:53.218 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
 
05:52:53.218 --> 05:52:54.590 align:start position:0%
policy director with the ACLU of New
Hampshire

05:52:54.590 --> 05:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:52:56.330 --> 05:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
um you have my written testimony so I
 
05:52:58.788 --> 05:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
won't read it verbatim uh if it's okay
 
05:53:00.470 --> 05:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
with y'all I'd like to First just talk
 
05:53:01.730 --> 05:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
about some of the issues that have been
 
05:53:03.288 --> 05:53:03.298 align:start position:0%
raised and some of the questions you all
 
05:53:05.448 --> 05:53:05.458 align:start position:0%
posed I think the first is regarding the
 
05:53:07.548 --> 05:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
polling and there was a question around
 
05:53:10.548 --> 05:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
age groups and particularly older age
 
05:53:12.948 --> 05:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
groups and support and so I looked at
 
05:53:14.570 --> 05:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
that UNH poll just to make sure you all
 
05:53:16.548 --> 05:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
had that information right now
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh according to that same UNH poll that
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley
 
05:53:22.610 --> 05:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier
 
05:53:25.430 --> 05:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
for age 65 and over uh the support
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
category was 64 of people 65 and older
 
05:53:29.280 --> 05:53:31.250 align:start position:0%
category was 64 of people 65 and older
supported

05:53:31.250 --> 05:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
supported
 
05:53:35.208 --> 05:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
um 13 were neutral and 23 opposed for 50
 
05:53:39.590 --> 05:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
to 64 age group 71 supported 13 were
 
05:53:42.110 --> 05:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
neutral and 16 opposed and then when you
 
05:53:46.368 --> 05:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
get down to the youth 18 to 34 or Young
 
05:53:48.770 --> 05:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
Folks it's 92 percent support four
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
percent neutral four percent opposed and
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
again that was a cross I looked at
 
05:53:55.190 --> 05:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
Regional that was across all regions of
 
05:53:56.510 --> 05:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there was strong support
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
and even among political parties they
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
even broke it down by a political party
 
05:54:03.470 --> 05:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
and so among Republicans you were at 60
 
05:54:07.010 --> 05:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
support 29 opposed Democrats 85 percent
 
05:54:09.170 --> 05:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
support four percent opposed
 
05:54:12.530 --> 05:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
independence 80 support 9 opposed so
 
05:54:15.288 --> 05:54:15.298 align:start position:0%
across all political parties across all
 
05:54:16.970 --> 05:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in New Hampshire across
 
05:54:20.390 --> 05:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
all ages there's strong support for this
 
05:54:22.010 --> 05:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
legislation and again we're here in
 
05:54:25.070 --> 05:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
support of hb639
 
05:54:26.208 --> 05:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
um I also there were some questions
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
around traffic fatalities and
 
05:54:30.530 --> 05:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
particularly in um in New Hampshire post
 
05:54:33.770 --> 05:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
legalization uh starting uh with Maine
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
and UK and Vermont and Massachusetts and
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
so first just noting that uh there's
 
05:54:41.570 --> 05:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
been studies that looked at all the
 
05:54:41.580 --> 05:54:42.530 align:start position:0%
been studies that looked at all the
states

05:54:42.530 --> 05:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:54:44.930 --> 05:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
um and I cite this in my in my fact
 
05:54:47.628 --> 05:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
sheet that I gave you all but that it
 
05:54:49.430 --> 05:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
appears that marijuana legalization has
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
had quote little to no effect unquote on
 
05:54:54.530 --> 05:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
traffic accidents and fatalities and
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
specific to the question in New
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire after that was asked earlier I
 
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
went and looked at the state highway
 
05:55:03.230 --> 05:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
traffic report for New Hampshire from
 
05:55:05.510 --> 05:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
the U.S Department of Transportation and
 
05:55:07.628 --> 05:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
in 2016 when our first neighbor
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
legalized we were at 136 annual deaths
 
05:55:12.650 --> 05:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
on the traffic on traffic and traffic
 
05:55:15.650 --> 05:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
fatalities in 2020 the most recent data
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
available we're at 104. so from 136 to
 
05:55:21.830 --> 05:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
104 and if some people might argue 2020
 
05:55:23.930 --> 05:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
was a covid year less people are driving
 
05:55:26.448 --> 05:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
if we just go back a year to 2019 where
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
we were at 101. so substantially fewer
 
05:55:31.368 --> 05:55:31.378 align:start position:0%
so we're not saying that it is safe but
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
as Matt Simon talked about we're not
 
05:55:35.448 --> 05:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
arguing here that marijuana is a safe
 
05:55:35.458 --> 05:55:36.548 align:start position:0%
arguing here that marijuana is a safe
product

05:55:36.548 --> 05:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
product
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
unregulated but that that's exactly what
 
05:55:40.368 --> 05:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to do have a
 
05:55:41.890 --> 05:55:41.900 align:start position:0%
regulated product
 
05:55:45.410 --> 05:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have safer communities
 
05:55:46.910 --> 05:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
and again there's been a lot of talk
 
05:55:48.650 --> 05:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
about youth use
 
05:55:51.530 --> 05:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
and so I want to point specifically to a
 
05:55:53.690 --> 05:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
study by the Journal of the American
 
05:55:55.490 --> 05:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
Medical Association where they say
 
05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana laws were
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
associated with an eight percent
 
05:56:01.430 --> 05:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
decrease in the odds of marijuana use
 
05:56:03.770 --> 05:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
and a nine percent decrease in the odds
 
05:56:06.590 --> 05:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
of frequent marijuana use again this is
 
05:56:08.930 --> 05:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
from the America Journal of the American
 
05:56:13.910 --> 05:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and to get to our main uh our you
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
know from the aclu's perspective our our
 
05:56:20.690 --> 05:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
main talking points on this issue you
 
05:56:22.128 --> 05:56:22.138 align:start position:0%
know I think while we've made great
 
05:56:24.048 --> 05:56:24.058 align:start position:0%
progress you know we are now we have
 
05:56:25.730 --> 05:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
decriminalized marijuana but people are
 
05:56:27.830 --> 05:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
still facing the rest for marijuana we
 
05:56:30.350 --> 05:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
looked at the FBI UCR data which is the
 
05:56:32.330 --> 05:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
data that you know agencies in New
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provide to the FBI so that we
 
05:56:36.048 --> 05:56:36.058 align:start position:0%
know crime stats in New Hampshire and
 
05:56:37.730 --> 05:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
arrest stats in New Hampshire
 
05:56:40.010 --> 05:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
and in 2021 the most recent year
 
05:56:43.010 --> 05:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
available uh of 1120 people were
 
05:56:44.868 --> 05:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
arrested and so while the vast majority
 
05:56:46.368 --> 05:56:46.378 align:start position:0%
of these those people are not going to
 
05:56:46.378 --> 05:56:47.208 align:start position:0%
of these those people are not going to
jail

05:56:47.208 --> 05:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
jail
 
05:56:48.770 --> 05:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
they are still having a criminal
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
conviction on their record
 
05:56:52.128 --> 05:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
um and that has huge collateral
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
consequences in terms of their ability
 
05:56:56.448 --> 05:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
to get employment to get housing
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and so it sets people up with
 
05:56:59.868 --> 05:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
additional hurdles that are completely
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to live productive and
 
05:57:03.650 --> 05:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
healthy lives
 
05:57:05.330 --> 05:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
I think it's really also important from
 
05:57:06.770 --> 05:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
our perspective to look at this as a
 
05:57:09.708 --> 05:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
racial justice issue and so the FBI UCR
 
05:57:12.288 --> 05:57:12.298 align:start position:0%
data portal in 2021 didn't provide the
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
racial breakdown so we're still
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
analyzing it from the spreadsheets but
 
05:57:17.628 --> 05:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
going back to 2020
 
05:57:19.368 --> 05:57:19.378 align:start position:0%
this is an issue where we know black
 
05:57:20.750 --> 05:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
people and white people from robust
 
05:57:22.730 --> 05:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
research use marijuana at roughly the
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
same rate nationally black people are
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
about 3.6 times more likely to be
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
arrested than white people for marijuana
 
05:57:28.920 --> 05:57:30.048 align:start position:0%
arrested than white people for marijuana
possession

05:57:30.048 --> 05:57:30.058 align:start position:0%
possession
 
05:57:32.570 --> 05:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's 4.6 times more
 
05:57:34.490 --> 05:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
likely so we're significantly higher
 
05:57:36.410 --> 05:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
than the national average and that
 
05:57:38.570 --> 05:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
disparity has actually gone up from 2.6
 
05:57:41.330 --> 05:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
times back in 2010 so we've seen a 46
 
05:57:43.128 --> 05:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
percent increase in the racial
 
05:57:45.590 --> 05:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
disparities in marijuana arrests in our
 
05:57:45.600 --> 05:57:46.730 align:start position:0%
disparities in marijuana arrests in our
state

05:57:46.730 --> 05:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:57:48.708 --> 05:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
and also we have to look at this as from
 
05:57:50.270 --> 05:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
a fiscal perspective so it's not only
 
05:57:51.770 --> 05:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
the revenue that would come in through
 
05:57:53.330 --> 05:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
legalization but we also have to think
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
about what we are spending now on the
 
05:57:56.690 --> 05:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement of marijuana possession laws
 
05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
so each of those 1100 plus marijuana
 
05:58:01.150 --> 05:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
arrests that we had in the past year
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
involved Court actors they involved law
 
05:58:05.690 --> 05:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement and so the ACLU had done a
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
report a while back where we calculated
 
05:58:10.368 --> 05:58:10.378 align:start position:0%
with an economist the cost the average
 
05:58:13.010 --> 05:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
cost for each marijuana at rest and so
 
05:58:14.990 --> 05:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
putting that methodology to the current
 
05:58:17.448 --> 05:58:17.458 align:start position:0%
arrest numbers we're spending about 2.6
 
05:58:19.310 --> 05:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars every year in New
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just enforcing our marijuana
 
05:58:23.570 --> 05:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
possession laws alone
 
05:58:25.128 --> 05:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
um so we think it's time for New
 
05:58:26.750 --> 05:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to move forward we think this
 
05:58:29.390 --> 05:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
is a responsible bill you know some of
 
05:58:30.830 --> 05:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised from folks
 
05:58:32.810 --> 05:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
about other states this bill is taking
 
05:58:34.490 --> 05:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
all the best practices from the states
 
05:58:36.288 --> 05:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
there's robust protections to keep
 
05:58:37.970 --> 05:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
children from getting access to these
 
05:58:40.368 --> 05:58:40.378 align:start position:0%
it's a big Bill that has been had a lot
 
05:58:42.350 --> 05:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
of thought put into it and we would
 
05:58:43.850 --> 05:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support and happy to
 
05:58:46.430 --> 05:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
okay any questions
 
05:58:50.990 --> 05:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much thank you
 
05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:01.250 --> 05:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt and the entire
 
05:59:03.170 --> 05:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my testimony today
 
05:59:05.150 --> 05:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Liz Barber and I'm a resident
 
05:59:07.310 --> 05:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
of Hollis New Hampshire I'm here to
 
05:59:09.470 --> 05:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to this bill
 
05:59:11.690 --> 05:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
I have grave concerns about the adverse
 
05:59:13.850 --> 05:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
results of the commercialization of
 
05:59:15.590 --> 05:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana on public health and Public
 
05:59:19.548 --> 05:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
Safety the legislation of marijuana will
 
05:59:21.230 --> 05:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
normalize its use and tell our
 
05:59:22.910 --> 05:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable teen population that it's
 
05:59:25.128 --> 05:59:25.138 align:start position:0%
okay to use it it's legal
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
aren't you concerned that we would lose
 
05:59:29.208 --> 05:59:29.218 align:start position:0%
more and more of our teens to The
 
05:59:31.548 --> 05:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
Addictive quality of marijuana
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
I know that some committee members are
 
05:59:36.890 --> 05:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
medical professionals to you I ask Will
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
you share information about The
 
05:59:40.850 --> 05:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
Addictive qualities of THC and the real
 
05:59:43.730 --> 05:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
hazards such as THC toxicity and
 
05:59:46.490 --> 05:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis use disorder with the committee
 
05:59:49.490 --> 05:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
let's not normalize marijuana use for
 
05:59:51.890 --> 05:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
teens regular marijuana use can impair
 
05:59:54.288 --> 05:59:54.298 align:start position:0%
memory and concentration and may
 
05:59:55.850 --> 05:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
interfere with learning
 
05:59:58.490 --> 05:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's also associated with lower odds of
 
05:59:59.930 --> 05:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
completing high school or getting
 
06:00:01.368 --> 06:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
college degrees
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
regular use of marijuana linked to
 
06:00:05.628 --> 06:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
psychological problems and higher chance
 
06:00:09.048 --> 06:00:09.058 align:start position:0%
of substance use disorder in adulthood
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
even using marijuana one time can alter
 
06:00:14.930 --> 06:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
motor control coordination and judgment
 
06:00:18.110 --> 06:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
this can contribute to unintentional
 
06:00:20.570 --> 06:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
deaths and injuries
 
06:00:22.730 --> 06:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
I'd like to tell you a teen addicted
 
06:00:22.740 --> 06:00:24.530 align:start position:0%
I'd like to tell you a teen addicted
story

06:00:24.530 --> 06:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
story
 
06:00:26.868 --> 06:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
Ethan Andrews started smoking marijuana
 
06:00:28.368 --> 06:00:28.378 align:start position:0%
during his sophomore year of high school
 
06:00:31.250 --> 06:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
in Colorado to help with his anxiety
 
06:00:33.530 --> 06:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
his casual marijuana use turned to
 
06:00:35.390 --> 06:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
smoking potent cannabis flour and
 
06:00:38.090 --> 06:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
concentrates known as dabs which contain
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
high levels of THC Andrews said he
 
06:00:44.390 --> 06:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
smoked every day from morning to night I
 
06:00:46.430 --> 06:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't think or sleep without it he
 
06:00:46.440 --> 06:00:47.448 align:start position:0%

two years after becoming an avid

06:00:54.530 --> 06:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
induced psychosis a condition including

in conclusion I ask that you consider my
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
testimony today along with the testimony

of others who are speaking against the
 
06:01:14.750 --> 06:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill New Hampshire is an island
 
06:01:17.090 --> 06:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
surrounded by States who have legalized
 
06:01:20.330 --> 06:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
marijuana and are now spending thousands
 
06:01:22.610 --> 06:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
of dollars maybe hundreds of thousands
 
06:01:25.250 --> 06:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
of dollars on additional Medical Care

marijuana use
 
06:01:31.128 --> 06:01:31.138 align:start position:0%
if you support this bill you will need
 
06:01:33.708 --> 06:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
to explain to us how the dollars balance
 
06:01:36.288 --> 06:01:36.298 align:start position:0%
out Revenue versus increased Medical
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%

um and my background of the former house

legal counsel I'm also a member of the
 
06:02:30.770 --> 06:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
Coalition that originally put together
 
06:02:33.948 --> 06:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
the proposals that are in this bill
 
06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and I was a member of the commission
 
06:02:37.610 --> 06:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
the state commission that studied for
 
06:02:41.330 --> 06:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
the legalization of marijuana in 2017.
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
um before I go on I'd encourage any of
 
06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
you to take a look at that the materials
 
06:02:48.890 --> 06:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
with that there are some studies that
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
will answer some of the questions I've
 
06:02:53.030 --> 06:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
heard today there's a Nitza study on
 
06:02:54.708 --> 06:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
whether or not being impaired with
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana basically it does some things
 
06:02:59.868 --> 06:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
to you that make you more impaired but
 
06:03:02.330 --> 06:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
it also makes people drive slower and so
 
06:03:03.948 --> 06:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
Nissa didn't actually come to any
 
06:03:06.288 --> 06:03:06.298 align:start position:0%
overall conclusions that being said
 
06:03:07.850 --> 06:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
nobody should Thrive under any
 
06:03:10.610 --> 06:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
substances whatsoever
 
06:03:10.620 --> 06:03:11.510 align:start position:0%
substances whatsoever
um

06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:14.868 --> 06:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
I had a I had a prepared statement that
 
06:03:16.910 --> 06:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
you have that has a lot of sort of
 
06:03:18.530 --> 06:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
technical things and talks about
 
06:03:20.330 --> 06:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
amendments but I'd like to talk to a
 
06:03:23.208 --> 06:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
couple things and be brief about my own
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
personal experiences about 10 days ago I
 
06:03:28.430 --> 06:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
had a infection and I was put on an
 
06:03:28.440 --> 06:03:29.750 align:start position:0%
had a infection and I was put on an
antibiotic

06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
antibiotic
 
06:03:32.690 --> 06:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
and after about two days I had a very
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
bad reaction to it my face started
 
06:03:37.128 --> 06:03:37.138 align:start position:0%
swelling I had to rush to an Urgent Care
 
06:03:40.010 --> 06:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
before the doctor's office were opened
 
06:03:41.930 --> 06:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
they gave me some
 
06:03:44.270 --> 06:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
advice and then later that night the
 
06:03:46.010 --> 06:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
swung started going down towards my
 
06:03:48.530 --> 06:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
throat and I was told get to an
 
06:03:51.048 --> 06:03:51.058 align:start position:0%
emergency room as quick as you can
 
06:03:53.208 --> 06:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
leaving church after I drove by the
 
06:03:55.128 --> 06:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
Epson police station I drove by the
 
06:03:56.868 --> 06:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
Chichester police station I drove by the
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
Concord Police Station on the way to
 
06:04:00.830 --> 06:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
Concord Hospital and it never occurred
 
06:04:02.810 --> 06:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
to me once to stop and ask a police
 
06:04:04.970 --> 06:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
officer for medical advice or for health
 
06:04:07.070 --> 06:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
advice I had many friends that are
 
06:04:09.530 --> 06:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
police officers I never call them up and
 
06:04:11.208 --> 06:04:11.218 align:start position:0%
ask them for how to deal with health
 
06:04:14.770 --> 06:04:14.780 align:start position:0%
problems there will be health problems
 
06:04:17.270 --> 06:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
if you legalize cannabis you already
 
06:04:19.070 --> 06:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
have the health problems here and it
 
06:04:21.230 --> 06:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
comes from the Cannabis that you can buy
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
legally out of state and the Cannabis
 
06:04:25.010 --> 06:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
you can buy on the street Which is far
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
more dangerous because it's not
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulated I heard several people say
 
06:04:31.548 --> 06:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
well the black market will still
 
06:04:33.530 --> 06:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
you'll always go lower
 
06:04:35.330 --> 06:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
um if you make the taxes high enough
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's true but when was the last time
 
06:04:39.770 --> 06:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
that you saw somebody selling
 
06:04:41.510 --> 06:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
um bear on the street corners you know
 
06:04:42.948 --> 06:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
opening up the coat and saying hey you
 
06:04:44.810 --> 06:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
want to buy some beer they don't do that
 
06:04:46.490 --> 06:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
because they can't compete with a legal
 
06:04:48.530 --> 06:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
regulated structure and if you do this
 
06:04:50.690 --> 06:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
right you will destroy the black market
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
in the state and that will do make
 
06:04:54.850 --> 06:04:54.860 align:start position:0%
everybody safer in the state
 
06:04:57.170 --> 06:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:04:59.208 --> 06:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
I was a public defender for many years
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
and I spent probably 46 years as a
 
06:05:04.910 --> 06:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyer
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't haven't done that for the
 
06:05:07.850 --> 06:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
last five or six years except for when
 
06:05:09.948 --> 06:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
there are vets that have help problems
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
with getting housing or jobs because
 
06:05:15.650 --> 06:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
marijuana cannabis prohibitions the VA
 
06:05:18.048 --> 06:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
until very recently was very strict on
 
06:05:19.610 --> 06:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
that so I would do criminal cases for
 
06:05:19.620 --> 06:05:21.110 align:start position:0%
that so I would do criminal cases for
them

06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:05:24.048 --> 06:05:24.058 align:start position:0%
in the 46 years of doing
 
06:05:26.690 --> 06:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
criminal defense I never had a client
 
06:05:29.628 --> 06:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
plead guilty to possession of marijuana
 
06:05:31.788 --> 06:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
simple possession I had people convicted
 
06:05:33.830 --> 06:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
of all kinds of drug things but nobody
 
06:05:35.330 --> 06:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
was ever convicted of possession of
 
06:05:37.730 --> 06:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the last 20 years I have
 
06:05:39.350 --> 06:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
never seen anybody with a lawyer
 
06:05:41.690 --> 06:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
convicted of possession of marijuana it
 
06:05:43.970 --> 06:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
just doesn't happen because prosecutors
 
06:05:45.708 --> 06:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to take the time it takes to
 
06:05:47.930 --> 06:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
actually prove the case so they always
 
06:05:49.610 --> 06:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
change it to something or they give some
 
06:05:52.490 --> 06:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
sort of a deal but it goes away nobody
 
06:05:54.650 --> 06:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
with a lawyer who has the resources to
 
06:05:56.570 --> 06:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
get a lawyer gets convicted of marijuana
 
06:05:59.090 --> 06:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
now but people do get convicted and the
 
06:06:00.830 --> 06:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
people that get convicted are the poor
 
06:06:03.530 --> 06:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
kids that can't afford a lawyer on their
 
06:06:05.448 --> 06:06:05.458 align:start position:0%
own and don't want to apply for State
 
06:06:06.470 --> 06:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
Warrior because they know they're going
 
06:06:08.090 --> 06:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
to have to pay it back and if they don't
 
06:06:10.128 --> 06:06:10.138 align:start position:0%
pay it back they're going to go to jail
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
those kids walk into arraignments
 
06:06:13.730 --> 06:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
without lawyers and they plead guilty
 
06:06:15.708 --> 06:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
all the time because they're told that's
 
06:06:17.270 --> 06:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the easy way up they don't know the
 
06:06:18.470 --> 06:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
consequences they don't know what's
 
06:06:19.730 --> 06:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
going to haunt them for the rest of
 
06:06:21.410 --> 06:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
their lives they don't know they'll have
 
06:06:23.288 --> 06:06:23.298 align:start position:0%
problems getting good jobs
 
06:06:26.208 --> 06:06:26.218 align:start position:0%
all they're basically their future is
 
06:06:28.610 --> 06:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
taken from them and stolen from them for
 
06:06:30.410 --> 06:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
something that we you know if you come
 
06:06:32.990 --> 06:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
from a well to do background you'd never
 
06:06:34.810 --> 06:06:34.820 align:start position:0%
pay that price that those poor kids paid
 
06:06:36.890 --> 06:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
you can see it every day in the
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
arraignments in district courts around
 
06:06:39.890 --> 06:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
here those are the people that get
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
convicted of possession of marijuana
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's whose Futures you will be saving
 
06:06:48.350 --> 06:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
more than anybody else so I urge you
 
06:06:50.930 --> 06:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
um to to I support the spelling I urge
 
06:06:53.090 --> 06:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
you to pass it and to stop the one-sided
 
06:06:54.948 --> 06:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
Madness of trying to treat health
 
06:06:57.890 --> 06:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
problems as police problems they're not
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
police problems they're health problems
 
06:07:01.490 --> 06:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
and we need health professionals part of
 
06:07:03.708 --> 06:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
this bill puts money towards build
 
06:07:05.930 --> 06:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
beefing up our
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
um Health Care system and counseling
 
06:07:08.400 --> 06:07:09.410 align:start position:0%
um Health Care system and counseling
system

06:07:09.410 --> 06:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
there is one particular thing I'd like
 
06:07:13.430 --> 06:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
to talk about which is the problem with
 
06:07:15.110 --> 06:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
Edibles there have been recent studies
 
06:07:17.628 --> 06:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
showing that Edibles themselves that
 
06:07:20.930 --> 06:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
high potency Edibles can potentially be
 
06:07:22.610 --> 06:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
a real serious problem for very young
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
children there's different ways to deal
 
06:07:26.990 --> 06:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
with that and you know one one way is to
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
try to change the behavior of their
 
06:07:30.590 --> 06:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
caretakers and teach them to be a little
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
bit more careful and I'm going to submit
 
06:07:35.330 --> 06:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
some proposals to do that but you should
 
06:07:37.990 --> 06:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
also give some careful thought to having
 
06:07:42.230 --> 06:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
potency limits on Edibles because unlike
 
06:07:44.448 --> 06:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
the smoke stuff which you you know how
 
06:07:46.910 --> 06:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
strong it is right away with Edibles you
 
06:07:48.470 --> 06:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't know for hours and people will
 
06:07:49.850 --> 06:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
keep eating them and eat them and eat
 
06:07:50.810 --> 06:07:50.820 align:start position:0%
them and then all of a sudden they're
 
06:07:52.190 --> 06:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
going to have some real serious problem
 
06:07:54.410 --> 06:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
so I'd ask you to give some thought to
 
06:07:56.208 --> 06:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
that aside from that I'd ask you to
 
06:07:58.010 --> 06:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
people listen to people like Kate gray
 
06:08:01.448 --> 06:08:01.458 align:start position:0%

06:09:00.890 --> 06:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
arguments but I am here to ask you to
 
06:09:02.530 --> 06:09:02.540 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
06:09:05.090 --> 06:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
something that sort of overlaps between
 
06:09:07.730 --> 06:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
the religious and the secular and that
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
is the principle of the common good
 
06:09:14.930 --> 06:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
which as you all know is laid out in the
 
06:09:16.570 --> 06:09:16.580 align:start position:0%
very first article of the New Hampshire
 
06:09:19.368 --> 06:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
Constitution as
 
06:09:22.128 --> 06:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
uh the reason or one of the reasons that
 
06:09:24.530 --> 06:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
government is instituted as it says it's
 
06:09:27.048 --> 06:09:27.058 align:start position:0%
instituted for the general good and then
 
06:09:31.490 --> 06:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
article uh three goes on to say that the
 
06:09:34.430 --> 06:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
protection of others is one of the
 
06:09:37.970 --> 06:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
foundational purposes of our society so
 
06:09:40.850 --> 06:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's the way that we're looking at
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
this and that we ask you to consider as
 
06:09:45.590 --> 06:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
you deliberate on this
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
I've um in the written testimony laid
 
06:09:51.770 --> 06:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
out four questions that we'd ask you to
 
06:09:54.830 --> 06:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
think about as you undertake your
 
06:09:54.840 --> 06:09:57.070 align:start position:0%
think about as you undertake your
deliberations

06:09:57.070 --> 06:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
06:09:59.810 --> 06:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
will legalization
 
06:10:02.868 --> 06:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
Advance the safety of our youth and
 
06:10:06.590 --> 06:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
improve family life in New Hampshire
 
06:10:09.830 --> 06:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
number two will legalization improve the
 
06:10:12.048 --> 06:10:12.058 align:start position:0%
public health
 
06:10:14.810 --> 06:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
number three will legalization improve
 
06:10:14.820 --> 06:10:16.850 align:start position:0%
number three will legalization improve
communities

06:10:16.850 --> 06:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
and number four will legalization make
 
06:10:23.150 --> 06:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
people better workers and strengthen our
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
business Workforce
 
06:10:27.350 --> 06:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
now in our view
 
06:10:29.590 --> 06:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
we think the answer to those questions
 
06:10:32.690 --> 06:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
is no and that's why we oppose it but I
 
06:10:34.990 --> 06:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
ask you to think about those as you
 
06:10:38.330 --> 06:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
Ponder this legislation and for those
 
06:10:41.390 --> 06:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
reasons we ask you to vote against the
 
06:10:44.390 --> 06:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
legalization of marijuana thank you Mr
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
chairman so I have a question for you
 
06:10:49.548 --> 06:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
Bob yes taking that list
 
06:10:52.868 --> 06:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
when our forefathers and their wisdom
 
06:10:55.070 --> 06:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
decided to create the State Liquor
 
06:10:55.080 --> 06:10:56.690 align:start position:0%
decided to create the State Liquor
Commission

06:10:56.690 --> 06:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
06:10:59.628 --> 06:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
did it meet those values that you just
 
06:10:59.638 --> 06:11:02.208 align:start position:0%
did it meet those values that you just
said

06:11:02.208 --> 06:11:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh I you know I don't know that Mr chair
 
06:11:07.610 --> 06:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
one of the things though is obviously
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
liquor was something that was very much
 
06:11:13.310 --> 06:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
a part of society at the time that the
 
06:11:15.830 --> 06:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
it was illegal it was a Prohibition so
 
06:11:18.170 --> 06:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
the end of the prohibition no I'm
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
talking about at the time of the
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
founding without it that's true so uh
 
06:11:23.520 --> 06:11:24.530 align:start position:0%
founding without it that's true so uh
um

06:11:24.530 --> 06:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:26.930 --> 06:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
you know I'm confident that the founding
 
06:11:29.030 --> 06:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
fathers would have had no problem with
 
06:11:31.430 --> 06:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
with liquor right I think George
 
06:11:32.810 --> 06:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
Washington had it with his own whiskey
 
06:11:34.850 --> 06:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
this Hillary yeah but I was just saying
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
that it's interesting you read that list
 
06:11:38.930 --> 06:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
because I would think about what
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
happened when the prohibition ended and
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire unlike its other
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
neighboring states it chose to dress I
 
06:11:50.448 --> 06:11:50.458 align:start position:0%
think those issues by creating the
 
06:11:54.170 --> 06:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:58.570 --> 06:11:58.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:02.270 --> 06:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative has a question
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
06:12:06.288 --> 06:12:06.298 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm intrigued by question one
 
06:12:08.690 --> 06:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
particularly in light of other testimony
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
that we've received today which boils
 
06:12:13.430 --> 06:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
down to what about the children
 
06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
what do you think is the role of
 
06:12:18.410 --> 06:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
families and parents in
 
06:12:20.448 --> 06:12:20.458 align:start position:0%
protecting children from the alleged
 
06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
evils of marijuana at what point does it
 
06:12:25.310 --> 06:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
become the role of families simply to
 
06:12:27.470 --> 06:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
help their children too
 
06:12:30.170 --> 06:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
avoid marijuana or to avoid becoming
 
06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
addicted to marijuana it seems to me
 
06:12:35.390 --> 06:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
that throughout this discussion we we've
 
06:12:36.890 --> 06:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
had parental abdication of
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility that suddenly we've left
 
06:12:40.970 --> 06:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
children to the streets to wander and
 
06:12:42.350 --> 06:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
find marijuana
 
06:12:44.150 --> 06:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
where do you think parents are in this
 
06:12:44.160 --> 06:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
where do you think parents are in this
discussion

06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
06:12:49.970 --> 06:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
Central role uh absolutely but I think
 
06:12:53.810 --> 06:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
that the the state government has a role
 
06:12:56.270 --> 06:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
to play in that right and so at a time
 
06:13:00.170 --> 06:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
when that we have a severe substance
 
06:13:03.048 --> 06:13:03.058 align:start position:0%
misuse crisis in the state I think the
 
06:13:04.970 --> 06:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
state is sending the wrong signal by
 
06:13:08.810 --> 06:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
saying this is okay I think that the
 
06:13:13.850 --> 06:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
state owes it to families to make it as
 
06:13:16.250 --> 06:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
easy as possible for families
 
06:13:19.490 --> 06:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
to work with their children and to keep
 
06:13:21.288 --> 06:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
them safe
 
06:13:24.410 --> 06:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:25.970 --> 06:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up do you think children
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
really pay attention to State policy
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
what can you say that again
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry do you think
 
06:13:37.310 --> 06:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:40.128 --> 06:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
well I'm the parent of children so
 
06:13:42.410 --> 06:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't know what children
 
06:13:44.810 --> 06:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
will pay attention to at any given time
 
06:13:44.820 --> 06:13:46.490 align:start position:0%
will pay attention to at any given time
but

06:13:46.490 --> 06:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:49.788 --> 06:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
um the uh no but their parents do right
 
06:13:51.470 --> 06:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:13:56.030 --> 06:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and and kids know what the state says
 
06:13:58.490 --> 06:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
06:14:01.190 --> 06:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that makes a big difference I think
 
06:14:03.470 --> 06:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative amen has a question
 
06:14:05.750 --> 06:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a short question uh
 
06:14:07.430 --> 06:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
from a theological
 
06:14:09.288 --> 06:14:09.298 align:start position:0%
um perspective since you're from the
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
diocese uh is it is it uh if if a
 
06:14:14.448 --> 06:14:14.458 align:start position:0%
parishioner smokes marijuana is that
 
06:14:16.670 --> 06:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
grounds for excommunication in the
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
church I'm just curious
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm not a theologian but I don't
 
06:14:27.070 --> 06:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:30.770 --> 06:14:30.780 align:start position:0%

I think probably one of the first most
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
important points to make is that this is
 
06:16:02.090 --> 06:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
not a partisan issue this is not a
 
06:16:03.288 --> 06:16:03.298 align:start position:0%
political issue
 
06:16:05.690 --> 06:16:05.700 align:start position:0%
this is an economic issue
 
06:16:09.548 --> 06:16:09.558 align:start position:0%
um this cannabis legalization
 
06:16:13.610 --> 06:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
is a much more potentially a much more
 
06:16:13.620 --> 06:16:15.708 align:start position:0%
is a much more potentially a much more
impactful

06:16:15.708 --> 06:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
impactful
 
06:16:18.230 --> 06:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and positive uh
 
06:16:18.240 --> 06:16:20.470 align:start position:0%
um and positive uh
um

06:16:20.470 --> 06:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:24.048 --> 06:16:24.058 align:start position:0%
Initiative for our economy we could
 
06:16:27.890 --> 06:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
either have me too legislation that is
 
06:16:29.510 --> 06:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
relatively similar to the states around
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
us and other states taken to account
 
06:16:33.410 --> 06:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
mistakes they've made and try to improve
 
06:16:37.208 --> 06:16:37.218 align:start position:0%
on them
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
and have good legislation
 
06:16:41.930 --> 06:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
we would um
 
06:16:44.448 --> 06:16:44.458 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the prosperity of
 
06:16:46.690 --> 06:16:46.700 align:start position:0%
the state by doing that
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
or we can lead
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
and have groundbreaking legislation
 
06:16:54.470 --> 06:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
that really accomplished a great deal
 
06:16:57.708 --> 06:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
and turbocharged our economy
 
06:16:57.718 --> 06:16:58.670 align:start position:0%
and turbocharged our economy
um

06:16:58.670 --> 06:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:01.368 --> 06:17:01.378 align:start position:0%
and created really a gold brush for this
 
06:17:04.208 --> 06:17:04.218 align:start position:0%
state and for its residents
 
06:17:08.510 --> 06:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:08.520 --> 06:17:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:17:11.150 --> 06:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:14.090 --> 06:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
one thing that I think people may be
 
06:17:17.750 --> 06:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
aware of is that certainly in the in the
 
06:17:20.510 --> 06:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
Cannabis economy there are obviously
 
06:17:23.628 --> 06:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
jobs and prosperity and revenue that
 
06:17:25.368 --> 06:17:25.378 align:start position:0%
will be created by people who actually
 
06:17:27.230 --> 06:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
handle a plant they
 
06:17:30.048 --> 06:17:30.058 align:start position:0%
run dispensaries they manufacture they
 
06:17:31.970 --> 06:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
cultivate they distribute they test
 
06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
product and so on
 
06:17:36.770 --> 06:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
but what has happened in the Cannabis
 
06:17:38.208 --> 06:17:38.218 align:start position:0%
industry and I think that happens in a
 
06:17:40.730 --> 06:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
lot of other Industries is that that
 
06:17:44.810 --> 06:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
core activity is supported by a a
 
06:17:48.190 --> 06:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly wide range of
 
06:17:50.650 --> 06:17:50.660 align:start position:0%
vendors professionals
 
06:17:54.048 --> 06:17:54.058 align:start position:0%
service providers they can be attorneys
 
06:17:55.850 --> 06:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
they could be CPAs they could be people
 
06:17:58.368 --> 06:17:58.378 align:start position:0%
who build social media people who sell
 
06:18:01.490 --> 06:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
equipment people who sell soil build
 
06:18:04.690 --> 06:18:04.700 align:start position:0%
greenhouses construction professionals
 
06:18:08.330 --> 06:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
so the more robust a cannabis economy
 
06:18:12.650 --> 06:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
that we encourage and that we enable the
 
06:18:14.930 --> 06:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
more robust many many other sectors of
 
06:18:17.810 --> 06:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
the economy will become
 
06:18:17.820 --> 06:18:20.448 align:start position:0%
the economy will become
um

06:18:20.448 --> 06:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of little details on the bill
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's proposed which the New Hampshire
 
06:18:28.570 --> 06:18:28.580 align:start position:0%
cannabis party fully supports
 
06:18:30.830 --> 06:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
several of the people who spoke before
 
06:18:32.930 --> 06:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
me including
 
06:18:35.810 --> 06:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
um uh leader Osborne um you know
 
06:18:37.970 --> 06:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was a significant
 
06:18:40.490 --> 06:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
Coalition and collaboration in producing
 
06:18:42.530 --> 06:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
06:18:46.910 --> 06:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
um of of which I had some input also and
 
06:18:50.448 --> 06:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
I think that it represents a very very
 
06:18:53.090 --> 06:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
good start on Smart Common Sense
 
06:18:56.628 --> 06:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:58.190 --> 06:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
um but a couple of little things on the
 
06:18:59.628 --> 06:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
bill just to take a note of that's
 
06:19:01.368 --> 06:19:01.378 align:start position:0%
already in there
 
06:19:01.378 --> 06:19:02.470 align:start position:0%
already in there
um

06:19:02.470 --> 06:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:04.970 --> 06:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
one is that it makes reference to
 
06:19:07.030 --> 06:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis seeds
 
06:19:09.708 --> 06:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
roughly several months ago maybe four
 
06:19:11.930 --> 06:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
six months ago the DEA there was a
 
06:19:13.490 --> 06:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
significant amount of confusion as to
 
06:19:15.410 --> 06:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
whether cannabis seeds and hemp seeds or
 
06:19:17.208 --> 06:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
whether they were cannabis whether they
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
were hemp how they should be regulated
 
06:19:21.530 --> 06:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
the DEA came out with a very very clear
 
06:19:24.170 --> 06:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
guidance several months ago that said
 
06:19:26.510 --> 06:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
that all seeds cannabis or hemp are
 
06:19:29.750 --> 06:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise were going to be treated as
 
06:19:33.470 --> 06:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
hemp and regulated as hemp and I think
 
06:19:34.850 --> 06:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
that was actually
 
06:19:34.860 --> 06:19:36.410 align:start position:0%
that was actually
um

06:19:36.410 --> 06:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
um a pretty rational and good approach
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
to that and it has created a significant
 
06:19:43.070 --> 06:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
amount of order in the marketplace my
 
06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to do the same
 
06:19:48.110 --> 06:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
thing and not to try to put cannabis
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
seeds which contain no THC
 
06:19:52.490 --> 06:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
um into the same pocket as cannabis and
 
06:19:54.350 --> 06:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
regulate it that way because the market
 
06:19:56.570 --> 06:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
is really actually beginning to pick up
 
06:19:58.010 --> 06:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
some speed
 
06:20:00.170 --> 06:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
um and and there's really doesn't seem
 
06:20:02.030 --> 06:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
to be any downside it's all just kind of
 
06:20:04.310 --> 06:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
a good positive thing
 
06:20:04.320 --> 06:20:06.230 align:start position:0%
a good positive thing
um

06:20:06.230 --> 06:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:08.030 --> 06:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
there's also um
 
06:20:09.770 --> 06:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
Provisions in this particular
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
legislation for tracking inventory and
 
06:20:15.010 --> 06:20:15.020 align:start position:0%
for close regulation of cannabis
 
06:20:18.350 --> 06:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of the close
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
tracking of money and inventory is as a
 
06:20:25.010 --> 06:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
result of the fact that um
 
06:20:27.948 --> 06:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
it's uh there's still Federal
 
06:20:32.390 --> 06:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
prohibition on cannabis uh you know
 
06:20:37.430 --> 06:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis entirely and that in 2014 the
 
06:20:39.230 --> 06:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
U.S department of the treasury came out
 
06:20:43.730 --> 06:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
with guidelines for banks and for um for
 
06:20:45.250 --> 06:20:45.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis operators
 
06:20:47.510 --> 06:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to navigate
 
06:20:47.520 --> 06:20:49.788 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to navigate
legally

06:20:49.788 --> 06:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
legally
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
um the compliance issues that are
 
06:20:53.810 --> 06:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
created by that tension between federal
 
06:20:56.270 --> 06:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
and state law and the only reason I
 
06:20:59.810 --> 06:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
mentioned that is because at this
 
06:21:02.330 --> 06:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
particular point that type of Regulation
 
06:21:05.510 --> 06:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
and that close tracking of the money and
 
06:21:09.770 --> 06:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
of the inventory is a necessary uh
 
06:21:11.810 --> 06:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I'd call it an evil
 
06:21:13.430 --> 06:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
but it's def definitely a necessary
 
06:21:15.770 --> 06:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
component to navigate through the
 
06:21:17.628 --> 06:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
tension between state and federal law
 
06:21:21.110 --> 06:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
but it would be very important that we
 
06:21:24.288 --> 06:21:24.298 align:start position:0%
sunsetted a certain amount of that
 
06:21:24.298 --> 06:21:25.128 align:start position:0%
sunsetted a certain amount of that
um

06:21:25.128 --> 06:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:29.690 --> 06:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
pretty rigorous tracking of money and
 
06:21:32.150 --> 06:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
inventory when Federal prohibition is
 
06:21:36.708 --> 06:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
over in the same sense that that type of
 
06:21:39.230 --> 06:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
Regulation was lifted and eased when
 
06:21:42.110 --> 06:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
hemp became legal and became no longer a
 
06:21:42.120 --> 06:21:42.708 align:start position:0%
hemp became legal and became no longer a
um

06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:42.718 --> 06:21:43.570 align:start position:0%
um
a

06:21:43.570 --> 06:21:43.580 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:21:46.310 --> 06:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
federally scheduled narcotic right now
 
06:21:48.730 --> 06:21:48.740 align:start position:0%
the the regulation over hemp is largely
 
06:21:52.128 --> 06:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
concerned about making sure that people
 
06:21:54.890 --> 06:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
selling hemp and hemp related products
 
06:21:58.788 --> 06:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
stay in an arbitrary sandbox of less
 
06:22:02.150 --> 06:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
than 0.3 percent THC and of course it's
 
06:22:04.310 --> 06:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually all really the same plant but
 
06:22:06.048 --> 06:22:06.058 align:start position:0%
at this particular moment because hemp
 
06:22:07.610 --> 06:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
has been carved out by that definition
 
06:22:11.090 --> 06:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
as being different a lot of the the
 
06:22:14.868 --> 06:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
regulatory obligations of
 
06:22:17.570 --> 06:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
um of anyone in the hemp or cannabis
 
06:22:19.510 --> 06:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
business or um
 
06:22:22.250 --> 06:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
all of the anti-money laundering and
 
06:22:24.650 --> 06:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
careful tracking of inventory and money
 
06:22:27.110 --> 06:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
has fallen by the wayside when the
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
federal prohibition on hemp ended
 
06:22:30.890 --> 06:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
um and I I think it would be important
 
06:22:30.900 --> 06:22:31.910 align:start position:0%
um and I I think it would be important
to

06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:22:34.750 --> 06:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
um relax that also on cannabis
 
06:22:37.250 --> 06:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
when Federal prohibition is over and
 
06:22:38.750 --> 06:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
these are just little details about the
 
06:22:40.970 --> 06:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
bill um what I actually want to talk
 
06:22:43.548 --> 06:22:43.558 align:start position:0%
about more and which I think is a lot
 
06:22:45.650 --> 06:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
more compelling is what's not in the
 
06:22:48.230 --> 06:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill and probably should be
 
06:22:48.240 --> 06:22:49.368 align:start position:0%
bill and probably should be
um

06:22:49.368 --> 06:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
but a couple of other things that um you
 
06:22:55.070 --> 06:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
know are in the Bill one is that I think
 
06:22:58.128 --> 06:22:58.138 align:start position:0%
that there's a strong uh sentiment on a
 
06:23:00.288 --> 06:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
lot on the part of a number of policy
 
06:23:03.590 --> 06:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
makers to have no cap on licenses
 
06:23:06.470 --> 06:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire as part of this bill
 
06:23:08.930 --> 06:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
um and I've had conversations with
 
06:23:11.930 --> 06:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
several leading lawmakers on that
 
06:23:13.910 --> 06:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and at this particular moment it
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
would not be a good idea to do that
 
06:23:22.010 --> 06:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
right away because it creates chaos in
 
06:23:24.350 --> 06:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
the marketplace it creates a glut of
 
06:23:26.990 --> 06:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
product that people can't really make a
 
06:23:29.510 --> 06:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
profit on it and they are very tempted
 
06:23:31.368 --> 06:23:31.378 align:start position:0%
to enter the black market and start
 
06:23:33.430 --> 06:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
selling it all over the place
 
06:23:35.930 --> 06:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
and there's a provision in the bill for
 
06:23:39.350 --> 06:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
labeling testing and child proof
 
06:23:41.208 --> 06:23:41.218 align:start position:0%
packaging and education and so on and
 
06:23:42.410 --> 06:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's very good
 
06:23:44.990 --> 06:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm being asked to speed it up so
 
06:23:47.390 --> 06:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
let me let me just mention a couple of
 
06:23:50.090 --> 06:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
very quick important points that are not
 
06:23:54.048 --> 06:23:54.058 align:start position:0%
in the bill one is that we should
 
06:23:55.670 --> 06:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
encourage and incentivize through
 
06:23:58.610 --> 06:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
Economic Development and tax incentives
 
06:24:00.830 --> 06:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
um public-private Partnerships between
 
06:24:04.310 --> 06:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
business and our AG universities for
 
06:24:07.010 --> 06:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
research this will create a lot of very
 
06:24:09.948 --> 06:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
good jobs likewise for pharmaceutical
 
06:24:14.030 --> 06:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
research likewise for technology an
 
06:24:15.590 --> 06:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
example of Technology would be
 
06:24:17.810 --> 06:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
developing a sobriety test which
 
06:24:20.570 --> 06:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough I was organizing an
 
06:24:22.128 --> 06:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
event a few months ago before the
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
election where we were going to bring in
 
06:24:25.548 --> 06:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
a number of different Business Leaders
 
06:24:28.010 --> 06:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
and so on and two there are two
 
06:24:30.048 --> 06:24:30.058 align:start position:0%
companies one in um on the west coast
 
06:24:33.410 --> 06:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
and one in Canada on the west coast that
 
06:24:36.288 --> 06:24:36.298 align:start position:0%
have developed uh effective sobriety
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
tests and for example encouraging them
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
to maybe establish operations in New
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be a good thing
 
06:24:44.448 --> 06:24:44.458 align:start position:0%
um but the other two things that I think
 
06:24:46.368 --> 06:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
are most important and most compelling
 
06:24:49.610 --> 06:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
I've saved for last one is that um as
 
06:24:52.250 --> 06:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sure most of you guys know
 
06:24:56.030 --> 06:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
um if you are a user of marijuana
 
06:24:58.430 --> 06:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
um you uh have to disclose that on a
 
06:25:01.788 --> 06:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
Firearms transaction uh form
 
06:25:04.128 --> 06:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
um and if you lie about it which most
 
06:25:05.750 --> 06:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
people do
 
06:25:08.930 --> 06:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
um you are obliged when exercising your
 
06:25:11.510 --> 06:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected
 
06:25:13.490 --> 06:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
um Second Amendment rights you are
 
06:25:15.948 --> 06:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
obliged to commit a federal crime in
 
06:25:18.368 --> 06:25:18.378 align:start position:0%
order to proceed with that transaction
 
06:25:22.910 --> 06:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
that is something that we can and we
 
06:25:26.690 --> 06:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
should fix when we put together cannabis
 
06:25:29.750 --> 06:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation it's completely doable and
 
06:25:32.930 --> 06:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
we can protect these citizens and
 
06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire from
 
06:25:36.830 --> 06:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution and
 
06:25:39.708 --> 06:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
um and any adverse consequences
 
06:25:43.128 --> 06:25:43.138 align:start position:0%
um with that and I will say that I think
 
06:25:46.430 --> 06:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
that anyone who really supports that is
 
06:25:49.730 --> 06:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
likely to make themselves the darling of
 
06:25:51.770 --> 06:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment constituent in
 
06:25:54.230 --> 06:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
constituencies in this state and
 
06:25:54.240 --> 06:25:55.570 align:start position:0%
constituencies in this state and
nationally

06:25:55.570 --> 06:25:55.580 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be doing the
 
06:26:00.830 --> 06:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
citizens and residents of New Hampshire
 
06:26:03.350 --> 06:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
a great service and it would also I
 
06:26:06.770 --> 06:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
think be the kind of thing that it would
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
be important to support the other thing
 
06:26:11.448 --> 06:26:11.458 align:start position:0%
is that what we can do is there is
 
06:26:13.670 --> 06:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
actually no federal prohibition on
 
06:26:15.910 --> 06:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce
 
06:26:18.650 --> 06:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
the Constitution gives Congress the
 
06:26:20.570 --> 06:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
right to regulate interstate commerce
 
06:26:23.150 --> 06:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
but they are not regulating it as
 
06:26:25.548 --> 06:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
regards cannabis at this point however
 
06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
in deference to that every state so far
 
06:26:31.128 --> 06:26:31.138 align:start position:0%
that has legalized cannabis has put into
 
06:26:34.610 --> 06:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
their law that interstate and you know
 
06:26:36.708 --> 06:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce is prohibited but
 
06:26:39.170 --> 06:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
the prohibition does not in fact emanate
 
06:26:41.208 --> 06:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
from the feds it emanates from the
 
06:26:43.910 --> 06:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
individual states that prohibited
 
06:26:46.070 --> 06:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
um if we were
 
06:26:48.650 --> 06:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
to allow interstate commerce and
 
06:26:51.890 --> 06:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
international Commerce we would open a
 
06:26:55.010 --> 06:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
open up a Floodgate Of investment and
 
06:26:57.110 --> 06:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
prosperity for New Hampshire and we
 
06:26:58.810 --> 06:26:58.820 align:start position:0%
would be leading the nation with that
 
06:27:01.670 --> 06:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is also doable
 
06:27:03.850 --> 06:27:03.860 align:start position:0%
um it's doable legally
 
06:27:07.250 --> 06:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
and you know it would really it would
 
06:27:08.690 --> 06:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
create a situation in New Hampshire
 
06:27:11.990 --> 06:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
where we would have a an incredible Boon
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
as a result of this legislation
 
06:27:17.448 --> 06:27:17.458 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to mention only uh in
 
06:27:19.070 --> 06:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
the context of that this is essentially
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
in support of 639 just to comment on on
 
06:27:27.708 --> 06:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
544 that uh you know 544 is the
 
06:27:29.448 --> 06:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
antithesis of that that tends to
 
06:27:32.448 --> 06:27:32.458 align:start position:0%
suffocate Commerce uh with uh having the
 
06:27:34.910 --> 06:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
liquor Authority as the sole distributor
 
06:27:35.868 --> 06:27:35.878 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:27:38.390 --> 06:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
um and it would also channel that
 
06:27:40.970 --> 06:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
suffocated Commerce to a very narrow
 
06:27:43.310 --> 06:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
band of beneficiaries rather than
 
06:27:46.128 --> 06:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
broadly in the state anyway that's
 
06:27:49.368 --> 06:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say for any questions
 
06:27:51.410 --> 06:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:27:54.410 --> 06:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
I think we're all set
 
06:27:59.208 --> 06:27:59.218 align:start position:0%
chair Colin Kaylee Glenn
 
06:28:10.010 --> 06:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:12.890 --> 06:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
there we go okay hello everyone
 
06:28:14.448 --> 06:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair thank you committee
 
06:28:16.010 --> 06:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
for being here on the snowy day to
 
06:28:17.448 --> 06:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
listen to me
 
06:28:19.548 --> 06:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
um I'm Haley mcglenn I'm a 16 year old
 
06:28:22.128 --> 06:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
senior at Raymond High School and I'm
 
06:28:23.628 --> 06:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
here to offer a perspective that
 
06:28:26.270 --> 06:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise might have gone unseen with
 
06:28:27.670 --> 06:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
everyone else here
 
06:28:29.868 --> 06:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
so Through The Eyes of a high school
 
06:28:32.030 --> 06:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
student in 2023
 
06:28:34.490 --> 06:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
I park my car in the student parking lot
 
06:28:37.128 --> 06:28:37.138 align:start position:0%
and walk in try to ignore be it
 
06:28:38.628 --> 06:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
overwhelming whiff of marijuana
 
06:28:40.670 --> 06:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
emanating from the cars in the next row
 
06:28:43.490 --> 06:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
over I've told administrators before but
 
06:28:45.708 --> 06:28:45.718 align:start position:0%
nothing has been done so now I just keep
 
06:28:45.718 --> 06:28:46.788 align:start position:0%
nothing has been done so now I just keep
walking

06:28:46.788 --> 06:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
walking
 
06:28:49.548 --> 06:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
flag one the adult complacency regarding
 
06:28:51.650 --> 06:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
the use of the substance have paved a
 
06:28:53.570 --> 06:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
path for our youth to be desensitized
 
06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
from the danger of this drug this was a
 
06:28:58.430 --> 06:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
place of learning
 
06:29:00.590 --> 06:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
it is early Monday morning and I walk
 
06:29:03.410 --> 06:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
into my block one class the girl I sit
 
06:29:04.990 --> 06:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
next to is stoned out of her mind
 
06:29:07.070 --> 06:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
giggling to herself
 
06:29:08.990 --> 06:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
she looks over me and slurred and
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
incoherently says it's fine oh my God I
 
06:29:15.230 --> 06:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
just had a little bit of my mom's stuff
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:20.090 --> 06:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
I look over nervously and try to make
 
06:29:22.610 --> 06:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
some sense out of what I just heard
 
06:29:25.430 --> 06:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
flag too kids and adults are not mature
 
06:29:26.868 --> 06:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
enough to understand the effects of
 
06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana and are too overcome by the
 
06:29:30.770 --> 06:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
high it provides so that's just another
 
06:29:32.570 --> 06:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
06:29:34.910 --> 06:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
I wait until 9 30 to use the bathroom
 
06:29:36.890 --> 06:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's usually when all the girls clear
 
06:29:39.288 --> 06:29:39.298 align:start position:0%
out from their first hangout session and
 
06:29:40.990 --> 06:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
to my disappointment they're still there
 
06:29:44.570 --> 06:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
as I wash my hands they are all silent
 
06:29:46.670 --> 06:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I turn to the sink and one of them
 
06:29:49.548 --> 06:29:49.558 align:start position:0%
speaks you better not tell right I'll
 
06:29:51.048 --> 06:29:51.058 align:start position:0%
give you a hit
 
06:29:53.390 --> 06:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
she hands me a dab pen and I politely
 
06:29:53.400 --> 06:29:54.470 align:start position:0%
she hands me a dab pen and I politely
decline

06:29:54.470 --> 06:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
decline
 
06:29:57.650 --> 06:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
whatever but you better not tell still
 
06:29:59.448 --> 06:29:59.458 align:start position:0%
I turn off the water
 
06:30:01.970 --> 06:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
yeah sure you're entitled to ruining
 
06:30:03.110 --> 06:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
your own life
 
06:30:05.448 --> 06:30:05.458 align:start position:0%
but then I remembered She's Not Just
 
06:30:07.490 --> 06:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
ruining her own life
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
is ruining the but these are my peers
 
06:30:11.690 --> 06:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
and this is the generation of our future
 
06:30:11.700 --> 06:30:13.010 align:start position:0%
and this is the generation of our future
Society

06:30:13.010 --> 06:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
Society
 
06:30:15.890 --> 06:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
flag four if this doesn't scare you what
 
06:30:15.900 --> 06:30:18.650 align:start position:0%
flag four if this doesn't scare you what
does

06:30:18.650 --> 06:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:20.570 --> 06:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
I want to be able to walk through the
 
06:30:22.128 --> 06:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
student parking lot and smell nothing
 
06:30:24.830 --> 06:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
but cold New England air I want our
 
06:30:26.628 --> 06:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
youth to walk into their block one class
 
06:30:28.730 --> 06:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
and sit next to a conscious and coherent
 
06:30:31.368 --> 06:30:31.378 align:start position:0%
classmate our kids need to be able to
 
06:30:33.048 --> 06:30:33.058 align:start position:0%
use the bathroom without fear Judgment
 
06:30:35.750 --> 06:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
of tattling due to illicit and illegal
 
06:30:38.330 --> 06:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
activities on school grounds when did
 
06:30:40.548 --> 06:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
the bathroom become synonymous with drug
 
06:30:40.558 --> 06:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
the bathroom become synonymous with drug
use

06:30:41.990 --> 06:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:30:44.030 --> 06:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
sadly many of my peers have not
 
06:30:46.190 --> 06:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
responded have not received the crucial
 
06:30:47.930 --> 06:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
support that from the adults in their
 
06:30:50.448 --> 06:30:50.458 align:start position:0%
life but they can with their help
 
06:30:52.490 --> 06:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
take the time to talk to the teens
 
06:30:54.470 --> 06:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
around you and be the adult they can go
 
06:30:56.948 --> 06:30:56.958 align:start position:0%
to but either way
 
06:31:00.650 --> 06:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
hb639 cannot be passed without exposing
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
the youth to these dangers of this drug
 
06:31:06.350 --> 06:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
And in regards to previous testimony the
 
06:31:08.330 --> 06:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
government the governor's youth
 
06:31:10.610 --> 06:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
advisement Council and kid Governor pay
 
06:31:12.288 --> 06:31:12.298 align:start position:0%
attention to the laws being put into
 
06:31:12.298 --> 06:31:13.368 align:start position:0%
attention to the laws being put into
place

06:31:13.368 --> 06:31:13.378 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:31:15.170 --> 06:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that myself today is a
 
06:31:16.850 --> 06:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
very obvious example that the youth pay
 
06:31:18.708 --> 06:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
attention to what is happening in our
 
06:31:20.330 --> 06:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
big enforcement and going on with the
 
06:31:21.708 --> 06:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
laws today

afternoon

06:33:07.750 --> 06:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:33:10.610 --> 06:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me I just want to thank you all
 
06:33:12.110 --> 06:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
for volunteering your time to be here
 
06:33:15.048 --> 06:33:15.058 align:start position:0%
today also um I know what it's like to
 
06:33:16.730 --> 06:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
volunteer and uh
 
06:33:18.650 --> 06:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
sometimes that commitment can be very
 
06:33:21.590 --> 06:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
time consuming I want to clear up a few
 
06:33:23.230 --> 06:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
things that I heard today
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
first of all it's our state constitution
 
06:33:28.910 --> 06:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
not the Federal Constitution that is
 
06:33:31.128 --> 06:33:31.138 align:start position:0%
what we're Guided by
 
06:33:34.548 --> 06:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
second Edibles are not 90 most are not
 
06:33:36.948 --> 06:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
more than 20 percent and you cannot die
 
06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
from eating marijuana
 
06:33:42.048 --> 06:33:42.058 align:start position:0%
as much as that is
 
06:33:45.890 --> 06:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
expressed it's an impossibility
 
06:33:47.390 --> 06:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
um you know the state is concerned about
 
06:33:49.490 --> 06:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
the legalization of cannabis yet we
 
06:33:51.350 --> 06:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
expanded one of the most addictive drugs
 
06:33:52.910 --> 06:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
on the planet which a state holds
 
06:33:55.368 --> 06:33:55.378 align:start position:0%
Monopoly on alcohol
 
06:33:57.410 --> 06:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
we've expanded that into some of the
 
06:34:00.170 --> 06:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable communities in America
 
06:34:02.570 --> 06:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
the lowest income they are the most
 
06:34:04.910 --> 06:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
susceptible to addiction except this
 
06:34:06.830 --> 06:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
state when we spend like 70 million
 
06:34:10.270 --> 06:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
bucks to expand our alcohol distribution
 
06:34:12.708 --> 06:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
that made sense right
 
06:34:14.990 --> 06:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
there that had no negative impact on
 
06:34:16.970 --> 06:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
those communities right
 
06:34:19.070 --> 06:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought
 
06:34:19.080 --> 06:34:21.170 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought
anyways

06:34:21.170 --> 06:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
06:34:23.330 --> 06:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
but we fall back and the devil's lettuce
 
06:34:26.810 --> 06:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
is an impossibility to legalize
 
06:34:29.930 --> 06:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
accept the impacts of it are a lot less
 
06:34:32.150 --> 06:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
impactful you know I've never seen
 
06:34:34.128 --> 06:34:34.138 align:start position:0%
somebody or or heard from a police
 
06:34:37.250 --> 06:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
officer or anybody expressed this
 
06:34:39.650 --> 06:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
I've seen them beat their wife
 
06:34:40.970 --> 06:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
what do you mean
 
06:34:43.128 --> 06:34:43.138 align:start position:0%
when they consumed alcohol
 
06:34:45.890 --> 06:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
never under the influence of marijuana
 
06:34:47.690 --> 06:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
alone oh wait a minute they might beat
 
06:34:49.190 --> 06:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
them to the fridge to get the better
 
06:34:52.368 --> 06:34:52.378 align:start position:0%
Munchies that'll be the extent of the
 
06:34:54.170 --> 06:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
violence that is portrayed from the
 
06:34:58.490 --> 06:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:01.250 --> 06:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
legalization gives us control
 
06:35:03.288 --> 06:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
you know you all worry about
 
06:35:05.150 --> 06:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and the 20 other things I'm
 
06:35:06.890 --> 06:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
going to State something I'm a recovered
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
addict I just put a gram of heroin at my
 
06:35:11.448 --> 06:35:11.458 align:start position:0%
nose a day
 
06:35:13.250 --> 06:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
you know what got me off of that
 
06:35:13.260 --> 06:35:14.570 align:start position:0%
you know what got me off of that
cannabis

06:35:14.570 --> 06:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
06:35:15.970 --> 06:35:15.980 align:start position:0%
you know what straighten my life out
 
06:35:18.350 --> 06:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis and you're all looking going
 
06:35:19.910 --> 06:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
what how
 
06:35:21.948 --> 06:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
here's some tidbits for you I'm the vice
 
06:35:23.448 --> 06:35:23.458 align:start position:0%
chair of the planning board in Bristol
 
06:35:25.128 --> 06:35:25.138 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of the CIP committee I'm
 
06:35:27.650 --> 06:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
on the downtown committee I am also on
 
06:35:30.530 --> 06:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Management committee
 
06:35:33.230 --> 06:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
is the icing of the cake I'm running for
 
06:35:35.270 --> 06:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
vice chair the New Hampshire GOP
 
06:35:38.628 --> 06:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
why because of this narrow-mindedness
 
06:35:41.208 --> 06:35:41.218 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely absurd this just ices
 
06:35:43.730 --> 06:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
the cake to some of it that I see
 
06:35:45.530 --> 06:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
we need to open our minds in this state
 
06:35:47.990 --> 06:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
to a lot of things
 
06:35:50.090 --> 06:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
once again we'll expand the alcohol
 
06:35:53.628 --> 06:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
distribution by 70 million bucks but the
 
06:35:56.570 --> 06:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:00.288 --> 06:36:00.298 align:start position:0%
I heard some talk about how
 
06:36:02.330 --> 06:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
statistics are showing there's more
 
06:36:05.690 --> 06:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
accidents in Colorado and stuff
 
06:36:07.910 --> 06:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
if someone would have stuck around so I
 
06:36:09.530 --> 06:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
could have questioned them if you look
 
06:36:11.150 --> 06:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
at those statistics when you start out
 
06:36:13.490 --> 06:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
at zero
 
06:36:16.128 --> 06:36:16.138 align:start position:0%
and then you build those statistics what
 
06:36:17.750 --> 06:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you think is going to happen they
 
06:36:21.110 --> 06:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
didn't test for marijuana use prior to
 
06:36:23.570 --> 06:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
its legalization
 
06:36:26.090 --> 06:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
and marijuana can be in your system for
 
06:36:28.368 --> 06:36:28.378 align:start position:0%
30 days 30 days
 
06:36:31.548 --> 06:36:31.558 align:start position:0%
so they could test it no not an inkling
 
06:36:33.830 --> 06:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the world on whether that marijuana
 
06:36:37.548 --> 06:36:37.558 align:start position:0%
consumption caused that accident that's
 
06:36:40.510 --> 06:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:43.310 --> 06:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
gateway drug my parents never had a
 
06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis cabinet that's what I'm going
 
06:36:48.530 --> 06:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
to say okay there was never any cannabis
 
06:36:52.010 --> 06:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:52.020 --> 06:36:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
alcohol

06:36:53.330 --> 06:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
06:36:55.190 --> 06:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's what got
 
06:36:58.430 --> 06:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
me on the road to addiction alcohol
 
06:37:00.708 --> 06:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
but yet the state expanded it by 70
 
06:37:01.970 --> 06:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
million bucks
 
06:37:04.330 --> 06:37:04.340 align:start position:0%
imagine that huh
 
06:37:07.310 --> 06:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
and there's ridiculous
 
06:37:10.730 --> 06:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
suggestion that ER visits will will and
 
06:37:13.190 --> 06:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
have increased that's because we've
 
06:37:15.110 --> 06:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
softened Society to the point of
 
06:37:15.120 --> 06:37:16.788 align:start position:0%
softened Society to the point of
victimhood

06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
victimhood
 
06:37:19.970 --> 06:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
everybody runs to the to the emergency
 
06:37:23.090 --> 06:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
room if they waited 15 minutes they'll
 
06:37:25.070 --> 06:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
be okay because that's the only thing
 
06:37:27.110 --> 06:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
that comes from over consumption of
 
06:37:29.750 --> 06:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis is feeling uncomfortable
 
06:37:31.850 --> 06:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
06:37:33.590 --> 06:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
15 minutes you're done that's why they
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
can't get a test score
 
06:37:38.510 --> 06:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
DUI for cannabis because if I sit by the
 
06:37:40.430 --> 06:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
time I sit on the road 10 minutes later
 
06:37:42.708 --> 06:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
I'm ready to rock and roll down the road
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
because 90 of the high that I consumed
 
06:37:48.470 --> 06:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
prior to being stopped is gone 15 20
 
06:37:50.390 --> 06:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
minutes half an hour later
 
06:37:50.400 --> 06:37:51.830 align:start position:0%
minutes half an hour later
tops

06:37:51.830 --> 06:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
tops
 
06:37:55.070 --> 06:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's absurd the 1956 mentality that we
 
06:37:57.708 --> 06:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
apply to this it's not what we think it
 
06:37:57.718 --> 06:37:58.850 align:start position:0%
apply to this it's not what we think it
is

06:37:58.850 --> 06:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:38:00.948 --> 06:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
I have Lyme disease
 
06:38:02.810 --> 06:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
you know what that cures
 
06:38:05.690 --> 06:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think you understand the
 
06:38:08.868 --> 06:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
benefits of cannabis for those who have
 
06:38:11.810 --> 06:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:14.868 --> 06:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's off the charts and we talked about
 
06:38:14.878 --> 06:38:16.910 align:start position:0%
it's off the charts and we talked about
suicide

06:38:16.910 --> 06:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
06:38:18.708 --> 06:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
suicide was created by the covet
 
06:38:20.570 --> 06:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
lockdowns it wasn't created by the
 
06:38:22.910 --> 06:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
consumption of cannabis and I know how
 
06:38:24.110 --> 06:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
many veterans
 
06:38:28.670 --> 06:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
who have helped their help themselves to
 
06:38:30.110 --> 06:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
deal with this world because of the
 
06:38:32.448 --> 06:38:32.458 align:start position:0%
consumption of cannabis I could go on
 
06:38:34.430 --> 06:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
and on about this I just want this
 
06:38:35.690 --> 06:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
committee to know that I think we're
 
06:38:37.548 --> 06:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
thinking about all of this in such a
 
06:38:39.948 --> 06:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
1956 mentality
 
06:38:42.048 --> 06:38:42.058 align:start position:0%
and that's people there's actually
 
06:38:45.530 --> 06:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
people that can do this without ruining
 
06:38:47.270 --> 06:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
06:38:49.010 --> 06:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
how many people do you know has a casual
 
06:38:50.990 --> 06:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
drink every night
 
06:38:53.570 --> 06:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
they still exist right but if you smoke
 
06:38:56.110 --> 06:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
a joint
 
06:38:58.430 --> 06:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
you're Straight to Hell
 
06:39:00.350 --> 06:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's absurd
 
06:39:04.010 --> 06:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely absurd so please think
 
06:39:06.288 --> 06:39:06.298 align:start position:0%
about this in a logical manner think
 
06:39:08.690 --> 06:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
about the people who are innocent people
 
06:39:11.150 --> 06:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
like myself
 
06:39:13.610 --> 06:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
that can get arrested and have our whole
 
06:39:16.250 --> 06:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
Futures ruined or spend thousands of
 
06:39:19.548 --> 06:39:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:21.410 --> 06:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
do what
 
06:39:24.830 --> 06:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:27.890 --> 06:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
because the law says it's different
 
06:39:29.570 --> 06:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's absurd
 
06:39:31.610 --> 06:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
God bless New Hampshire God Bless
 
06:39:33.708 --> 06:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
America and God bless all of you thank
 
06:39:35.208 --> 06:39:35.218 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
06:39:41.390 --> 06:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:43.128 --> 06:39:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
06:39:44.990 --> 06:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
06:39:46.368 --> 06:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
Ross Connolly I'm the deputy state
 
06:39:48.890 --> 06:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity
 
06:39:51.530 --> 06:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
here to enthusiastically offer our
 
06:39:54.250 --> 06:39:54.260 align:start position:0%
support for HP 639
 
06:39:56.930 --> 06:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
as we've heard today New Hampshire is on
 
06:39:59.628 --> 06:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
an island of prohibition surrounded by
 
06:40:02.410 --> 06:40:02.420 align:start position:0%
States who have legalized for adult use
 
06:40:02.420 --> 06:40:04.270 align:start position:0%
States who have legalized for adult use
cannabis

06:40:04.270 --> 06:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
06:40:07.490 --> 06:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
although we are the last state in New
 
06:40:10.570 --> 06:40:10.580 align:start position:0%
England to look at doing this
 
06:40:13.010 --> 06:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity there to see
 
06:40:15.310 --> 06:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
learn lessons from the states around us
 
06:40:17.690 --> 06:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
and develop a uniquely New Hampshire
 
06:40:21.410 --> 06:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
system to address cannabis use
 
06:40:25.368 --> 06:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
uh and we think HP 639 does just that uh
 
06:40:27.410 --> 06:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
this legislation was developed uh
 
06:40:29.750 --> 06:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
through a diverse Coalition of groups
 
06:40:32.868 --> 06:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
from across the political Spectrum uh
 
06:40:34.850 --> 06:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
all getting their input
 
06:40:36.948 --> 06:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
um From afp's perspective we have three
 
06:40:38.810 --> 06:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
principles that we really look at when
 
06:40:42.230 --> 06:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
it comes to legalizing cannabis uh
 
06:40:45.230 --> 06:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
regulations on cultivators uh ensure the
 
06:40:47.390 --> 06:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
product goes through rigorous testing so
 
06:40:49.850 --> 06:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
consumers are safe from containments
 
06:40:52.910 --> 06:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh miners cannot access cannabis at
 
06:40:54.350 --> 06:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
retail stores
 
06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
and a system with minimal Taxation and
 
06:40:59.868 --> 06:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
barriers to entry is established to push
 
06:41:01.910 --> 06:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
out black market influence as much as
 
06:41:01.920 --> 06:41:03.650 align:start position:0%
out black market influence as much as
possible

06:41:03.650 --> 06:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:41:06.410 --> 06:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is if you are an
 
06:41:09.530 --> 06:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
adult in New Hampshire you can go and
 
06:41:11.150 --> 06:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
buy legal cannabis
 
06:41:14.030 --> 06:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
they're just going to other states to
 
06:41:16.788 --> 06:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
buy it and coming back here so any of
 
06:41:19.730 --> 06:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
the the arguments from opponents uh of
 
06:41:22.310 --> 06:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
some of the negative consequences we are
 
06:41:25.850 --> 06:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
either already seeing or they uh have
 
06:41:29.230 --> 06:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:31.670 --> 06:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
hb639 takes a balanced approach by
 
06:41:34.310 --> 06:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
providing oversight through a commission
 
06:41:37.250 --> 06:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
testing requirements for cultivators low
 
06:41:39.910 --> 06:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for retail stores
 
06:41:43.368 --> 06:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
this bill opposed to others takes a a
 
06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
different approach by Levy by expanding
 
06:41:49.070 --> 06:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax which is 8.5
 
06:41:52.510 --> 06:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
percent which would generate Revenue
 
06:41:54.890 --> 06:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
to tackle some New Hampshire's most
 
06:41:56.750 --> 06:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
pressing issues like paying off of a
 
06:41:58.850 --> 06:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
pension liability and reducing property
 
06:42:01.490 --> 06:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
taxes things that would benefit every
 
06:42:04.310 --> 06:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
Granite stator uh you know there's a
 
06:42:05.750 --> 06:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand plus Granite Staters
 
06:42:08.270 --> 06:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
that use cannabis but not everyone would
 
06:42:10.850 --> 06:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
obviously partake from a appease
 
06:42:12.410 --> 06:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
perspective we're not saying that this
 
06:42:14.690 --> 06:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
is a good thing and that everyone should
 
06:42:16.788 --> 06:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
do it we're saying that it happens
 
06:42:19.070 --> 06:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
people are using it they're buying it
 
06:42:22.548 --> 06:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
now and uh if if they choose to use it
 
06:42:24.830 --> 06:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
we should have a regulated market to
 
06:42:26.628 --> 06:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
make sure that the the product is safe
 
06:42:29.030 --> 06:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
but at the same time every Granite
 
06:42:32.208 --> 06:42:32.218 align:start position:0%
stator can benefit from it uh by by
 
06:42:34.310 --> 06:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
putting the revenue towards beneficial
 
06:42:40.010 --> 06:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:44.030 --> 06:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh we think uh one of the big keys in
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is private stores are are
 
06:42:48.288 --> 06:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
critical to the mission to establishing
 
06:42:50.448 --> 06:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
an industry that can effectively build
 
06:42:52.430 --> 06:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
up Supply and reduce black market
 
06:42:52.440 --> 06:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
up Supply and reduce black market
influence

06:42:53.750 --> 06:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
influence
 
06:42:55.430 --> 06:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
Granite State or Granite State
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
businesses who already operate highly
 
06:43:00.230 --> 06:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
regulated markets like alcohol and
 
06:43:02.990 --> 06:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco should be able to easily gain a
 
06:43:05.990 --> 06:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
license and safely sell cannabis to
 
06:43:06.000 --> 06:43:07.730 align:start position:0%
license and safely sell cannabis to
adults

06:43:07.730 --> 06:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
adults
 
06:43:10.850 --> 06:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
it's well past time for New Hampshire to
 
06:43:14.090 --> 06:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the reality that we're in
 
06:43:17.030 --> 06:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before any granite stator
 
06:43:19.610 --> 06:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
is purchase that wants to is purchasing
 
06:43:22.070 --> 06:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
it right now the only experience the the
 
06:43:24.170 --> 06:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
only example you need and I encourage
 
06:43:26.270 --> 06:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
everyone to do this is go down to
 
06:43:28.850 --> 06:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
tingsborough or to Maine whatever's
 
06:43:32.090 --> 06:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
closest to you and and Drive by one of
 
06:43:34.010 --> 06:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
the the legal cannabis retail stores
 
06:43:34.020 --> 06:43:35.470 align:start position:0%
the the legal cannabis retail stores
there's

06:43:35.470 --> 06:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
06:43:38.270 --> 06:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
the entire parking lot is full with New
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plates uh and then they're
 
06:43:42.288 --> 06:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
coming back here so we're basically
 
06:43:45.530 --> 06:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
exporting an entire industry to other
 
06:43:48.470 --> 06:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
states where we're letting them decide
 
06:43:50.330 --> 06:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
what the regulations are what the
 
06:43:53.150 --> 06:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
oversight is what the system of retail
 
06:43:55.788 --> 06:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
stores is and we get none of the
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
benefits a good example is in the state
 
06:44:01.490 --> 06:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
of Maine they do not require rigorous
 
06:44:03.830 --> 06:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
testing that's something that's in this
 
06:44:06.590 --> 06:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill to ensure that consumers are
 
06:44:08.990 --> 06:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
protected from heavy metals or other
 
06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and we believe New Hampshire in this
 
06:44:19.430 --> 06:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
this situation can out-compete our
 
06:44:21.890 --> 06:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
neighbors by setting up a uniquely New
 
06:44:24.410 --> 06:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire system that protects consumers
 
06:44:27.110 --> 06:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
minors and reduces the size and scope of
 
06:44:29.448 --> 06:44:29.458 align:start position:0%
government and and we believe that that
 
06:44:33.048 --> 06:44:33.058 align:start position:0%
proposal is HB 639 so we encourage the
 
06:44:34.850 --> 06:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee to move this bill ought to
 
06:44:36.770 --> 06:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
pass I'd be happy to take any questions
 
06:44:38.750 --> 06:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
06:44:41.448 --> 06:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative Amman has a question
 
06:44:42.890 --> 06:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
06:44:44.810 --> 06:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
06:44:46.670 --> 06:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
not to put you on the spot there's a
 
06:44:48.350 --> 06:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
section in here about Municipal
 
06:44:50.750 --> 06:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances it gives local municipalities
 
06:44:53.570 --> 06:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
the option to prohibit could you speak
 
06:44:55.548 --> 06:44:55.558 align:start position:0%
to that if you're comfortable because I
 
06:44:57.410 --> 06:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone's touched on that yet
 
06:45:00.048 --> 06:45:00.058 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
06:45:02.750 --> 06:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh it was difficult to
 
06:45:05.150 --> 06:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
hear you but I I think it was
 
06:45:08.510 --> 06:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
um the the municipal ordinances uh my
 
06:45:10.310 --> 06:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
understanding in the bill is you know
 
06:45:12.350 --> 06:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
planning board zoning boards they they
 
06:45:15.470 --> 06:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
can surely still decide whether uh wear
 
06:45:18.770 --> 06:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
a cannabis store is is to go in town I
 
06:45:20.090 --> 06:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
think that's reasonable there's a
 
06:45:22.548 --> 06:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
thousand foot limit to being close to
 
06:45:26.810 --> 06:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
any school and uh towns can vote to opt
 
06:45:30.288 --> 06:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
out to not allow a cannabis store or
 
06:45:32.448 --> 06:45:32.458 align:start position:0%
cultivation and cultivation or
 
06:45:36.048 --> 06:45:36.058 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility in their towns
 
06:45:38.208 --> 06:45:38.218 align:start position:0%
and and in our mind that's that's
 
06:45:41.690 --> 06:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh instead of an opt-in you
 
06:45:43.730 --> 06:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
know that that's uh pretty consistent
 
06:45:46.310 --> 06:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
with a lot of other Industries
 
06:45:48.048 --> 06:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
06:45:50.208 --> 06:45:50.218 align:start position:0%
I have one more card here for house
 
06:45:52.490 --> 06:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
bills 639 and the good news is I only
 
06:45:55.548 --> 06:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
got five for the next one
 
06:45:57.170 --> 06:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
06:46:01.128 --> 06:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
uh former former Commerce member Joe
 
06:46:01.138 --> 06:46:02.890 align:start position:0%
uh former former Commerce member Joe
Hannon

06:46:02.890 --> 06:46:02.900 align:start position:0%
Hannon
 
06:46:04.970 --> 06:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hi
 
06:46:06.770 --> 06:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
um I almost need theme music to come up
 
06:46:07.910 --> 06:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
here with that introduction so I
 
06:46:09.230 --> 06:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
06:46:10.730 --> 06:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to make this brief because I
 
06:46:12.230 --> 06:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
know it's the end but it probably won't
 
06:46:14.208 --> 06:46:14.218 align:start position:0%
be brief so I'll just warn you
 
06:46:15.948 --> 06:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
um stop me when you want
 
06:46:18.170 --> 06:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to start off by saying that
 
06:46:20.030 --> 06:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
the the story of the prohibition the
 
06:46:21.830 --> 06:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
failure of prohibition is one of the
 
06:46:23.510 --> 06:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
oldest stories in existence
 
06:46:25.490 --> 06:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
the former president of Mexico Vincente
 
06:46:27.830 --> 06:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
fox said uh prohibition didn't work in
 
06:46:29.208 --> 06:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
the guard Nevada and the in the Garden
 
06:46:32.208 --> 06:46:32.218 align:start position:0%
of Eden Adam ate the apple this is not a
 
06:46:33.350 --> 06:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
new problem we're experiencing
 
06:46:35.270 --> 06:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
prohibiting something is not necessarily
 
06:46:37.128 --> 06:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
going to stop people from doing it we
 
06:46:38.510 --> 06:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that there are young
 
06:46:40.850 --> 06:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
people that are using it in schools and
 
06:46:42.650 --> 06:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
it's it's a problem with adults and
 
06:46:45.830 --> 06:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
families these are not new things I've
 
06:46:47.510 --> 06:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
been recovering from substance use since
 
06:46:52.490 --> 06:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
1991 so it's about 30 plus 31 plus years
 
06:46:54.890 --> 06:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
um and I was a teenager when I stopped
 
06:46:57.048 --> 06:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
using uh illicit substances
 
06:46:58.730 --> 06:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
I went on to become a doctor took a step
 
06:47:00.590 --> 06:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
back became a legislator did okay in
 
06:47:04.368 --> 06:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
life but uh prohibition was one of the
 
06:47:06.350 --> 06:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
things that could have destroyed my life
 
06:47:07.850 --> 06:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
had I been arrested for a felony
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
conviction we've had several presidents
 
06:47:11.030 --> 06:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
that admitted to using cannabis and
 
06:47:12.830 --> 06:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
other harder substances
 
06:47:14.690 --> 06:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
no one got arrested or prosecuted or put
 
06:47:15.890 --> 06:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
in prison for it they became president
 
06:47:17.570 --> 06:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
of the United States
 
06:47:20.628 --> 06:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
although one didn't inhale his defense
 
06:47:20.638 --> 06:47:22.670 align:start position:0%
although one didn't inhale his defense
um

06:47:22.670 --> 06:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:24.650 --> 06:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
prohibition uh one of my favorite quotes
 
06:47:26.270 --> 06:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
about Prohibition was that it has
 
06:47:28.128 --> 06:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
brought nothing but trouble and my
 
06:47:29.330 --> 06:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
favorite part about that quote is who
 
06:47:30.890 --> 06:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
said it and it was Al Capone
 
06:47:33.288 --> 06:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
you know prohibition has brought more
 
06:47:35.390 --> 06:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
problems than the actual problems
 
06:47:37.548 --> 06:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
themselves now I'm not discounting the
 
06:47:39.650 --> 06:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
the problems with substance use I've
 
06:47:41.270 --> 06:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
experienced it firsthand I've worked in
 
06:47:42.468 --> 06:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
the recovery Community harm reduction
 
06:47:45.230 --> 06:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
communities I've been on uh so many
 
06:47:46.968 --> 06:47:46.978 align:start position:0%
commissions and panels and task forces
 
06:47:48.890 --> 06:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
that I can barely count I was one of the
 
06:47:50.750 --> 06:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
public members for the commission a few
 
06:47:52.010 --> 06:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
years ago to study the regulation and
 
06:47:54.548 --> 06:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
taxation of marijuana in 2018
 
06:47:57.890 --> 06:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
so I I do know about the dangers of any
 
06:47:59.690 --> 06:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
06:48:01.788 --> 06:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
but I remember as a State Rep you get to
 
06:48:03.110 --> 06:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
do some fancy things I got to go to an
 
06:48:04.910 --> 06:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
opening of a liquor store in Epping when
 
06:48:06.230 --> 06:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
it was a new store and the chairman I
 
06:48:07.788 --> 06:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
think was Malik at the time came and
 
06:48:09.708 --> 06:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
gave a speech about how we're selling
 
06:48:12.230 --> 06:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
responsible regulated product that we
 
06:48:13.548 --> 06:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
know what's in it no one's getting an
 
06:48:15.288 --> 06:48:15.298 align:start position:0%
adulterated product no one's getting you
 
06:48:17.090 --> 06:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
know unnecessarily sick or dying from it
 
06:48:19.368 --> 06:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
as a surprise whatever it was it was an
 
06:48:21.170 --> 06:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
amazing speech if you change the word
 
06:48:22.850 --> 06:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
cannabis to alcohol it would have been
 
06:48:24.890 --> 06:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
the same speech
 
06:48:27.048 --> 06:48:27.058 align:start position:0%
and I kind of wish I'd recorded it for
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
that reason but I didn't unfortunately
 
06:48:30.468 --> 06:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
but he did say so if you find him he's
 
06:48:32.628 --> 06:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
still around asking
 
06:48:32.638 --> 06:48:34.310 align:start position:0%
still around asking
um

06:48:34.310 --> 06:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:37.310 --> 06:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
we have a current system where we have a
 
06:48:39.410 --> 06:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
group that has a near Monopoly
 
06:48:41.690 --> 06:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
and they allow some small organizations
 
06:48:43.368 --> 06:48:43.378 align:start position:0%
to sell some of the product that they
 
06:48:45.650 --> 06:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
sell they have enforcers they collect
 
06:48:48.170 --> 06:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
money for uh the protection and
 
06:48:49.788 --> 06:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
oversight and the regulation of that
 
06:48:51.890 --> 06:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
industry and they they punish people
 
06:48:53.930 --> 06:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
they find them and maybe put some people
 
06:48:55.490 --> 06:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
in jail for not doing what they want
 
06:48:57.770 --> 06:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
them to do and you may know it as the
 
06:48:59.150 --> 06:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission it's based on a Model
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
that when I heard about this when I
 
06:49:02.750 --> 06:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
first sat in uh Commerce and they
 
06:49:04.310 --> 06:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussed the Liquor Commission how it
 
06:49:05.628 --> 06:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
runs how much money they made for the
 
06:49:07.430 --> 06:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
state which was amazing at the time it
 
06:49:09.048 --> 06:49:09.058 align:start position:0%
was three point some billion dollars for
 
06:49:10.310 --> 06:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire I'm like wow
 
06:49:11.868 --> 06:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
that's amazing every year to go no since
 
06:49:14.570 --> 06:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
1930 something I'm like okay it's a lot
 
06:49:17.330 --> 06:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
of money but that money could also be
 
06:49:19.968 --> 06:49:19.978 align:start position:0%
made in the in the private sector people
 
06:49:21.350 --> 06:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
could start their own businesses more
 
06:49:23.090 --> 06:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
money can be made tax money can be gone
 
06:49:25.788 --> 06:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
can be raised Revenue can be raised we
 
06:49:27.890 --> 06:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
have a drain of use in this state people
 
06:49:29.510 --> 06:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
are always complaining all the young
 
06:49:30.468 --> 06:49:30.478 align:start position:0%
people don't want to stay in New
 
06:49:31.548 --> 06:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we keep getting older people
 
06:49:33.410 --> 06:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm slowly becoming one of them I
 
06:49:35.330 --> 06:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
understand but
 
06:49:37.968 --> 06:49:37.978 align:start position:0%
this is one issue that will prevent that
 
06:49:39.288 --> 06:49:39.298 align:start position:0%
from happening not the only that's not
 
06:49:40.610 --> 06:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem but that is a
 
06:49:42.230 --> 06:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
big issue that can solve the problem I
 
06:49:44.270 --> 06:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
have nephews and nieces hey do you want
 
06:49:45.590 --> 06:49:45.600 align:start position:0%

06:49:49.310 --> 06:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
slopes but so do we
 
06:49:49.320 --> 06:49:50.448 align:start position:0%
slopes but so do we
um

06:49:50.448 --> 06:49:50.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
06:49:51.718 --> 06:49:52.730 align:start position:0%
let's see
um

06:49:52.730 --> 06:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:54.650 --> 06:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:49:56.810 --> 06:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
the other thing is you know
 
06:49:58.788 --> 06:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
since prohibition began drugs have
 
06:50:01.490 --> 06:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
become cheaper they're easier to get and
 
06:50:02.868 --> 06:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
they're more dangerous
 
06:50:04.850 --> 06:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
you know nothing is improved with
 
06:50:06.288 --> 06:50:06.298 align:start position:0%
prohibition you crack down on one
 
06:50:08.690 --> 06:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
substance it gets smaller they crack
 
06:50:09.770 --> 06:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
down on heroin they start making
 
06:50:11.390 --> 06:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
fentanyl it's easier to smuggle fentanyl
 
06:50:13.310 --> 06:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit heroin that much to get in
 
06:50:15.350 --> 06:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
for the same amount to get high from
 
06:50:17.090 --> 06:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
Cannabis everyone's like oh we're
 
06:50:19.190 --> 06:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
getting such higher concentrations these
 
06:50:21.230 --> 06:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
really serious levels of intoxicants to
 
06:50:22.730 --> 06:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
get people really sick
 
06:50:25.070 --> 06:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
I've seen liquor stores they sell grain
 
06:50:26.750 --> 06:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol in almost every liquor store in
 
06:50:28.250 --> 06:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
the state so it's not like they don't
 
06:50:30.288 --> 06:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
have almost Pure or close to Pure
 
06:50:32.390 --> 06:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol and it's the same thing with
 
06:50:34.430 --> 06:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis during alcohol prohibition and
 
06:50:36.350 --> 06:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
before alcohol prohibition back in in
 
06:50:37.490 --> 06:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
the day
 
06:50:39.708 --> 06:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
most alcohol out there was not nearly as
 
06:50:40.968 --> 06:50:40.978 align:start position:0%
strong as it was today it became
 
06:50:42.350 --> 06:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
stronger during prohibition because if
 
06:50:43.850 --> 06:50:43.860 align:start position:0%
you're going to get caught smuggling
 
06:50:45.110 --> 06:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
something or you have to smuggle
 
06:50:48.048 --> 06:50:48.058 align:start position:0%
something as heavy as alcohol you're
 
06:50:49.310 --> 06:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
going to try and make it more compact
 
06:50:50.570 --> 06:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
it's easier to get through the Border
 
06:50:52.010 --> 06:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's easier to sell it's easier to be
 
06:50:54.048 --> 06:50:54.058 align:start position:0%
sneaky about it it's the same thing with
 
06:50:55.250 --> 06:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
drugs and we've seen this with almost
 
06:50:57.288 --> 06:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
every type of drug from you know opium
 
06:50:59.390 --> 06:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
to methamphetamines it's been getting
 
06:51:01.368 --> 06:51:01.378 align:start position:0%
worse and worse because of prohibition
 
06:51:03.468 --> 06:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
now I'm not supporting I don't want
 
06:51:04.730 --> 06:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
anyone to go out and start doing this
 
06:51:06.288 --> 06:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
stuff I'm supporting legalization I'm
 
06:51:09.350 --> 06:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
supporting HP 639 I don't plan on
 
06:51:11.090 --> 06:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
smoking it if you see me smack it out of
 
06:51:13.070 --> 06:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
my hand I get my permission I don't want
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
to do it I'm not I don't want anyone
 
06:51:16.490 --> 06:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
else to be prohibited from doing it but
 
06:51:18.770 --> 06:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
the main reason is prohibition is the
 
06:51:20.868 --> 06:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
greater evil we've incarcerated people
 
06:51:23.690 --> 06:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
we've wasted countless lives resources
 
06:51:26.448 --> 06:51:26.458 align:start position:0%
and effort and I can guarantee that you
 
06:51:27.650 --> 06:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
know you're going to hear other bills
 
06:51:29.810 --> 06:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
every year ad nauseam the Commerce
 
06:51:31.010 --> 06:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
Committee too because now you're in on
 
06:51:32.990 --> 06:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
it welcome to the club this is going to
 
06:51:34.548 --> 06:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
be an annual occurrence you have to sit
 
06:51:36.530 --> 06:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
through for a long time this needs to be
 
06:51:38.750 --> 06:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
done the question has always asked why
 
06:51:40.190 --> 06:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know when is the time to legalize
 
06:51:42.410 --> 06:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
the time is a long time ago the time was
 
06:51:44.990 --> 06:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
never to do it and I hate the the term
 
06:51:47.208 --> 06:51:47.218 align:start position:0%
to legalize something we are
 
06:51:48.830 --> 06:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
re-legalizing something that was legal
 
06:51:50.570 --> 06:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
for many many years it was only made
 
06:51:53.690 --> 06:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
illegal in the 30s I believe slight uh
 
06:51:56.570 --> 06:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
lift of that from us velocity back in
 
06:51:58.190 --> 06:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
the late 60s and one year later they
 
06:51:59.628 --> 06:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
made it illegal again
 
06:52:02.448 --> 06:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
and what has it done it's ruined lives
 
06:52:04.690 --> 06:52:04.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you I'm begging you please
 
06:52:07.250 --> 06:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
help New Hampshire stop ruining lives
 
06:52:09.590 --> 06:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
and start the conversation so we can
 
06:52:11.510 --> 06:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
have safer interactions with our youth
 
06:52:13.548 --> 06:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
and be honest with them the worst thing
 
06:52:15.410 --> 06:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
you can tell a young person is a lie
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
they're not going to believe you as an
 
06:52:18.530 --> 06:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
adult as a parent I'm learning that I
 
06:52:20.390 --> 06:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
have a teenager myself and if I say you
 
06:52:21.590 --> 06:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
should never do this it's the devil's
 
06:52:23.030 --> 06:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
lettuce it'll cause you to lose your
 
06:52:25.250 --> 06:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
sanity and kill people they know I'm
 
06:52:26.750 --> 06:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
lying they know you're lying when you
 
06:52:28.788 --> 06:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
say that let's have a real conversation
 
06:52:31.250 --> 06:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
if it's not illegal and adults can use
 
06:52:33.830 --> 06:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
it responsibly and safely not all will
 
06:52:36.590 --> 06:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
but many will it's happened with alcohol
 
06:52:38.208 --> 06:52:38.218 align:start position:0%
then we can have a real conversation
 
06:52:39.890 --> 06:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
with our children my kids have an easier
 
06:52:41.510 --> 06:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
time getting alcohol than they do I'm
 
06:52:42.948 --> 06:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
getting cannabis than they do getting
 
06:52:45.590 --> 06:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol and last thing on the uh when I
 
06:52:46.730 --> 06:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
was on the Cannabis of the study
 
06:52:48.948 --> 06:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
commission we had a coalition of Youth
 
06:52:50.390 --> 06:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
come in and they said oh it's everywhere
 
06:52:52.430 --> 06:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
kids can't not if they can't avoid it's
 
06:52:54.110 --> 06:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
in the bathrooms they can't get away
 
06:52:55.730 --> 06:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
from it it's everywhere it's so easy to
 
06:52:55.740 --> 06:52:56.390 align:start position:0%
from it it's everywhere it's so easy to
get

06:52:56.390 --> 06:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:52:58.910 --> 06:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
so Don't Legalize It because it'll be
 
06:53:00.830 --> 06:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
easier to get or something like that it
 
06:53:02.390 --> 06:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
was ridiculous I couldn't believe that
 
06:53:04.128 --> 06:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
we can't make something more easy to get
 
06:53:06.288 --> 06:53:06.298 align:start position:0%
than it's so easy to get it's everywhere
 
06:53:08.570 --> 06:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
so all we're doing is regulating making
 
06:53:11.090 --> 06:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
it safer and protecting kids by not
 
06:53:12.650 --> 06:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
being able to sell it to them I've never
 
06:53:14.810 --> 06:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
bought drugs from harder drugs from
 
06:53:18.048 --> 06:53:18.058 align:start position:0%
someone in a bar or a liquor store you
 
06:53:20.030 --> 06:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
know you get you know something if
 
06:53:21.650 --> 06:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
you're buying cannabis on the street as
 
06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
a teenager or a young adult you're more
 
06:53:24.590 --> 06:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
likely to have that same person to sell
 
06:53:26.570 --> 06:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
you fentanyl or heroin that's not going
 
06:53:27.948 --> 06:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
to happen in a regulated market whatever
 
06:53:30.590 --> 06:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
the form is so please support this and
 
06:53:32.390 --> 06:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions or
 
06:53:34.190 --> 06:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
you can go home
 
06:53:37.070 --> 06:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
that wasn't you can ask me questions
 
06:53:40.850 --> 06:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
okay thanks Joe good seeing you too
 
06:53:42.830 --> 06:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to close the hearing
 
06:53:47.628 --> 06:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
on 6 39 and open up the hearing on 5 44
 
06:53:49.448 --> 06:53:49.458 align:start position:0%
and hear from the prime sponsor
 
06:53:52.910 --> 06:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton
 
06:53:55.070 --> 06:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and unlike many
 
06:53:56.810 --> 06:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
I'll try to hold of the three limits a
 
06:53:59.510 --> 06:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
three minute limit I had the fortune to
 
06:54:01.850 --> 06:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
have lunch with former speaker Jasper
 
06:54:04.250 --> 06:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and we were reminiscing
 
06:54:07.850 --> 06:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
how long this has been an issue in 1982
 
06:54:09.830 --> 06:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
I was a ranking Dem on the Judiciary
 
06:54:13.128 --> 06:54:13.138 align:start position:0%
Committee uh former speaker Jasper's on
 
06:54:16.190 --> 06:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and former speaker scitec was
 
06:54:18.948 --> 06:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
the chair of Judge Drake and during that
 
06:54:23.330 --> 06:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
term we passed decriminalization of
 
06:54:25.250 --> 06:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
possession of less than an ounce of pot
 
06:54:28.190 --> 06:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar through this
 
06:54:28.200 --> 06:54:29.330 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar through this
house

06:54:29.330 --> 06:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:54:30.830 --> 06:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
didn't survive the other side of the
 
06:54:32.390 --> 06:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
wall but that's how long we've been
 
06:54:35.990 --> 06:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
going with this the bill before you is
 
06:54:38.750 --> 06:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh I take no Pride about the ship it's a
 
06:54:41.270 --> 06:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
theft it is the bill that passed last
 
06:54:45.530 --> 06:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
session with the addition of uh Edibles
 
06:54:48.590 --> 06:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
added in because the Senate was the
 
06:54:50.750 --> 06:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
stress that didn't have Edibles that's
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
the only difference between the prior
 
06:54:55.010 --> 06:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
Bill and this one I would suggest that
 
06:54:56.750 --> 06:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
you don't pass either
 
06:54:59.330 --> 06:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
the prior bill you heard or this one and
 
06:55:01.368 --> 06:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
I would strongly suggest that the
 
06:55:03.430 --> 06:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee build a hybrid
 
06:55:07.430 --> 06:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
I find objection to the prior bill in
 
06:55:10.250 --> 06:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
trying to build a constituency out of
 
06:55:11.930 --> 06:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
fund distribution
 
06:55:14.628 --> 06:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
and you know as well as I do this bill
 
06:55:15.890 --> 06:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
is probably going to go to Ways and
 
06:55:17.930 --> 06:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
Means once you get done with it
 
06:55:19.310 --> 06:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to decide what the real
 
06:55:22.070 --> 06:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
fund distribution is and if you've been
 
06:55:24.110 --> 06:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
on finance you know that it doesn't
 
06:55:25.968 --> 06:55:25.978 align:start position:0%
matter what fund distribution is because
 
06:55:28.190 --> 06:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
when the money gets tight you stick in
 
06:55:30.170 --> 06:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
the word notwithstanding and all the
 
06:55:31.610 --> 06:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
work you did on trying to decide
 
06:55:33.530 --> 06:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
percentages and fund distribution
 
06:55:33.540 --> 06:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
percentages and fund distribution
disappear

06:55:35.030 --> 06:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
disappear
 
06:55:37.368 --> 06:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
and it becomes non-existent if you're
 
06:55:40.010 --> 06:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
going to deal with funding I would
 
06:55:42.110 --> 06:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
suggest you get 50 for the cities and
 
06:55:44.990 --> 06:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
towns 50 percent of the general fund and
 
06:55:46.850 --> 06:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
when they figure out what kind of money
 
06:55:48.890 --> 06:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
it's bringing in if they want to do a
 
06:55:50.590 --> 06:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
special allocation let them do it them
 
06:55:52.788 --> 06:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh but to do it now just makes
 
06:55:55.010 --> 06:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely no sense I would hope you'd
 
06:55:56.510 --> 06:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
retain the idea of no more than two
 
06:55:58.788 --> 06:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
licenses for any individual or
 
06:56:01.430 --> 06:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
Corporation so that you don't have a
 
06:56:05.270 --> 06:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
bill that enables a cartel to be created
 
06:56:05.280 --> 06:56:08.570 align:start position:0%
bill that enables a cartel to be created
um

06:56:08.570 --> 06:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:11.030 --> 06:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
the arguments you've heard today in
 
06:56:14.150 --> 06:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to either build
 
06:56:17.330 --> 06:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
are virtually identical
 
06:56:20.628 --> 06:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
to what was heard to
 
06:56:23.510 --> 06:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
avoid coming out of prohibition it had
 
06:56:26.750 --> 06:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
no value then it has no value that now
 
06:56:29.930 --> 06:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
and the only thing prohibition does is
 
06:56:31.910 --> 06:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
what it did
 
06:56:34.850 --> 06:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
many years ago creates millionaires back
 
06:56:38.330 --> 06:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
then billionaires today out of monsters
 
06:56:41.090 --> 06:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
it serves no legitimate purpose we are
 
06:56:41.100 --> 06:56:42.230 align:start position:0%
it serves no legitimate purpose we are
surrounded

06:56:42.230 --> 06:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
surrounded
 
06:56:44.270 --> 06:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
and if people say this is going to
 
06:56:45.770 --> 06:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
create a problem they get their heads in
 
06:56:47.510 --> 06:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
the sand if there is a problem that's
 
06:56:49.548 --> 06:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
already here but we're not getting any
 
06:56:52.128 --> 06:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
money out of it to deal with solving the
 
06:56:55.070 --> 06:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
problem I hope you will take both bills
 
06:56:57.650 --> 06:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
create a hybrid and get something that
 
06:57:00.110 --> 06:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
can pass muster across the hall and get
 
06:57:01.910 --> 06:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the governor's desk and I'll be happy
 
06:57:03.948 --> 06:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions I can a little
 
06:57:09.170 --> 06:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:11.750 --> 06:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:57:14.448 --> 06:57:14.458 align:start position:0%

there is no cannabis Advisory board

established which would allow for public

about the risks of cannabis use may not
 
06:59:12.770 --> 06:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to meet the purpose of a
 
06:59:14.448 --> 06:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
comprehensive campaign
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%

06:59:20.030 --> 06:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
critical for New Hampshire to monitor
 
06:59:22.368 --> 06:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
impact over time and be able to respond
 
06:59:24.410 --> 06:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
and to prevention intervention treatment
 
06:59:26.570 --> 06:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
and Recovery needs and there's no direct
 
06:59:28.788 --> 06:59:28.798 align:start position:0%

from anticipated Revenue that is set
 
06:59:32.448 --> 06:59:32.458 align:start position:0%
aside for that prevention treatment and
 
06:59:34.968 --> 06:59:34.978 align:start position:0%
Recovery issues the source of funds in
 
06:59:37.430 --> 06:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is directed directed to these
 
06:59:40.190 --> 06:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
concerns is from any fines imposed
 
06:59:41.868 --> 06:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
those are some of our concerns I'll hand
 
06:59:44.208 --> 06:59:44.218 align:start position:0%
it over to you Mike thanks Jenny
 
06:59:44.218 --> 06:59:44.810 align:start position:0%
it over to you Mike thanks Jenny
um

06:59:44.810 --> 06:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:47.628 --> 06:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
any any bill that legalizes cannabis for
 
06:59:50.990 --> 06:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
adult use in a state that has a very
 
06:59:52.548 --> 06:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
important therapeutic cannabis program
 
06:59:54.350 --> 06:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
needs to thoughtfully consider its
 
06:59:56.030 --> 06:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
impact to the state's therapeutic
 
06:59:58.968 --> 06:59:58.978 align:start position:0%
cannabis program we have about 14
 
07:00:01.910 --> 07:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
000 enrollees in our program
 
07:00:04.430 --> 07:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and like I said any legalization
 
07:00:07.010 --> 07:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
effort needs to consider their needs as
 
07:00:07.020 --> 07:00:08.030 align:start position:0%
effort needs to consider their needs as
well

07:00:08.030 --> 07:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:00:09.708 --> 07:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
um this bill this bill does not
 
07:00:11.810 --> 07:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully consider its impact to the
 
07:00:13.670 --> 07:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
Cannabis program it's important that a
 
07:00:16.610 --> 07:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program be maintained
 
07:00:18.288 --> 07:00:18.298 align:start position:0%
um I know it's late in the day and I'll
 
07:00:19.788 --> 07:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to I'll condense this
 
07:00:21.350 --> 07:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
07:00:24.110 --> 07:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
um the the Crux here is that house bill
 
07:00:26.690 --> 07:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
544 explicitly authorizes The Liquor
 
07:00:30.230 --> 07:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
Commission to compete directly with the
 
07:00:32.868 --> 07:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
atc's license in the state in fact the
 
07:00:35.628 --> 07:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
bill requires state-run dispensaries to
 
07:00:38.330 --> 07:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
sell therapeutic cannabis two
 
07:00:40.448 --> 07:00:40.458 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients
 
07:00:42.590 --> 07:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
and essentially requires them to
 
07:00:43.788 --> 07:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
function as alternative treatment
 
07:00:46.910 --> 07:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
centers without the requirement for them
 
07:00:50.090 --> 07:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
to be a non-not-for-profit entity
 
07:00:53.208 --> 07:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
and that's important page 10 lines 8-13
 
07:00:55.430 --> 07:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
it shall be the duty of the commission
 
07:00:57.590 --> 07:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
to sell cannabis for therapeutic
 
07:01:02.030 --> 07:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
purposes as authorized under RSA 126x
 
07:01:02.040 --> 07:01:02.628 align:start position:0%
purposes as authorized under RSA 126x
um

07:01:02.628 --> 07:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:04.670 --> 07:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
at best it sets up a dual regulatory
 
07:01:06.830 --> 07:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
structure a duplication of effort where
 
07:01:08.330 --> 07:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Health and Human
 
07:01:10.430 --> 07:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
Services and the Liquor Commission are
 
07:01:13.548 --> 07:01:13.558 align:start position:0%
regulating the same uh the same entities
 
07:01:15.530 --> 07:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
um but at the worst it jeopardizes the
 
07:01:18.830 --> 07:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
the viability of the state's atcs
 
07:01:21.230 --> 07:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and the access of 14 000 patients to
 
07:01:23.690 --> 07:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program
 
07:01:25.490 --> 07:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
um there were a number of Provisions in
 
07:01:27.530 --> 07:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
the previous bill that we heard
 
07:01:31.310 --> 07:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
um that require and allow a soft Landing
 
07:01:33.948 --> 07:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
if you will for the therapeutic canvas
 
07:01:37.730 --> 07:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
program including uh collaboration and
 
07:01:40.310 --> 07:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Department uh in
 
07:01:43.070 --> 07:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
in making these large changes
 
07:01:46.250 --> 07:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
um day one on this bill uh the the state
 
07:01:47.750 --> 07:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
liquor stores will be able to sell
 
07:01:49.610 --> 07:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis the therapeutic
 
07:01:51.288 --> 07:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients
 
07:01:53.990 --> 07:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
um without the same regulatory structure
 
07:01:58.270 --> 07:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
in place as for uh for um for the atcs
 
07:02:02.208 --> 07:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
so again we are available and willing to
 
07:02:04.850 --> 07:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
work on any legislation
 
07:02:07.490 --> 07:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
um that this committee wants to uh put
 
07:02:09.410 --> 07:02:09.420 align:start position:0%

problems in our state at e Futures we
 
07:03:11.030 --> 07:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
believe that it is imperative to get

cannabis commercialization policy right
 
07:03:16.070 --> 07:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
from the start optimal policy for our
 
07:03:17.810 --> 07:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
state must utilize best available
 
07:03:20.090 --> 07:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence to reduce public

state we've created principles for
 
07:03:31.670 --> 07:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis policy and regulations and we
 
07:03:34.670 --> 07:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
track each bill based on how it aligns
 
07:03:36.830 --> 07:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
with these principles these include
 
07:03:39.230 --> 07:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
protecting Children and Youth promoting
 
07:03:41.030 --> 07:03:41.040 align:start position:0%

to efforts to reduce Harms
 
07:03:54.890 --> 07:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh based on these bills uh new features
 
07:03:59.628 --> 07:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh opposes both hb639 with and 545
 
07:04:02.270 --> 07:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
because they both were 544 excuse me
 
07:04:03.830 --> 07:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
because they failed to include our
 
07:04:05.868 --> 07:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
organization's principles
 
07:04:08.330 --> 07:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
um what I have for you today is a copy
 
07:04:11.150 --> 07:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
of our principles along with how each
 
07:04:12.948 --> 07:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
bill which is very different
 
07:04:15.530 --> 07:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
um aligns up with our principles I'll
 
07:04:18.530 --> 07:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
provide that to you and our testimony as
 
07:04:21.110 --> 07:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
well and a study um from the American
 
07:04:23.208 --> 07:04:23.218 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics Association are at the
 
07:04:25.788 --> 07:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
increase in cannabis exposures which
 
07:04:27.830 --> 07:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
backs up uh the reason for a lot of the
 
07:04:31.010 --> 07:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
policies and principles we have uh today
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:38.330 --> 07:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
great thank you any questions from the
 
07:04:39.948 --> 07:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
07:04:43.070 --> 07:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
Cena thank you very much
 
07:04:50.208 --> 07:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:52.010 --> 07:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll be very brief
 
07:04:53.810 --> 07:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
this time for the record Matt Simon
 
07:04:55.910 --> 07:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
representing Prime ATC
 
07:04:57.830 --> 07:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
on the previous bill I asked four
 
07:05:00.230 --> 07:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions and the answer was yes to all
 
07:05:02.448 --> 07:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
four of them on this bill the answer is
 
07:05:05.628 --> 07:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
not yes to all four of them does the
 
07:05:06.948 --> 07:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
bill take a thoughtful approach to the
 
07:05:09.948 --> 07:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program no you've
 
07:05:11.448 --> 07:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
already heard from Mr hold on that so I
 
07:05:13.490 --> 07:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
won't repeat his comments
 
07:05:15.530 --> 07:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
would the legislation create a broad
 
07:05:17.628 --> 07:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
distribution of economic opportunities
 
07:05:20.390 --> 07:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
again no
 
07:05:22.430 --> 07:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
the economic opportunities would be
 
07:05:24.468 --> 07:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
realized by the state
 
07:05:26.810 --> 07:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
does the bill repair damage caused by
 
07:05:28.610 --> 07:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
the war on cannabis such as including
 
07:05:30.350 --> 07:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions to annul past criminal
 
07:05:33.410 --> 07:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
records no it does not it would simply
 
07:05:34.788 --> 07:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
set up the state to start making money
 
07:05:36.288 --> 07:05:36.298 align:start position:0%
off the sale of cannabis without
 
07:05:36.298 --> 07:05:37.548 align:start position:0%
off the sale of cannabis without
redressing

07:05:37.548 --> 07:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
redressing
 
07:05:39.830 --> 07:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
past Harms
 
07:05:41.448 --> 07:05:41.458 align:start position:0%
Ford is the bill create accessible
 
07:05:43.070 --> 07:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
transparent regulatory process to
 
07:05:44.628 --> 07:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
protect consumers and minimize any
 
07:05:46.610 --> 07:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
potential negative impacts again I'm
 
07:05:48.830 --> 07:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to know for reasons that Mr Holt
 
07:05:50.390 --> 07:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the Scribe already said and I will
 
07:05:53.030 --> 07:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony uh glad to hear
 
07:05:55.430 --> 07:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we're not seriously talking about
 
07:05:57.708 --> 07:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
passing that same bill again
 
07:06:00.230 --> 07:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:06:02.390 --> 07:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:06:08.270 --> 07:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:10.910 --> 07:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
how you all doing tonight
 
07:06:13.610 --> 07:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
I support both these bills
 
07:06:16.610 --> 07:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
um I know I speak it on 544 but I I
 
07:06:19.010 --> 07:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
support the last bill as well
 
07:06:21.590 --> 07:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
um but I have a couple questions
 
07:06:23.030 --> 07:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what the police are
 
07:06:25.310 --> 07:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
going to are going to do when everyone
 
07:06:27.110 --> 07:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
has weed right they're gonna have
 
07:06:28.368 --> 07:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
nothing to do because they just arrest
 
07:06:31.070 --> 07:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
everyone and throw them in jail and I'm
 
07:06:32.570 --> 07:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
just wondering how are their kids going
 
07:06:34.128 --> 07:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
to eat at night if you get that bill
 
07:06:36.170 --> 07:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
passed now they just got nothing to do
 
07:06:38.810 --> 07:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
and a bunch of people gonna be out free
 
07:06:41.330 --> 07:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
smoking weed on the streets you know uh
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
I got a whiff of weed the other day
 
07:06:45.170 --> 07:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
driving by this house and next thing you
 
07:06:47.390 --> 07:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm stuffing down a Big Mac
 
07:06:49.010 --> 07:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay me back for that Big
 
07:06:51.830 --> 07:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
Mac no I really want to know like you
 
07:06:53.090 --> 07:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
know we got to take care of these people
 
07:06:54.948 --> 07:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
we we can't just let them smoke weed
 
07:06:56.930 --> 07:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
peacefully in their homes I prefer they
 
07:06:59.208 --> 07:06:59.218 align:start position:0%
go out drinking with the legal uh
 
07:07:01.968 --> 07:07:01.978 align:start position:0%
alcohol that the state sells and uh you
 
07:07:03.410 --> 07:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
know maybe we'll get into a fight or two
 
07:07:06.530 --> 07:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
and that's way better the solution than
 
07:07:08.750 --> 07:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis and allowing us to
 
07:07:10.968 --> 07:07:10.978 align:start position:0%
you know smoke weed in our home maybe
 
07:07:12.770 --> 07:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
get a little hungry and maybe eat too
 
07:07:14.628 --> 07:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
much that's horrible obesity is like one
 
07:07:16.610 --> 07:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
of the biggest problems in America not
 
07:07:18.770 --> 07:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
you know drinking and driving and buying
 
07:07:21.230 --> 07:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol from the state that is okay I'm
 
07:07:22.968 --> 07:07:22.978 align:start position:0%
okay with that we should allow that and
 
07:07:24.230 --> 07:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know the police have something to do
 
07:07:26.208 --> 07:07:26.218 align:start position:0%
as long as people are drinking right put
 
07:07:29.150 --> 07:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
smoking weed at home that is not okay
 
07:07:31.610 --> 07:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh God forbid with you know sales go up
 
07:07:33.708 --> 07:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
and you guys generate enough Revenue to
 
07:07:35.690 --> 07:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh you know support the police at that
 
07:07:37.190 --> 07:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
point but you got to think about the
 
07:07:39.530 --> 07:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
police kids because next thing you know
 
07:07:41.510 --> 07:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
the kids are going to be uh smoking a
 
07:07:42.468 --> 07:07:42.478 align:start position:0%
little bit of weed and getting hungry
 
07:07:43.730 --> 07:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
but the police don't have any money to
 
07:07:45.770 --> 07:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
pay for their kids food so
 
07:07:48.110 --> 07:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
we should think about this and um
 
07:07:49.910 --> 07:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry I'm just a little
 
07:07:53.208 --> 07:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
paranoid here don't ask why but
 
07:07:54.948 --> 07:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
um I came here and I was still able to
 
07:07:56.930 --> 07:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
speak and you know hopefully you guys
 
07:07:58.850 --> 07:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
you know hear me out and you know a
 
07:08:00.830 --> 07:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of weed can go a long way and
 
07:08:03.468 --> 07:08:03.478 align:start position:0%
don't knock it until you try it right so
 
07:08:04.968 --> 07:08:04.978 align:start position:0%
maybe you smoke a little bit and find
 
07:08:06.468 --> 07:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
out what it's about then you can decide
 
07:08:08.510 --> 07:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
if it should be illegal or not just like
 
07:08:09.530 --> 07:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
you do when you're going home tonight
 
07:08:12.650 --> 07:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
and you have a you know a nice Scotch
 
07:08:22.310 --> 07:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:24.650 --> 07:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:08:28.850 --> 07:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh chair we're calling Nathaniel Goran
 
07:08:31.250 --> 07:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
07:08:33.530 --> 07:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
common man's part no maybe not it's just
 
07:08:35.170 --> 07:08:35.180 align:start position:0%
a different party now
 
07:08:37.968 --> 07:08:37.978 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask you is does marijuana
 
07:08:38.750 --> 07:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be good for your eyes
 
07:08:40.430 --> 07:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
because this is the smallest political
 
07:08:43.250 --> 07:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
card handwriting I've print I've ever
 
07:08:45.948 --> 07:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
seen I I said maybe this is only for
 
07:08:47.510 --> 07:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
young people that like old people can't
 
07:08:49.610 --> 07:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
read this or you know well you know I
 
07:08:51.530 --> 07:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
actually they misprinted a smaller

these bills that I these are all early
 
07:10:29.990 --> 07:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
bills so I I'm you know was feeling
 
07:10:31.968 --> 07:10:31.978 align:start position:0%
under pressure to get get them out and
 
07:10:33.890 --> 07:10:33.900 align:start position:0%

um so otherwise we'll we'll be working
 
07:10:46.250 --> 07:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
on those bills uh on the next Monday uh
 
07:10:48.890 --> 07:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
Friday anything that we're actually able
 
07:10:52.610 --> 07:10:52.620 align:start position:0%

07:10:55.510 --> 07:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning
 
07:10:58.548 --> 07:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
the speakers just asked that we would
 
07:11:02.510 --> 07:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
have a session Thursday February 2nd
 
07:11:05.570 --> 07:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
after our uh session evidently they
 
07:11:07.968 --> 07:11:07.978 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot on the calendar so we
 
07:11:10.788 --> 07:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
will have a committee exec session
 
07:11:13.010 --> 07:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
Thursday afternoon
 
07:11:14.868 --> 07:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
and but that'll be based upon whatever
 
07:11:20.930 --> 07:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:22.788 --> 07:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
it'll be in the calendar everything will
 
07:11:23.810 --> 07:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
be in the calendar but I just thought
 
07:11:27.650 --> 07:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
you should all know so be there for this
 
07:11:27.660 --> 07:11:28.788 align:start position:0%
you should all know so be there for this

second
 
07:11:31.010 --> 07:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay so and this is really important to
 
07:11:32.868 --> 07:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
