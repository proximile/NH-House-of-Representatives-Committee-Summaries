today they both deal with delegates to a
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
convention Convention of the states or

uh 392 the description refers to a
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention so I'm going
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
to uh throw it to you both and go ahead
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
and explain to us uh the Amendments and
 
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
what we need to know before we take up
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
those two HBS
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
honorable members uh for the record my
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
name is Ellen Reed I represent
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 new market and new fields
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll start with with the
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
overview to refresh everybody's uh
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
memory and I have my legal counsel Hill
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
here to correct me Wherever I May air so
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh 269 and 392 were two separate bills
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with how we handle delegates to
 
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
conventions 269 which for disclosure I
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
was not a co-sponsor of not because I
 
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
opposed it just I didn't happen to be a
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of deals with conventions
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
interstate and Interstate conventions
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
very broadly does not call for election
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
of delegates it covered uh what we call
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
Article 5 conventions sometimes we
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
casually refer to them as constitutional
 
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
conventions there's a little Nuance
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
there but
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
um it covered that but because it was
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with all these conventions it
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
kind of dealt on what I would call a
 
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.539 align:start position:0%
more shallow level and when we're
 
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
talking about about regular Interstate
 
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:12.500 align:start position:0%
policy making conventions
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
other other kinds of conventions like
 
00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
that you may not need like a lot of
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
depth but if you're dealing with the
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution and changing the
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the country we wanted to
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have really strict
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
rules on how we select delegates how we
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
pull delegates how we nullify their
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
votes which is where 392 comes in so
 
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.470 align:start position:0%
votes which is where 392 comes in so
while

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
269 is Broad and shallow 392 is very
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
narrow specific to Article 5 conventions
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
but gets far deeper and far more
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
controls over those delegates so 269 I
 
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
think there was broad support for this
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
was the one that I was running around
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
last week getting the amendment together
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
for you all so at the request of the
 
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
chair I put the amendment in and that's
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment you see before you the the
 
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.330 align:start position:0%
the amendment you see before you the the
amendment

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
does two things the first is it exempts
 
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
the uniform law commission we understood
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the executive branch would
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
have found including the uniform law
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
commission objectionable and so we
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
Exempted that the other thing that it
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
does is the very last line the
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter shall not
 
00:24:32.049 --> 00:24:32.059 align:start position:0%
supersede any provisions of RSA 667
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
667 is the RSA that is impacted by the
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
other Bill
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
392 which is why the chair had me go and
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
have this amendment drafted to make sure
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
that these two bills could pass without
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
interfering with each other so that
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
final line in this amendment on 269 is
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
what does that so this would if passed
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
as amended 269
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
restrict delegates to all these
 
00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
restrict delegates to all these
conventions

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
conventions
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
um with the the measures that are in
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is not specifically that's for
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
appointing delegates but we want to make
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
sure that for constitutional conventions
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
or Article 5 conventions that we are
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
electing delegates and that we have
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
really good control over those delegates
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
so that's the amendment on this that
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
exemption on 667 that's where we go over
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
to 392 392 is the one that's specific
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
but deep
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that impacts as you can see 667 and
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
all of the election language in HB 392
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
is in RSA 667.
 
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
the only changes in the amendment on 392
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
were the ones that were brought up
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
during hearing the first change at the
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
top changes from one delegate per
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
congressional district plus one
 
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:54.740 align:start position:0%
Statewide to two delegates per
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
congressional district plus one
 
00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.890 align:start position:0%
congressional district plus one
Statewide

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
did I sorry I thought I heard you okay
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
and then the second part there's two
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
paragraphs at the bottom the original
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
Bill had an unspecified penalty for any
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
delegate who violated their oath an
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
unspecified excuse me is unspecified
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
felony penalty the committee sounded
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
during the hearing that that may be
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
considered too strict so we have
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
separated out knowingly and purposefully
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
which is very common in criminal law so
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
that if they knowingly which is the
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
lower culpable State
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
um violate their oath they are guilty of
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor a
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
and if they purposefully which is that
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
very high prosecution has to prove
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
intent For Thought planning
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
um that that is a felony B which is the
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
lower of the two felonies I think that
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
maxes out at five years
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
so uh I have done what the committee has
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
asked in preparing these amendments I'll
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
just turn it over to my my legal counsel
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I just want to clarify uh one
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
thing the um 269 does include the the
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
provision that is widely considered the
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
gold standard and single strongest
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
protection over any uh delegate uh to
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
whom there is a limiting instruction
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
which is that the their vote would be
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
invalidated and replaced this language
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
has been used in both the Article 5
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
ratification conventions in 1933 as well
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
as the Electoral College uh in which
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
context it was upheld unanimously by the
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court both versions include that
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
uh the uh it's all of the other aspects
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
of regulating the Article 5 proposing
 
00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:40.460 align:start position:0%
convention uh that are included in in
 
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:43.460 align:start position:0%
392 that are not in 269 which includes
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
elections both for the uh the delegates
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
as well as their alternates and some
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
more details on how that mechanism Works
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
to ensure uh that the invalidation
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
process runs smoothly and uh seamlessly
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
and I would just end with
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
um both of these are neutral on the
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
concept of calling for an article five
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
but we know that we may very well be
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
pulled into an article 5 convention
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
without us having ever passed any call
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
ourselves although that did just pass
 
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
this committee so
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I think we're about six or eight
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
states away from the balanced budget
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
amendment call passing depends on on how
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
we count but the point is is that both
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
of these simply put the procedure in
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
place so that we're not left in the
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
Mr fieldman you were at the big session
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
we had at Repsol you've been here before
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
and thank you for all the uh time you
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
put in to try to explain to us so we
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
understand better
 
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
this process related to Article Five
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
conventions now this spot this committee
 
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:55.940 align:start position:0%
has already voted 13 to 5 to move hc-1
 
00:28:59.769 --> 00:28:59.779 align:start position:0%
hcr1 on so both of these
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
HBS the only two HBS we have today house
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
bills uh both concerned
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
um the delegate issues and we'll take
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
them up separately uh
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
um in a short time I want to welcome the
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
subs we have today uh representative
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%

being here
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
um represent Lundgren is supposedly
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
inbound and I have not heard from
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Katya chorus uh
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your service and
 
00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
oh representative Thomas I welcome I'm
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
glad very glad you're here especially
 
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:49.580 align:start position:0%
glad you're here okay uh thank you both
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
and you're welcome I know uh Mr Spielman
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
you've got a zoom or something
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
representative welcome to stay around if
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
if you are here uh I may uh because I
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
can uh ask you to comment or explain
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
something once we get to both of those
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
hb's if you're still here and if there
 
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
are questions while you're there does
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions for
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative Reed uh yes uh
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative Platt just uh ask whether
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
it makes a difference which one is taken
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
up first it does not
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
um neither of these bills as amended
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
would conflict with each other so indeed
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't matter which one we passed
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
on the floor but it doesn't matter which
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
one passes in committee first at any
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
rate what matters is what the floor in
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate do which one final which one
 
00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:38.299 align:start position:0%
gets signed by the governor first
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
typically that means the second bill
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
that gets signed takes precedent as I
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
understand the procedure we have a
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian here but it doesn't
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
matter which one the committee passes
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
first as I understand it having said
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
that they do not Conflict at all
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you again so let's get to
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
this at the top of the lineup there used
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
to be more questions Mr chairman no
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
very quickly I just want to insert if
 
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
anyone does not I tried to make sure
 
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
everybody had copies of the Amendments
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
if you don't I can make sure you have
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
them and also I will be staying for the
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
duration of the executive session and I
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
am at the committee's service go ahead
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you rat breed I just want to
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
clarify for because
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
um I and I really found what the your
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
conclusion very helpful that but I've
 
00:31:29.649 --> 00:31:29.659 align:start position:0%
heard some people say that they oppose
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
retinal's bill because they oppose an
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention so I just want to
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
make it crystal clear that in your
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
opinion rep read this isn't about
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
whether or not we have an article 5
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
convention but do you believe this just
 
00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:48.299 align:start position:0%
makes it more democratic if we do that
 
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
is precisely the case so as I said
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
neither of these bills either as
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
introduced or as amended take a position
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
on calling for an article five I think
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
there is some and I would I might
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
categorize it as a bad faith argument in
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
that if we pass something that makes it
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
less scary then we might more easily get
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
to an article 5 convention but the point
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
is we may get pulled into that whether
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
or not New Hampshire wants to and we
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
have to have control troll over our
 
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
delegates 392 allows for the election
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
unlike 269 the election the direct
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
election of delegates their alternate
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
alternates and has very strict controls
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
over if they violate their oath and go
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
off topic so you are right is far more
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
small D Democratic in that sense uh also
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
I provided uh last week when I testified
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
on this bill a letter from uh then
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
Senator Joe Biden president of course
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
also calling for the passage of this
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
type of Regulation at that time it was
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh Congressional regulation but it's the
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
same type of added protection even
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
though he did not support having an
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention he did support the
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
idea of having the regulations in place
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
in case one occurs I may be a little bit
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
out of my legal depth but I understand
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
there's been many attempts at a
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
congressional control over the delegates
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
in Article 5 convention and the my
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
understanding is that Congress this
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
really doesn't play a part in that that
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
it's strictly the states that can
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
control their delegates
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
maybe states can control only states can
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
control their delegates Congress plays a
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
role in calling the convention itself
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again to the two of you any uh
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
representative gagne
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
probably a question to the chair uh
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
does everyone on this committee right
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
now have the amendment for 392 and two
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
is there one for 269
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
yes or amendments for both of those
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
measures uh that have been emailed to
 
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
everyone in the committee and uh
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
representative just passed out a higher
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
copy right I did but I don't think it
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
made it to that specific Corner because
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
you started before I could finish
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
passing it out and I didn't want to
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
approach that's why I need a hard copy I
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
will I will do that as soon as I'm done
 
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.009 align:start position:0%
will I will do that as soon as I'm done
here

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
or I can do that right now uh sure if if
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
you could get that to us any other
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr fieldman or
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
okay uh I want to get right to this uh
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%

so go ahead and speak to your amen
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
amending motion so as it was uh defined
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
so the the amendment here clarified the
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
election process here for the
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
representatives of the districts or the
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh the representative districts with the
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
how the delegates will be elected and
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
the second component here is that it's
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh redefining there was some concern
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
from this committee about the severity
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
of the punishments uh that they were
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
scaled back a bit uh depending on
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
whether it's knowingly or willing or um
 
00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
yeah intentionally purposefully uh went
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
against their uh intended uh role at the
 
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:33.290 align:start position:0%
against their uh intended uh role at the
delegation

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh would anyone
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
else like to speak to this amendment
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I know the
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
member introduces in all good faith uh
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
but I am going to vote against it and
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
the reason being is the penalty of being
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
a Class B uh felony and a class B felony
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman under New Hampshire law is
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
three and a half to seven years in the
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
state prison and it's a fine line
 
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
between purposefully and knowingly
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
committing an act and I would hate to
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
see anybody fulfilling this Civic
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
obligation by serving on a convention
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
being charged with that serious and
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
offense for something they probably may
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
not have realized they were doing so
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the amendment
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for that
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative this did come up when we
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
visited this the first time I think
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative gagne it might have been
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
him uh spoke about concerns about the
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor versus the felony it was
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
Finney was very concerned about the
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
severity right okay representative
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
Infinity so it's something we have
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
talked about before I mean I understand
 
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
that is a concern for some other
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
anything else other comments on the
 
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.870 align:start position:0%
anything else other comments on the
motion

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
um I will just make one and then I'll
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the roll
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to support the amending
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
motion and the
 
00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:57.740 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that uh the co-sponsor
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
already touched on
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
this committee has already passed and
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
has sent eights see our uh see I went to
 
00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:11.339 align:start position:0%
the house floor
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
and I think what representative Reed uh
 
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
said is very important whether you like
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
a uh the concept of an article 5
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
convention or not uh if it someday is
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
thrust upon us if it happens Could
 
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
Happen people certainly want to some
 
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:29.660 align:start position:0%
people want to make it happen
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
my position
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
Echoes representative reads in that we
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
want to have the best definition that we
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
can have for our delegates in the
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
delegate process and the delegate issues
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
and and this does that so whether you
 
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:46.700 align:start position:0%
love the concept of a convention or not
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh I think that the amendment in the
 
00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:51.970 align:start position:0%
uh I think that the amendment in the
Bill

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:51.980 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
provides some safeguards for us down the
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
road if this ever happens that's where I
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
oh I just think it was made very clear
 
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:05.339 align:start position:0%
that it's purposefully like a very high
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
bar because it's our most essential
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.310 align:start position:0%
bar because it's our most essential
document

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
I think representative uh anything else
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
if not I'm going to ask Madam clerk to
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%

00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
an otpa motion on HP 392 it does have an
 
00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:40.010 align:start position:0%
an otpa motion on HP 392 it does have an
FN

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
FN
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
so that uh prop probably would uh
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
preclude it going on consent if I
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
understand the the rules correctly
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
so this would not be eligible for
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
consent because of the FN piece of this
 
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.609 align:start position:0%
consent because of the FN piece of this
uh

00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
so back to representative man your
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%

is there
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
emotion like I make make a motion ideal
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay represent represent Manion again
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
stepping up and his motion is to itl is
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
there a second for that second is from
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative shortliff thank you uh
 
00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:32.099 align:start position:0%
representative shurliff uh represent
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
meaning would you care to speak to your
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
motion of itl yeah
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so during the testimony there was a
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
lot of heated discussion on on both
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
sides and I I don't believe that this
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
resolution is the way to go about this
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
recognition process I feel like we're
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
getting in the middle of like a family
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
squabble uh and making any kind of
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
decision from the state level is not the
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
right way to go about it perhaps uh we
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
can introduce a bill sometime to have
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
the the Council of uh First Nations that
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
we have uh discuss this and find a
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do so but I don't think
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
shirtle if we're here to speak to your
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
second I would just concur with
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Manion with his comments
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
and I know the sponsors had the best of
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
intentions I was concerned about the
 
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
mechanism being hcf being a house
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution and not involved
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the executive branch and I couldn't
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
say any better than representative Mania
 
00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:25.619 align:start position:0%

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative O'Neill want to speak
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
briefly and say I think I think I speak
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
for many of us when I say that we
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
recognize how important it is to
 
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
recognize these populations
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think several of us may
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
feel that this isn't the right way to go
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
about it but we understand the
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%

I'll simply add that those of us and I
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
know the folks in the room if you looked
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
at the portal and also the emails that
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
we got that were they were very much
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
split there was some very strong uh
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
messages on both sides and uh that was a
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
concern for me was that there was such a
 
00:52:11.579 --> 00:52:12.849 align:start position:0%
concern for me was that there was such a
split

00:52:12.849 --> 00:52:12.859 align:start position:0%
split

while I know that there are problems
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
with Social Security and Medicare
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
because if the money's involved and it
 
00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:35.180 align:start position:0%
probably needs some tweaking but to um
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
diametrically opposed to getting rid
 
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.490 align:start position:0%
diametrically opposed to getting rid
of

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%

especially with cuts and benefits I'm
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
myself I am on a uh I I'm old enough to
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
have Social Security and Medicaid and uh
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
to cut those benefits would for many
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
people would uh older Americans would
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
not be to their benefit and
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
two hours either so I will be voting to

Manchester and echoed the same cut well
 
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
I don't feel the problems with Social
 
00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
Security uh I do think that this is a
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
noble uh motion and that we should
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
and without objection we can put we'll
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
put that on consent if there is no
 
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.750 align:start position:0%
put that on consent if there is no
objection

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you all
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman yes
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
um as you know I've got to be over the
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
speaker's office at 11. I wonder if we
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
could take the uh the retain Bill up now
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
before I leave sure if that'd be
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
convenient for the chair sure we have
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
three measures to go uh HR 15 HR 16 in
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
the uh measure that we're we want to uh
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
bring back
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that would be hcr4
 
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
we took this up earlier and we voted to
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
retain but we held on to that we did not
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
submit the uh the retain motion which
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
enables us to uh revisit it but we need
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
a motion to reconsider I motion
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
reconsider thank you represent meaning
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
for jumping right in there again I will
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
second it and thank you for jumping in
 
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
again keeping this moving so we have a
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
a motion to reconsider hcr4 and we need
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
to uh do you want to speak to your
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
motion absolutely so I I'm I support uh
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
term limits I would very much like to
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
see this uh be reconsidered uh by the
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
committee we should make a vote on it I
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
saw the vote get a throw we just passed
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns people had about a
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
Convention of States uh delegates
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
running amongst we just we got those
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
through so I figured we should do this
 
00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.109 align:start position:0%
through so I figured we should do this
now

00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%

all right as I said uh we have uh we
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
have an amendment as well uh standby on
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:26.900 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
agreed to reconsider the
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
measure now before we can entertain a
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
which I was starting to look for which I
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
was a little bit premature before we can
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
ask for that
 
01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.450 align:start position:0%
ask for that
um

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:43.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
motion for OTP or ATL or whatever we
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
have to address the fact that now that
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
the measures back in play the motion the
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
previous motion was retained we need to
 
01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:58.010 align:start position:0%
previous motion was retained we need to
uh

01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
un retain it so to speak
 
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.450 align:start position:0%
un retain it so to speak
um

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
and we're fortunate the house clerk is
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
here to make sure that we have this
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
protocol correctly and no unretained is
 
01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:11.579 align:start position:0%
not a formal motion but
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
the proper Motion in this case would be
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
vote down retain okay it's similar to
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
unretained but we need a motion uh if
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
you would rips a man into a low down
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
retain vote down retain
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes second
 
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
right the motion on this measure that
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to reconsider is now to
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
vote down the previous uh uh
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
recommendation which was to retain
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative Charlotte
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would ask the
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
committee to vote no on the motion uh we
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
did the right thing in retaining this
 
01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:50.329 align:start position:0%
did the right thing in retaining this
bill

01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
under our house rule house rule 45
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
cities one which says that when we
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
retain a bill no action B shall be taken
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
till the second half of the biennium
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
because this bill was still in the
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
possession of the committee and not
 
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
had not gone to the clerk's office
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
it was still in play and could be acted
 
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:10.910 align:start position:0%
it was still in play and could be acted
on

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
under our
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
it's always been traditional to read
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
when we reconsider a retention motion
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
that there must have been some
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
significant change or some piece of
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
information that came forward before
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
that bill went to the clerk's office
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the prime
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
sponsor the only information we have is
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
they want to change the title as
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
Shakespeare said arose By Any Other Name
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
it still arose this is still the same
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
bill that we retained and I would ask
 
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
take care of some short left uh other
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.089 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:20.099 --> 01:04:22.970 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure well these are
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
guarantee it
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is here I may as a
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
courtesy may want him to speak to this
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
I'm also going to ask you for
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes uh the house
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
clerk is here as well so just so we're
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
clear on how what this process is and to
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
uh and I want to speak to representative
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
shirtle's comment
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
um in a few moments uh Mr Mr Clark thank
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman just
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
procedurally you voted yes to
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
reconsideration so you are now back at
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
the last motion that was adopted and
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is the retained motion it's not to
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
undo the retained motion the motion is
 
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
to retain a yes vote means to retain a
 
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
no vote means to not retain and consider
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
another action
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
so a yes is to keep retained a no means
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
to take some subsequent action just to
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
just to clarify uh we we can't undo the
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
motion only vote it down and Mr chairman
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
just to follow yes having our friend uh
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor speak on this we are
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
an executive session uh the question is
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
before us and I think it should be a
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
simple up and down vote by the committee
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
as I said I voted as a courtesy for the
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
member for us to discuss this but I
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
think now uh we should vote on whether
 
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
to retain it or not I'd ask the
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
committee to vote Yes to please retain
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
think represent sir lift we will have
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
that uh vote on the motion and I think
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
it should be clear to everyone if you
 
01:05:59.099 --> 01:06:00.109 align:start position:0%
it should be clear to everyone if you
want

01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
the measure to stay retained now that
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
we've brought it back into play that you
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
will vote yes if you want to not
 
01:06:11.569 --> 01:06:11.579 align:start position:0%
maintain the retain motion you would
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
vote no and that and then if if the no
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
was knows were to Prevail then we could
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
entertain another motion if the yes is
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
Prevail then we will be staying with
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
retention uh representative Platt last I
 
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
know the it was a motion on the floor
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
and seconded to unretain not and so I
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
think that has to be with Ron and and no
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
that's reconsider is already passed that
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
the unretained has to be withdrawn and
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
the new motion rate to retain to follow
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
what the clerk said
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh to be clear and again the house clerk
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
is here uh go ahead Mr Clark
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman uh representative that
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
is not correct we we immediately
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
returned to the previously passed motion
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
so the previously passed motion was to
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
retain so that motion is now what's
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
before you
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
the the motion that was made to
 
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
unretained was not a proper motion it
 
01:07:09.529 --> 01:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
should not be it shouldn't it doesn't
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
need to be considered because it was not
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Clerk so again uh the
 
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:21.020 align:start position:0%
a yes vote is to keep the original
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
retention uh status of this measure a no
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
vote means that you would like to see an
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
Boris is now a yes vote instead of a no

vote

01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
okay so what that means is that the
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
original retention motion is uh no
 
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
longer in effect and we are looking for
 
01:09:51.849 --> 01:09:51.859 align:start position:0%
a new motion for
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
hcr4 motion OTP with the amendment okay
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh is there a second second again uh
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
this is easy for you madam clerk uh
 
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Manion made the motion
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
second was made by representative gagne
 
01:10:09.719 --> 01:10:10.729 align:start position:0%
second was made by representative gagne
um

01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned an amendment
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
so the amendment here uh is uh replacing
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
the title so it says applying for the
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
convention of the states under Article 5
 
01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention before it was
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
uh more or not clear
 
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay and that is amendment zero four
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
seven zero H correct
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh at this time I wonder the same
 
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
thing that I did earlier with
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reed when she was here uh
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
as a courtesy if he wants to the prime
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh I'd like to invite you to
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%

01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative shirtless concern uh
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
which is a uh a fair question in terms
 
01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:52.970 align:start position:0%
which is a uh a fair question in terms
of

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
to take something off or to reconsider
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
something there needs to be some
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
substantive or something you need to
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
explain why there's some substantive new
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
information so that's up to you what
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative uh Wallace do you want to
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%

um as was addressed when I introduced
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
the bill there was a uh there was a
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
couple of minor drafting errors I
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe the bill was brought from 2016
 
01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:29.780 align:start position:0%
when I first filed this and resubmitted
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
so the title was inaccurate
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
the analysis was inaccurate and the
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor District was inaccurate so
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's more than just
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
the name being different the way it was
 
01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.709 align:start position:0%
the name being different the way it was
introduced

01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
um it had me listed as District 33 which
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
is actually representative Simpson
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
so the representative from District 33
 
01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
is clearly not me I would argue that
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson is the Rose not
 
01:11:58.199 --> 01:11:59.810 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson is the Rose not
myself

01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
um so that that
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
and the difference in the title caused
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative Smith who is seed who was
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
a substitute that day to
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
accurately read the bill that we were
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
asking Congress the New Hampshire house
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
would be asking Congress to term limit
 
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
itself which would be a ridiculous ask
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
and I would agree with her on that
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
analysis because the analysis from OLS
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
was inaccurate that's what's been
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
corrected the measure is clearly in
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
convention request and the subject
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
matter of term limits is fully one-third
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
of hcr1 subject matter so the committee
 
01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:45.380 align:start position:0%
voted quite strongly of a 15-4 for hcr1
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the same boat I would expect would be
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
similar on HCR 4 because it's a you know
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's a single subject matter
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
parallel measure and that's that's the
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
extent of the um the amendment
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions for
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor while he's here if
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
he'll take questions if there are any
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative thank you to

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
OTP as amended so in Israel second yes
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay uh motion by representative Manion
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
to move this measure otpa with the
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
amendment just approved seconded by
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative gagne do you want to
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the uh amended motion so the
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
amended measure yeah as I was mentioning
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
before I support term limits I think
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's important a power check against the
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
government I'm I'm all for a Convention
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
of states to get that done because
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
they're sure not going to do it
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
themselves so I think we should uh vote
 
01:16:51.719 --> 01:16:54.890 align:start position:0%
themselves so I think we should uh vote
OTP

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to speak to
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative I oppose it I just I
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
think it's Democratic to let people for
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
example I'm a big Bernie person if I
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
lived in Vermont I would vote for him
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
over and over again because I think he's
 
01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
doing a great job and I think that is
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
the check and balance that people get to
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
vote for who they want to represent them
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks sure thank you Mr
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
chair I um I agree with my colleague
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and this is about as undemocratic as
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
you can imagine if you do not uh accept
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
the wish of the voters by preventing
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
them to have a candidate to run that
 
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
they wish to support we're essentially
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
saying it doesn't matter what the voters
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
think if we don't allow them vote for
 
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
their candidate
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
was to speak to this motion of otpa
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.550 align:start position:0%
 
opinion

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think it was ever meant
 
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
for Congress to have a lifetime job
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
whether you vote keep voting for these
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
people or not so I am in favor of term
 
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.149 align:start position:0%
people or not so I am in favor of term
limits

01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Platt I would just point
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
out that the president of the United
 
01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
States is termed Limited
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
any other comments or discussion on the
 
01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:28.370 align:start position:0%
any other comments or discussion on the
motion

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%

small group of individuals and and I'm
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
not saying that in any disparaging way I
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
just don't think it's as popular as it
 
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:09.900 align:start position:0%

you know if you're gonna put this in as
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
establishing it as a religion you would
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%

much Mr chairman uh
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
for me it's pretty convoluted you're
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
gonna you're gonna go tell the internal
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
revenue revenue service you're going to
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
tell them don't be doing what you're
 
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
doing or
 
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
it poses questions to the Internal
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue Service uh a resolution will do
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
that I know what's going to happen to
 
01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:47.219 align:start position:0%
this house resolution if it should pass
 
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
when it gets to uh Internal Revenue
 
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
Service it's going to be a circular file
 
01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:56.219 align:start position:0%
so let's let's get rid of it right now
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
before and and representative Gerhart
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
can bring something else or explain it
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
even better
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%

to be palatable from for me to
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%

01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
questions of the IRS they should be
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
asked lots of questions
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
could you could you repeat that I want
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're interested
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to asking these
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
questions from uh presented by the bill
 
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'll make one comment uh this measure
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
had something like 23 whereas which is
 
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
typical of a resolution whereas this
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
where is that and a lot of the whereas
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
is uh I agreed with but uh not all 23 of
 
01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.250 align:start position:0%
is uh I agreed with but uh not all 23 of
them

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um some of the whereas is uh I I wasn't
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh in sync with and uh so I guess the
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
point is uh if any anyone is ever doing
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
resolution uh if you're going to have
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
20s with 30 whereas you want to make
 
01:27:27.729 --> 01:27:27.739 align:start position:0%
sure I would recommend that those
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
whereases are where whereas that people
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
can uh agree agree on
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
