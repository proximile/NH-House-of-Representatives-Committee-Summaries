done a done audit and uh released
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners
 
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
we we just had a one year anniversary on
 
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
this audit back in december
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
all of our observations are in the hands
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
of the board as well as oplc
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
they have provided responses to us on
 
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
some of them and they just got
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
possession of the last batch within the
 
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
last couple of weeks
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
the responses that we've gotten back
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
we're trying to reconcile and work with
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
them to help them better understand
 
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
where we're coming from
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
as well as help them to
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
respond more appropriately if i can put
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
it that way to make sure they're
 
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
addressing the recommendations and they
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
understand them
 
00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
and again because this encompasses both
 
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.550 align:start position:0%
and again because this encompasses both
the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
board operations as well as it goes into
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
many areas of oplc
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
it's going to be another lengthy report
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
i think we have about 30 some odd
 
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.390 align:start position:0%
i think we have about 30 some odd
observations

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
observations
 
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.589 align:start position:0%
observations
and

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
so we're attempting to work with the
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
board uh there's look there is a little
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
bit of frustration on their part being
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with the process
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
as and the fact that they are part-time
 
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
board members and understanding things
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
work with them and and work through it
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
um so that's uh our hope is that at some
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
point this spring we'll be able to tie
 
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
it up and and present it um to fiscal
 
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.350 align:start position:0%
it up and and present it um to fiscal
so

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
i have a package here for you
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
is the problem the board or is the
 
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
is the problem the board or is the
problem

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.909 align:start position:0%
problem
oplc

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
i would say right right now
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't i i i don't i i'm careful to
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
use the word problem
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
because it may just be an educated an
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
education process on their part or just
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
not really understanding what their
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
understanding their control environment
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
or lack thereof and what should be
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
i would say oplc i think gets it it's
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
largely the board board members and of
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
course they meet once a month and so
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get them to
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
convene and to
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
work through these issues
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
third on the list there is the mental
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
health workforce requirements uh if if
 
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
the committee remembers you approved
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
that topic and gave it to us last last
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
meeting and then fiscal subsequently
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
approved that so
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
we are currently
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
scoping that out and
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
beginning some planning for that so at
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
our next meeting we'll have a scope
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
statement for you to approve on that
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
topic and then the fourth one is the um
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
according to chapter law is the uh
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
review i guess or
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
a special project that we're doing on
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire retirement system in
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
the health care subsidy
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're close to the end on that we've
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
drafted a report we're just reviewing it
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
now maybe a couple of outstanding
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions with department administrative
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
services and new hampshire retirement
 
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.749 align:start position:0%
services and new hampshire retirement
system

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
but we're we should be
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
within the next month hopefully
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
bringing that letter to
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
to my kane and then subsequently to the
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee so
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
so in terms of our current ongoing
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
audits that's that's a quick update
 
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.110 align:start position:0%
audits that's that's a quick update
um

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
on topic number three what you you'll

with a few options in the back of a
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
performance audit like how we could
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
approach with a performance audit
 
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
seek a much broader scope than just the
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%

and you may have discovered some of the
issues

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
um there's basically three of those
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
um but we were feeling from the this
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee that um
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted a little bit broader look at
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
special education in in general
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
so we prepared this uh pre-scope
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
statement with
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
frequency of the disability on table one
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
gives you an idea of what the
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities that the
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
children are dealing with
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
the bureau of special education support
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
organization within the department of
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
education that oversees most of the
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
special ed programs
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
within the bureau of special education
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
support there are three offices the
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
office of finance and data management
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
the office of special special education
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
training and monitoring
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the office of special programs
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
and within those there's a little
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
description of each
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
on page two i can go over those if you'd
 
00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
on page two i can go over those if you'd
like

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay the office of finance finance and
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
data management
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
deals with all the federal grants for
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
special education in the state
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements
 
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.750 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements
and

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire special education
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
information system
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're also responsible for all the
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
data that's that is uh maintained by the
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
bureau of special education services
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and they they
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
create and submit the state performance
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
plan and
 
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
plan and
audit

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
performance report for the u.s
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
the office of special education training
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
and monitoring
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
they train field relate fields related
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
to special education those would be the
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
i was involved a few years on
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
as you know the charter schools don't
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
have special ed sections
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
so it's responsibility of the sending
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
district to provide the special ed
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's been kind of a problem area and
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
i would like kind of a little closer
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
examination within that
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
bureau on that because i think that
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of arrangements some
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
work very well together the district and
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
the and the um
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the charter school in other cases
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
they seem to be putting up road blocks
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
and making difficulties and
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's overseen enough
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
from what i've heard when i hit a
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee on this anyway
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
just i want to mention that
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
as a side area to look at in those areas
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you john okay i i think that's
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
something that can be looked at
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
we have as steve mentioned we have sort
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
of a menu
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
of audit
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
topics that you could look at
 
00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.870 align:start position:0%
topics that you could look at
um

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
they're numbered a through d
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
a is the alternative dispute resolution
 
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
a is the alternative dispute resolution
audit

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
that focuses pretty strongly just on the
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
we can add on to that item b
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the costs of special ed
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
the performance audit there would look
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
at the resources and uses of special ed
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
funds and the efficiency and
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of does management of the
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
special ed costs in new hampshire
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
grant management collection of financial
 
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.750 align:start position:0%
grant management collection of financial
data

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
from local school districts and other
 
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:33.990 align:start position:0%
from local school districts and other
entities

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
we last did a performance audit in that
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
area in 1999
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
so it's been quite a while
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
since we've done anything there
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
that could be done in conjunction with
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
the next item or it could be done
 
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.509 align:start position:0%
the next item or it could be done
independently

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
independently
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
the next item is
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
data collection and analysis
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's also through the office of
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
financial and data management
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
the statute requires that the doe or
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
collect organize and analyze data about
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
and that involves they primarily oversee
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
special education information system
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
which i don't believe has ever been
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of an important
 
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of an important
project

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
i think this answers uh representative
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
weiler's uh question
 
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
weiler's uh question
um

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
statute requires the uh division of
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
learning services or learning support
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
to help school districts meet their
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities regarding special ed
 
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.949 align:start position:0%
responsibilities regarding special ed
students

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
develop and analyze information on
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
issues and problems of regional and
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
statewide importance
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
assist school districts in managing
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
these issues and monitor and maintain
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
information about national and regional
 
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.150 align:start position:0%
information about national and regional
trends

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
trends
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
that would be more of a generally
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
focused audit on
 
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
focused audit on
the

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
not just the bureau of special ed
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
services but a larger one
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with special ed that cross-cuts
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
the different bureaus
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that's something that could
 
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.030 align:start position:0%
and i think that's something that could
be

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
that could focus on
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
the charter
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
the charter and local school district
 
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.350 align:start position:0%
the charter and local school district
difficulties

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.230 align:start position:0%
so we have
um

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
there's lots of different ways we can
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
take this you can select one or two or
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
more off of the menu here
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
or we can do
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
something more specific that you request
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's really up to you how you want
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
us to so here's what the study committee
 
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.389 align:start position:0%
us to so here's what the study committee
uncovered

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
uncovered
 
00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
uncovered
was

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
we took testimony and i gave you the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
binder i had a testimony a four-inch
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
binder and not a happy story in the
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
whole binder right
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
and what appears to be happening
 
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.389 align:start position:0%
and what appears to be happening
is

00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
that in combination with
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
a law firm and the school districts
 
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
a law firm and the school districts
they

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
seem to ally themselves together against
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
and the wholes the whole scenario as
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
this the parents get discouraged and
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
beaten down until they give up
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then that seems to be
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
how we've satisfactorily
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
respond resolution in the special
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
education process
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
so in the meantime we have
 
00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:32.470 align:start position:0%
so in the meantime we have
hundreds

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds
 
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.269 align:start position:0%
hundreds
of

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
little children who get to be bigger
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
children who
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't learn how to read
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
and become unemployable
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
for some reason we're spending a lot of
 
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.870 align:start position:0%
for some reason we're spending a lot of
money

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
to produce the very
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
large number of unemployable
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
adult human beings
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that's the
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
purpose of our requesting this audit is
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
to find out what's going on there and
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
what are the incentives that cause this
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
to happen to all these children
 
00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:08.230 align:start position:0%
to happen to all these children
so

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're the guys
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
to get to the bottom of this
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
however far you have to take it
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
but this is a very expensive and serious
 
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.550 align:start position:0%
but this is a very expensive and serious
problem

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
for all of these families and all of
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
these children and all the well-meaning
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
people working in the education system
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
trying to educate
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
people who are difficult to educate
 
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.389 align:start position:0%
people who are difficult to educate
and

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
because a parent gives up
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
is not a successful resolution to the
 
00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:43.350 align:start position:0%
is not a successful resolution to the
problem

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
so we need to find out what's
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on there so that we can do
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
something about it
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
to stop this from happening
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
but we can't just somebody suggested
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
they said well just build another prison
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
for them and just put them in the prison
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
because they're only going to get in
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
trouble the rest of their life anyway so
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
at least we'll keep them warm and dry
 
00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
at least we'll keep them warm and dry
and

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and dressed and give them some
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
meaningless occupation
 
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.829 align:start position:0%
meaningless occupation
but

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
this can't go on like this
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
you just can't have all these people
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
at loose ends because
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
they can't read they can't
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
do the math they don't understand the
 
00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:24.389 align:start position:0%
do the math they don't understand the
science

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
and because they've been oftentimes
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
kept in a separate room in the school
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
where they can apparently play video
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
games or watch television but just don't
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
disturb the regular classroom
 
00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
disturb the regular classroom
so

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
what we can do about the lack of people
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
that are able to train people
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's also a problem for the college
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
and university systems because they're
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
not producing people
 
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
not producing people
and

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
we need to know what what's going on
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
besides how successful the law firms are
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's not a satisfactory resolution to
 
00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:04.789 align:start position:0%
that's not a satisfactory resolution to
this

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
so i leave that in your able hands
 
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
so i leave that in your able hands
senator

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman totally concur
 
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.429 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman totally concur
i'm

00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
curious and more than curious i think we
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
need to figure out what what are the
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
metrics that we use
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
to evaluate the system and also to
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
evaluate your success in in
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
in you know bringing back a report that
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
both identifies the project the problems
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh you know for us
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
with in a way that we can address them
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislatively if necessary so i'm not
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
sure what the metrics would be and maybe
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
john the study might provide some
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
guidance on that
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to say
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
letter a dispute resolution process and
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
the mediation process when you
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
when you do the
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
audit of this section which i would
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
in your mediation on the second and
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
third lines
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
well first through third it says in
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
mediation either party may be
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
accompanied and advised by individuals
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
with specific knowledge or training with
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
respect to the needs of children and
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities is there a way to some of
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
senator reagan's points for us to look
 
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.029 align:start position:0%
senator reagan's points for us to look
at

00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
and count
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
for these mediation processes
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
who is coming
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
for the child
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
and and the parent or the guardian and
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
who is coming on the other side and and
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
who these um
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
special knowledge individuals are
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
so that we can see
 
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.549 align:start position:0%
so that we can see
or

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
to what all of the the four inch binder
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
said is that these parents don't have
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
the special knowledge that they need and
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's very expensive
 
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
it's very expensive
to

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
go out and look for an individual to
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
advocate for your child's behalf on what
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
in the school should be doing that to
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
begin with so i want to look at what
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
who's coming to these meetings and
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
and is it a is it a balanced and fair
 
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
and is it a is it a balanced and fair
and

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.270 align:start position:0%
and
process

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
um when i that's i had that same
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
question as i was writing this
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
background here
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
and uh i went to the the department of
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
education website and i was looking for
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
that information at least give give me
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
an idea of how many how many mediations
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
do they have how many dispute resolution
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
hearings do they have and i couldn't
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
find any of that on their website
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist there
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
and it and i would presume it exists at
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
the department level
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
but we base when we write these we write
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
them on public information that's
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
available um on the web or other sources
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
the laws
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
um so we haven't contacted the
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
department of education yet that would
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
be part of the audit topic that we would
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh go and find that information out and
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
we would present that in the audit
 
00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:10.470 align:start position:0%
we would present that in the audit
report

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get your answers
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
from the department of education
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
because they're in self-protect mode
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
about a lot of this
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner's not aware a lot of what
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
karen

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
karen
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is very difficult
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
is the rules
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
that are part of idea
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know the the federal law
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
and that in fact
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
is what is causing a lot of this to
 
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
is what is causing a lot of this to
occur

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.190 align:start position:0%
occur
because

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
the school system can always say well
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
id idea says this
 
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.789 align:start position:0%
id idea says this
therefore

00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
 
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.390 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
to

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm not even sure that there's
 
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.990 align:start position:0%
and i'm not even sure that there's
anyone

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
at the state level who is an advocate
 
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.630 align:start position:0%
at the state level who is an advocate
for

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
the parents in this regard
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
because if you if you don't understand
 
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.430 align:start position:0%
because if you if you don't understand
idea

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
and you don't understand where
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know what what they're saying
 
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
you know what what they're saying
then

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the disputes generally end up negative
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
for the child
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
 
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.789 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
so

00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
one of the issues i think
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
is there 30 000 students
 
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.310 align:start position:0%
is there 30 000 students
29

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
that are receiving special education
 
00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:58.789 align:start position:0%
that are receiving special education
services

00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
that that's a that's a lot of
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of students
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
obviously we're doing well by some
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
i think trying to sort out
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
uh this population
 
00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:16.950 align:start position:0%
uh this population
and

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't turn our back on these
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
but another
 
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.669 align:start position:0%
but another
topic

00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
that i hope that we do pick up on is if
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
we haven't looked in 22 years
 
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
we haven't looked in 22 years
at

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
how the various sources of funds that go
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
how

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
it fits into the overall
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
delivery now i think that that's an
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
important feature
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
we know that i mean you're going to find
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
out that it costs
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars above
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
whatever we're paying per student
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
for special education per special
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
education student
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
and where those dollars are coming from
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think is a important
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
matter for us to understand
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
so i hope that you will pick up i hope
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
this this committee will encourage at
 
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.110 align:start position:0%
this this committee will encourage at
least

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
part b
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
which probably requires part c to go
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh so that we
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
this this
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
we just ought to have a policy policy
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
ought to be based on on some of the data
 
00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:44.470 align:start position:0%
ought to be based on on some of the data
that

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully get out of this system
 
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully get out of this system
uh

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
and from the department and from the
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.789 align:start position:0%
and from the department and from the
districts

00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
because clearly we know that there are
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
29 000 students here
 
00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:57.269 align:start position:0%
29 000 students here
uh

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
all right i think that
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
so i mr chairman i hope that will
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
empower the
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
auditors to
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
delve into this not just on the
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
complaint side but on the overall volume
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
the sources of funds that we're putting
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
towards it the data that we collect and
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
need in order to con to develop good
 
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.750 align:start position:0%
need in order to con to develop good
policy

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
senator dallas andrew thank you mr
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just a question of the of
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
the data that's been presented
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
these numbers came from the from the
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
department of education yes they did and
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
how how do they how do they
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
get this data what's it what's what's
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
their methodology to make sure that
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
these things are
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
properly reported and they're properly
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
identified that's a very good question
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm afraid i don't have an answer
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
for you that's one of the things that we
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
would determine during the audit
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
is what is the reliability of this data
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
and where the what are the sources it
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
at some level it's got to come from the
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
so how is it tailored up when it gets to
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
the state department of education
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
i i think that would be fundamental
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
the validity of this data and how these
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
categories uh have been selected uh for
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
for people now i i see deaf and blind as
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
7 17.
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a program at the
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
interest of a definite deaf and hard of
 
00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:26.950 align:start position:0%
interest of a definite deaf and hard of
hearing

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
we have a full section of the school
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's allocated this we used to take
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
students from the outside
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
so i think there's there seems to be an
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistency here but i think
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
if you could focus in on that i mean
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
that's the base of the audit the audit
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
has to be derived
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
from the people that we're serving
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
and if we know who we're serving and
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
then then i think we could attempt to
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
serve them properly but if they're not
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
properly identified then
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
it goes back to what you said john they
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
put them they just throw them to the
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
side right and they're still passing
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
kids through
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay and uh you know just uh promoting
 
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.470 align:start position:0%
okay and uh you know just uh promoting
them

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
based on time thank you mr chairman
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
senator guido
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i look at the data
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's presented 29 195 children
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
out of an 80 000 student population so i
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
would have to assume that some of these
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
children are receiving multiple of these
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
i refuse to believe that 37 and a half
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
percent of our school children are in
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that would be something in terms of
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
the data uh again
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
i have to be
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
i just out of 160
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
160 it's still a high percentage it's 15
 
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.230 align:start position:0%
160 it's still a high percentage it's 15
yeah

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it is
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
i thought it was eighty thousand
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
no it's 160 000 students
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
down from 200 000 about
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
12 15 years ago my mistake but still
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
high percentage
 
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
high percentage
yeah

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.630 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's what a serious problem it is
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh if i if i could if i could mr
 
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.549 align:start position:0%
uh if i if i could if i could mr
chairman

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.909 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
everything that
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
is in this proposal is extremely
 
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:14.549 align:start position:0%
is in this proposal is extremely
important

00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is how long do we want this
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
audit to take
 
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.269 align:start position:0%
audit to take
okay

00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
a b c and d
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
in my humble opinion
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
in order for them to do a good job it's
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
going to take them two years just to
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
to get to it
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
to get through all of it
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
and if if that's what we want
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a problem with that
 
00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:51.029 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a problem with that
but

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of stuff here and if you
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
know i don't know how familiar you are
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
with special ed but um
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's a rabbit hole that has no
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
has no bottom
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
so anyhow i just i just ask if we
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
how far do we want them to go
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
i would not like to see them proceed
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
only just far enough to not reach a
 
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.590 align:start position:0%
only just far enough to not reach a
conclusion

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
and it's been 23 years
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
right so maybe two years
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
i mean that's absolutely fine i just i
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
just don't want us to get our
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
expectations up
 
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
expectations up
that

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to get this in six months
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to happen
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's important enough that we
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't need to try to rush it because
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
yeah okay that's fine i just i agree i
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
think in the past 23 years it's really
 
00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:50.389 align:start position:0%
think in the past 23 years it's really
grown

00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
grown
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
in the past 23 years what i see is a big
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
growth in the bureaucracy
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
at the local levels i mean
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
in some school districts that
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
the staff almost
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
is equal to the number of
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
coded students that getting a little out
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
of hand
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey thank you mr chairman
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative umberger's
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
point could we break this up into two
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
separate audits do a as one
 
00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.070 align:start position:0%
separate audits do a as one
um

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.430 align:start position:0%
um
no

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't do that based on the look on
 
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
your face mr chairman i'm assuming now
 
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.190 align:start position:0%
your face mr chairman i'm assuming now
[Laughter]

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
so i had the good fortune once upon a
 
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.630 align:start position:0%
so i had the good fortune once upon a
time

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
to be interviewed in the preliminary
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
interviews for a performance audit
 
00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:49.750 align:start position:0%
interviews for a performance audit
and

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
it wasn't quite like
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
being in the back room at the police
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
station but it was a pretty intense
 
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.750 align:start position:0%
station but it was a pretty intense
process

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
and i said
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
you know there is a skill to this
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
so it was mr clinch that did the
 
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:05.909 align:start position:0%
so it was mr clinch that did the
interview

00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
interview
 
00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:07.990 align:start position:0%
interview
smiling

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
smiling
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
but they're they're good people to allow
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
them to follow their nose and find
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
find the correct conclusion so
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
if if i may um i can repeat back some of
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
what i've heard
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
i hear loud and clear that there's an
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
interest in dispute resolution and i
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
think that's something that can be done
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
pretty focused and fairly quickly
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
as a stand-alone audit
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
and then the other part is
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
more of a general
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
special ed audit that looks at costs
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
looks at how ieps are formed in the
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
support that the department of education
 
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
support that the department of education
uh

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
uh
provides

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
provides
 
00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
provides
um

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
to the local school districts and and
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
that would be more of a broader spectrum
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
of of looking more in depth at the
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
special ed system
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a separate audit and
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
that would take a little bit longer but
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
you could have your fairly focused and
 
00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:12.389 align:start position:0%
you could have your fairly focused and
uh

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution audit done first
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could you could turn us
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
loose on the more general
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
if that would you're being be your
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
advice to how do we get to
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
answers to questions
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
how do we stop this
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
waste of human talent
 
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.590 align:start position:0%
waste of human talent
from

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
being eaten up by a
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
system that
 
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.509 align:start position:0%
system that
doesn't

00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:49.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't
operate

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
to the most benefit to their customers
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
which are too young and too small to
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
so so you're pitting parents against law
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
does not come out good
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
if i made mr truman i think
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
i kind of concur with um
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
with john that i think
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
to help the committee at least begin to
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
get some answers quicker
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
we could do this dispute resolution
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
process but as we gain understanding and
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
get more information
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing the other concerns the other
 
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.389 align:start position:0%
recognizing the other concerns the other
questions

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
we can certainly start with that and
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
then as we get further down the road if
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
if it would seem like
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively we can
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
incorporate some of these other concerns
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
into the audit we can
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
come to you and ask ask for the topic to
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
be expanded
 
00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:45.750 align:start position:0%
be expanded
or

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
again as subsequent when we finish this
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
one we can move on to
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
that other area so it is a
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's something that we can come back to
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
you and and
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
you can certainly expand the scope once
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
you approve it we're gonna have to come
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
back with the scope statement anyways
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
once we begin to interact with the with
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
the agency at that point based on our
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
understanding we can
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation that we also
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
incorporate perhaps some of these other
 
00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:13.110 align:start position:0%
incorporate perhaps some of these other
concerns

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
if it makes sense
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
the behavioral problem children
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
seem to produce the most disputes
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
because they're very difficult to work
 
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.470 align:start position:0%
because they're very difficult to work
with

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
and very hard to see any light come
 
00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:30.789 align:start position:0%
and very hard to see any light come
through

00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
through
so

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the binder you've got
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
access to
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
some pretty damaged witnesses
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
being parents of special needs children
 
00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:44.310 align:start position:0%
being parents of special needs children
so

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
if you can address them you can find out
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
the areas of most concern i'm sure
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of areas that
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
are not of concern that they are able to
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
handle and help the children adjust to
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
khan

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
khan
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh and
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
respecting the uh
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
ideas that were
 
00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:13.430 align:start position:0%
ideas that were
presented

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
by our auditors
 
00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
by our auditors
um

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
i would hope that the scope statement
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
would cover a b and c
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
you could indicate that there is an
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
interim report that is
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
but i think in order for us to
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
i just would hate to see us
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
say that we can
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
look at one part here and and and arrive
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
at good conclusions without having
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
okay so what are the funding sources
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
how are how are they derived how are
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
they distributed
 
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.829 align:start position:0%
they distributed
allocated

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:53.190 align:start position:0%
allocated
uh

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
maybe pick up on on
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative weiler's question about
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh charter
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
students and because they're clearly in
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
and and what the data
 
00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.230 align:start position:0%
and and what the data
uh

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.349 align:start position:0%
uh
systems

00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
allow us to look at on a recurring basis
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
so i i think if
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
i would hope that you'd come back with
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
something that's comprehensive just
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
indicated you'd have a report
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
anyone else before we
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
are we then going to do the suggested
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
does that require emotion or we just let
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
well i guess i guess that's the question
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman is is do you want
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
us to
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
do some more digging before you
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
officially give us a topic to present to
 
00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
officially give us a topic to present to
fiscal

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
or do you
 
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.550 align:start position:0%
or do you
or

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
in other words is the committee
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
ready to give us
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
the question to be answered or the topic
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we can then go to fiscal and
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually begin i think we could use more
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
information because this is
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
and this is a very broad topic
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
and it touches on a lot of
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
happy spots and a lot of sore spots and
 
00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:27.349 align:start position:0%
happy spots and a lot of sore spots and
so

00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:34.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
so we'll meet again here for scope
 
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.270 align:start position:0%
so we'll meet again here for scope
statement

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.280 --> 00:37:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
next we have weatherization and
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
fixed-wing aircraft
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
those uh the committee at prior meetings
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
just kind of tabled those but didn't
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
like do away with them
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
um i will and at the back of your
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
package i think in particular address
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
senator geider's
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
questions or requests um there's some
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
information um
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
and steve lavoy from department of
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
safety is here so he'd be happy to walk
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
you through
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
the memo and some of the data that
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
he provided to us and to you the
 
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.150 align:start position:0%
he provided to us and to you the
committee

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
so that that's up to you but uh our goal
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
is to get at least one or two two topics
 
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.310 align:start position:0%
is to get at least one or two two topics
so

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
beyond these um we're not aware of any
 
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
beyond these um we're not aware of any
other

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
so think of things in your committees
 
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.310 align:start position:0%
so think of things in your committees
now

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
that don't seem to be working quite
 
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
that don't seem to be working quite
right

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
and propose
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair members of the
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
committee steve lavoy director of
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
administration for the department of
 
00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:31.430 align:start position:0%
administration for the department of
safety

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
tries to start
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion related to the benefits
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
and risks of owning versus leasing the
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'll summarize it for you
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
the reality is is it's a complicated uh
 
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.829 align:start position:0%
the reality is is it's a complicated uh
question

00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
and there are i kind of view two sides
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
to the coin one there's a fiscal
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
component um which which option is the
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
least expensive but then the second side
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
is there's an operational component
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
and what type of operational impact
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
would one decision have over the other
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
so currently the state police own their
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
fixed-wing cessna 182-t
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
aircraft and that's used for
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
aircraft enforcement activities
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the benefits of owning the
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
aircraft is that there are no limits on
 
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.950 align:start position:0%
aircraft is that there are no limits on
hours

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
if you lease an aircraft much like a
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
like a motor vehicle there's often hour
 
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.630 align:start position:0%
like a motor vehicle there's often hour
limits

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
limits
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then the cost structure built over
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
over time if you exceed those at those
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
yearly hour limits
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
those don't exist with the owned
 
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.190 align:start position:0%
those don't exist with the owned
aircraft

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
aircraft
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
you also control your maintenance
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
evolutions those typically would be at
 
00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:50.870 align:start position:0%
evolutions those typically would be at
the

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
discretion of the
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
lessor on when those maintenance have to
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
occur some obviously have to happen
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
based on hours
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
of use and and must occur others are
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
more discretionary
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then finally there's direct control
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
over operations
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
that state police currently
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
have over their existing owned
 
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
have over their existing owned
plane

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
plane
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
they would lose some of that option from
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
a leased perspective because of those
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance intervals that might be
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
required by contract
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
another consideration has to do with uh
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
leasing out the entire operation so not
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
just the aircraft and the maintenance
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
but also the pilots
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's some concerns there with
 
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
there's some concerns there with
availability

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
there's some concerns there with the
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
what type of of pilot you're you're
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
receiving from the vendor you can't
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
typically in those arrangements choose
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
if you prefer pilot a over pilot b uh
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
when an operation uh needs to be needs
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
to be flown uh and the other issue there
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
might be whether or not we can afford a
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
lease that would allow for 24 7 response
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
operations from a pilot perspective
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
so these these are all unknown costs at
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
this point we have not done any formal
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
request for information
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
from any any available
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
aircraft leasing companies
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
we did
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
do some initial uh review to see if
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
there were any planes available that
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
would meet our needs it does not look
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
like there
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
there are many i'm not saying there
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
aren't any i'm sure that we could find
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
some but it doesn't look like there's a
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
significant leasing market for the type
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
of plane that we currently operate there
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
are other types of planes that are
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
available and we'd have to determine if
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
those would fit our operating needs
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then finally there was some initial
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
research done
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
with other state police and city police
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
departments of
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
similar size
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
to state police
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
maryland state police delaware state
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
police new york city police and san
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
diego police department
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
all of them own and operate their their
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
planes in the same way that new
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police currently does
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
so whether or not there's a practice in
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement of leasing
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
we'd have to do more research this is a
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
very small sample
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
but i do think that um
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
industry by industry it's probably a
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
different answer depending upon which
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
industry you're you're focused in
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
because of the limitations and benefits
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
of a lease arrangement
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
so this memo just
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
details some of those considerations um
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
some of the initial research we've done
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
so far
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
again i'd reiterate that we currently
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
own our fixed wing aircraft it was
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
purchased back in
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
2008 for four hundred thousand dollars
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
based on some web searches the
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
approximate value is is three hundred
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
and eighty thousand dollars the aircraft
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
do retain their value because of that
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance and rebuild on the engines
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
that happens occasionally or
 
00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
that happens occasionally or
periodically

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're not at this point planning on
 
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.030 align:start position:0%
we're not at this point planning on
replacing

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
replacing
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
the the aircraft but when that time
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
comes the
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
division and the department would be
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
open to looking at all options including
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
leasing including lease to own options
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
because all these factors could change
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
at that point in time
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
additional questions the committee may
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
i had an opportunity to speak to a
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
couple of troopers when we were meeting
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
in manchester that had wings on their
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
chest and
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how many of them are there
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
that are eligible to to fly these
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
airplanes or to ride along
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
so we have two civilian pilots
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
the troopers are looking for the exact
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
name tactical flight officers so they're
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
not flying the aircraft but they're in
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
the aircraft
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
communicating with the troopers on the
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
ground and operating the equipment
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
to to conduct the enforcement activity
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up one of the other things i
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
learned was that there's quite often
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
three on the ground that are involved
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
three troopers on the ground that are
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
involved in any of these things but
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
they said
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
that they kind of go after the people
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
that are going more than 80 miles an
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
hour and
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's the big ticket so that it pays
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
for this program by
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
not going after the guy that's 10 miles
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
over the speed limit or something they
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
so that's hundreds of dollars tickets
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
these ones they catch i saw the other
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
day 127 miles an hour
 
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.510 align:start position:0%
day 127 miles an hour
but

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't need an airplane to figure
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's paying for itself and i would
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
imagine you
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
if you rented an airplane did you look
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
into any of the hourly costs if you
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
rented a similar size airplane
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to find anything that
 
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.430 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to find anything that
was

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
comparable to what we currently have and
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
so we we haven't been able to go to that
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
level of detail
 
00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
level of detail
the

00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
belief on our end is that
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
when you're entering into that lease or
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
rental arrangement the costs of the
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance are going to be rolled into
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
the expense and you're going to absorb
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
those one way or the other
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
the benefit is new equipment potentially
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
at the end of that term
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
but for aircraft that are used in this
 
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.750 align:start position:0%
but for aircraft that are used in this
capacity

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
that may not be as large a benefit for
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
some other types of industries
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
would seem to be pretty limited in the
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
hours they could fly you'd need daylight
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
clear skies more or less and
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
good visibility so
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know 30 hours a month or so is about
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
what you're going to get i guess thank
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.309 align:start position:0%
anyone else
senator

00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
motion made we have a second to remove
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
this from the list i'll second it
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
and seconded by umberger
 
00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.829 align:start position:0%
and seconded by umberger
any

00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor
 
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.829 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor
opposed

00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
the weatherization program did we
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
it could it could be uh something the
 
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.829 align:start position:0%
it could it could be uh something the
air

00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
air
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
could be something the arp program could
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
throw some money at
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
keep the
 
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.309 align:start position:0%
keep the
yeah

00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
keep the windows closed
 
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.589 align:start position:0%
keep the windows closed
yeah

00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
but looking at the scope of time and so
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
on they can have to use that money and i
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
by the time we got the the audit back
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
whether it'd be much time to to put in
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
for that in the program so anyway it's
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
just a thought
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
if i might
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
i mean the weatherization program
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
something that should be audited
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
i mean it's we we are putting money
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
all the all the time into weatherization
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether it's ever been
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed or not
 
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.349 align:start position:0%
reviewed or not
but

00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know they have rules
 
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.950 align:start position:0%
you know they have rules
and

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i just think that
 
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.829 align:start position:0%
and i just think that
it

00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
it should proceed
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
so your motion is to continue the
 
00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.270 align:start position:0%
so your motion is to continue the
program

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
the audit of the program yes okay
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
we have a motion in a second to continue
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
with the weatherization audit
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
all those in favor aye aye
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
stave the way of anything else
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
we don't i will um we'll draft up a
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
letter for the fiscal meeting next month
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
and for your signature for this this
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
weatherization topic sure okay
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
seeing no further business
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
you
