00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire Community bail fund
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
began in 2018 where a 501c3 charitable
 
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
organization designed to free pre-trial
 
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors who didn't have enough money
 
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
to pay low cash bail and uh we offer
 
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
rides when possible and the project is
 
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
funded by a Grassroots bunch of
 
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
donors all members are volunteers and
 
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
listening um listening to Prior
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
discussions about Bell reform we asked
 
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
well what what is bail reform uh when
 
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
bail reform came out in 2018 we had no
 
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
business at all but by 2020 we were
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
doing bails left and right 2022 we have
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
192 bails averaging
 
00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
$428 per baill 2023 as of
 
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
926 we've done 215 bills averaging
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
bails and we've paid bails as low as $25
 
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
50 so people will be incarcerated for
 
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.470 align:start position:0%
50 so people will be incarcerated for
for

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
that most of the jails we uh deal with
 
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
72% of the jails are in uh Hillsboro
 
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
House of Correction another 10% marac
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
maybe 4% in Rockingham 3% Chester County
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
and we're kind of slowly expanding
 
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
service throughout the state but uh
 
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
biggest now most of our cases that are
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
referred to us they referred by public
 
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
defenders sometimes private criminal
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys and they generally know our
 
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
bail limits so they don't send us higher
 
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
bail cases our limits have ranged from
 
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
$250 to $2,000 depending on how much was
 
00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
in the fund and most clients are charged
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
with misdemeanors trespassing
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
shoplifting possession disorderly
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
conduct driving while licens are
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
suspended and many are arrested because
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
of outstanding warrants also common
 
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
scenario someone was arrested on a minor
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
charge two years ago well uh and missed
 
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
a court date later they may have got
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
sober or they're have work but they
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
ended up in the wrong place at the wrong
 
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
time and the police ran them and they
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
found the outstanding warrant and lone
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
behold they in
 
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
jail and many of the people we assist
 
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
are on the housed some are living with
 
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
family others couch surfing with friends
 
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
other folks get taken to treatment
 
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
centers uh for
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
sud and you know these people are being
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
locked up on minor charges even though
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
they're in some cases legally innocent
 
00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 align:start position:0%
in fact you know some of the charges of
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
the offenses that they're held on
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
pre-trial if they were guilty there
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
offense and then we we find that uh a
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
lot of our uh folks are me have mental
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
health health issues along with
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and we think what is
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
needed is stable housing Medical Care
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment instead of
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
jail we need to find a way to redirect
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
some of these people if we can carve
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
them out and and try to get them out of
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
the caral system and may try to get them
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
into a Health and Human Service System I
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
think that would be that would be solve
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
quite a few things that it will clear
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
the court dockets I mean because I think
 
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the court dockets are jammed with
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
cases like this and uh and I don't think
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
what's being done for these people in
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
jail is proper uh even with short jail
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
stay stays people can lose jet uh jobs
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
housing situations mispp and get taken
 
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
away from family
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh we had one situation
 
00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
where there was a couple who uh there
 
00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
was a outstanding DV charge on the books
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
that they had resolved and they're
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
living together and uh one gentleman he
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
got jailed because of violating the DV
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
charge um so I bailed him out two weeks
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
later the wife is in jail for the same
 
00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
thing and so so it it was something that
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
was never
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
cleared yes and then they have a seven
 
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
Monon old baby living at the nashille
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
soup kitchen so uh you know these are
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
some of the stories that we we keep you
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
know we have given people rise they've
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
shared stories with us we have uh you
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
know kept a repository of these stories
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
because we think some of the things that
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
are going on with these lower-end quotes
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
unques crimes are uh irre approachable
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we got to think of some some way
 
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
to change it uh if I can interrupt you
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
for a second do you have a list like
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
that that you could share with us of you
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
of these stories that you've kept we can
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
put that together actually I think one
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues Olivia has that okay
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
that' be great if we could all we could
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
either send it to electronically or yeah
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know the the effects of jail
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of mental health experts
 
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
feel that you know going to you know I
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
know the jails are looking to beef up
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
their mental health capacities and their
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh substance ofuse capacities but some
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
of these people are are only in jail for
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
like maybe 30 days so you got to ask
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
yourself what kind of program for these
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
folks are is really effective you know
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
you really shouldn't be going to jail to
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
get for mental health treatment or
 
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment yeah uh you
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
know it should just be a back stop and
 
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we find out is that
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of the folks that are in jail it
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
takes a while to get their medication so
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of times they miss uh their
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
medication cycle and uh it's kind of
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
disastrous you know being incarcerated
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
and and not having your medication on
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:03.469 align:start position:0%
and and not having your medication on
time

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much my statement uh my
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
other colleagues have other things but
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions for me um yeah
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
if I could if I'll start um have you had
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
an experience with any of the pre-trial
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh services in any of the counties it's
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding that we heard that some
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the pre-trial services are pretty
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
good about hooking people up with mental
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
health and things like that um I we've
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
heard about them um I think hillsbor
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
county is still trying to build that
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
capacity M but uh we're kind of like
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
remiss to get too involved with a pre-
 
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
child servic we don't want to be hired
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
by them yeah so we we don't really want
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
to become part of that system but sure
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think some of those things can be
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
good things okay and and do you have a
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
program within your organization where
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
you refer people to services for mental
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
health and substance abuse well we have
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
um we go through the Public Defense
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
venders and we do uh talk to a lot of
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
the different providers out there and
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
but usually
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
um uh we don't have any like formal
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
program set up but there is a lot of
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
different there it's fragmented with me
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
mental health and also substance abuse
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah uh providers and if if a public
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
defender is saying you know take them
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
here I just we take them there you know
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
we're going to yeah we're not going to
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
get in the middle of that I I think the
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
the committee um is is very interested
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the concept of of diversion um before
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
they get into the criminal system the
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
question we have is you know where do
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
they go um I don't believe that there's
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
any facility with enough beds to to
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
house mentally ill or substance abuse
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
patients on the scale that we're talking
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
about so are you aware of any programs
 
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
that are open that just wishing they had
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
people sent to them yeah I um I know
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
that there's a community reinvestment
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
program that's being driven by uh one of
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Court people in the in New Hampshire
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
Court system yeah and I think they're
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're attacking that problem uh
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the people that are
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
kind of like the frequent flyers for
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
these you know low-end defenses and uh
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what can be done
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know realistically we don't have
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
that kind of capacity and we just have
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
to figure figure out how to build it and
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
you know I know the criminal justice
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee and that might not be their
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
perview but you definitely I think I
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
would love to have their support in and
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
in putting something like that together
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
yeah I I believe I can speak for the
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
committee and that we we agree that U
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
mental health um mental health and
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
substance issues don't belong here but
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
but we don't know where they do belong
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
so we we want to be able to find a way
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
to to stop that but I'm not sure what we
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
can do yeah and I think one of the
 
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
latest studies they've done uh the
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
criminal justice uh organization
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the state has figure out like
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
73% of the people in jail either have
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of substance abuse or mental
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
health yeah type uh and to your earlier
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
Point um it's my understanding that if
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's for example suffering from
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia and they go in jail and
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have their medication they
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
just spiral out of control and then they
 
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
end up being cut back loose with no
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
medication and right they end up shortly
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
back in right yeah right there's not you
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
know there could be you know heavy
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
recidivism uh if you know if they miss
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
that those kinds of Cycles so and any
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
committee are you on our committee I'm a
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
substitute I don't well then go ahead I
 
00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
substitute I don't well then go ahead I
don't

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I think Mr Newman had a question
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
represent Newman had a question
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
first yeah I was just getting ready to
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
um I just the process of how people get
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
to you and whether is there a
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
differentiation between uh the days of
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
the week when someone is arrested and
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
when they get arraigned and and whether
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
they have this problem with bail or not
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
it's random we kind of hear from public
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
defenders or sometimes they come through
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
our website but more often than not it's
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
public defender you know I might have
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
an email after this meeting that there's
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
somebody that needs to be bailed out
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah representative sitech did I don't
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
see any other
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
questions how many people show for court
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
have you lost do you lose bails yeah we
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
we took um
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh the stats on that and we get about
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
85% people come back we make it clear
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
when we talk to them that it's important
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to help somebody else uh
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
show off a court of course there are
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
people that just jump and don't come and
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
but but one of the problems is the court
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
system is so slow that it takes a long
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
time to get the money back do you do you
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
um do you keep track of your bailees to
 
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
the point where like for example there
 
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
are a lot of unhoused who won't get
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
notices in the mail or any such thing
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
like that do you try to remind them of
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
their dates or anything like that we try
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
to do that but it's very difficult
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
because if you are unhoused it might be
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
a you know families in transition or
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
asash soup kitchen and then there's
 
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
different different places that people
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
are living outside it's it is difficult
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
to we have heard that um other places
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
have tried a text messaging reminder
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
system from the courts um and it's been
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
fairly successful is it your experience
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
that most of your baes at least have
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
sometime of a cell phone yes yeah it is
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
um however a lot of times when they get
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
out their cell phone you know the the
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
cell phone's been s sitting in wherever
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
and the battery's dead and they have to
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
recharge it but um but yes I think a lot
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
of them do have cell phones and that's
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh I think that that'd be a great idea
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um any more questions
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Stone
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
my question on the bills that you
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
provide a service for what percentage of
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
those are victim crimes versus crimes
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
against the
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
state uh are you talking like
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor versus you have felony yeah
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
versus felonies or a like a domestic
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
violence type of situation I'd say about
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
70% are misdemeanors and then maybe 15%
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence things and then the
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
felonies are very kind of are not too
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
common but we do get slow bails for some
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
felonies yeah thank you you um you had
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um business died off um
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
right after the 2018 bail reform and it
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
seems to be steadily increasing again um
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
any any idea why that is that you've
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
heard yeah our research came and this
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
this is interesting because around 2020
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
we got a um a message from the managing
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
partners of the public defender saying
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
kind of asking if we were still in
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
business because in 2020 there was an
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
omnius Bill where they kind of gutted
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
the Bell Reform Bill and that's why
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
we've gone from you know last few
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
meetings I heard people talking about
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
Bill reform like it was something that
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
really existed and I'm looking looking
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
what Bill reform you know we're bailing
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
people out left and right you know so
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
what change that you aware of I think
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
they I have to go back and read it but I
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
think it enabled judges to uh take
 
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
people who were on warrants people who
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
had like uh didn't who didn't show up
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
for trial you know those kinds of things
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
if there was like a minor infraction in
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
that process then um in
 
00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759 align:start position:0%
the and then they that gave warranted uh
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh bail but you know again then you
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
think that bail is being used as
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
punishment and not as you know unless
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's for an outstanding fine right
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
that's another question so if there many
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
people are bailed and the amount of bail
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
is what they owe do you bail those
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
people and if so do you ever recoup your
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
money yeah well basically we we pay the
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
court and um and the bail the bail money
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
goes to the court when they show up for
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
trial then the money comes back to our
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
fund no I I think what I'm saying is
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
like a judge will say okay you owe $75
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
in fees if you get picked up your bail
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
is $75 that $75 goes to the court and
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't come back because that's the
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
outstanding amount you owed do you ever
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
run into that um yes I we think we we
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
we've paid some fees where somebody
 
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
didn't pay child support and those were
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
like fees we just helped the people out
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
it was like 50 bucks or 75 bucks and we
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
said Okay okay so you knew going into it
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
that that you weren't going to get that
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
money right yeah we kind of know where
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
when I think the only times we really
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
get the money back is when we pay a bail
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
a full a bail at the court and you know
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner fee if we pay a
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
baill commissioner we're not going to
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
get that back either so okay how often
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
do you pay the bail Commissioners uh
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
We've we stopped we during the week we
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
go to the court only because uh we have
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
to wait for the bail Commissioners and
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
the way it works is you got to go to the
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
jail announce yourself and then wait for
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners to show up okay
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
and so now you're waiting two or three
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
hours and maybe maybe little longer and
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh so we figured it's just much better
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
for us to go to the court okay so you
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't generally bail out people on
 
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
weekends uh no no we unless it's like a
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
a dire need you know okay all right
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and we had some situations
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
where we did try to bail people out on
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
the weekends but the bail commissioner
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't available I see okay thank you um
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
if you could give um do we have we don't
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
have any pink cards or do we have one up
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
there if you can find a pink card um I'd
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
like your contact information so that we
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
could reach back out to you sure and if
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
you could remember to send us that
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
information from the anyal studies you
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
had we'd appreciate that too thank you
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
mic I just wanted to um amplify a
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
question that Paul
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
your question um Sarah whitw from naswa
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
okay and um what the peop tell me when
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
they when I give them rides is that
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes well number one they're not
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
assigned a public defender immediately
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
so they could be in jail Friday night
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe the public defender isn't
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
assigned to them till sometime in the
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
following week then the public defender
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
has to have the time to talk or look at
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
their case and then ask us so they could
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
be in jail for a week before we get a
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
request for the release so people are
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
there for quite a long time often
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
because the the assignment of Defenders
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough Defenders so
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have to farm it out or
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
the or the Defenders don't have time to
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
get to them so they're in jail a long
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
time often and you were talking about
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
before their Defender can request the
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
bail hearing and and and get the bail
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
set well no the bail was set but the
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
defender they would they don't often
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
have a lawyer when bail is set MH so
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's no even there there it could be
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
unfair that the bail could be set higher
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
than it would be if a lawyer was there
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and then the lawyer the lawyer
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
isn't assigned to them until sometime
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
later and it could be I think sometimes
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
up to a week before the lawyer is
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
assigned and looks at their case and the
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
lawyer is the one who would refer them
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
to you yes which is why there's a gap
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
into yes I mean sometimes we do get
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
family members involved but generally
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's for higher amounts but for these
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
low amounts nobody asks us except for
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
the public defenders to help okay thank
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
much good morning my name is Andy offet
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
I live in conquer so I also a member of
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
the baale fund group and I'm an attorney
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
as well and um so I want to do a couple
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
things today um I'll I'll be brief is U
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to give some examples of
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
some people were bailing out I know you
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
had asked a lot so these are these are
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
real life examples and just kind of
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
reading you know a quick description so
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
here's someone you know uh uh held in
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County House of Correction
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
$200 cash bail for a be misdemeanor DUI
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
chart so as you know be misdemeanors
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
there is no jail time uh for that uh and
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
here's someone is held on $200 uh cash
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
bail which they you know can't afford as
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're uh reaching out to us if
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
I could just interrupt real quick um a
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
lot of those
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
cases that you're going to or that the
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
one you just read for example was that
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
the initial arrest or was that those
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
fees that why was the $200 set was it
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
set by the bail commissioner or was it
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
set at the court I believe it was set by
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner so as as Paul
 
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
alluded to you know we first find out
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
about things is from the attorney so
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
this was so this was from an attorney um
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
I I think over in Rocky yeah so this was
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
from a public defender who was referring
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
the case to us so I believe all of these
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
I am reading to you are um that we are
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
getting them uh after the bail
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner has set the bail they're in
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're in jail and before the court
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay before the
 
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
court so here's another one um I have
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
like six or seven of them and so here's
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
one that that theft bu unauthorized
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
merchandise uh has been incarcerated
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
when we got this email for a month that
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
they were picked up on 12 2822 we're
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
unauthorized taking $50 being held on
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
$300 cash bail that uh here's another
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
one and we get a lot of these are
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
Criminal Trespass uh um he's already
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
been in prison a month uh in jail a
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
month so $200 cash bail and you know a
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
lot of these are homeless as Paul talked
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
about um that uh here's one as you
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that uh so 250 cash
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
bail theft by unauthorized taking
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
pleaded guilty but did not pay
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
restitution so someone being held on
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
$250 cash because you didn't pay
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
restitution which I really don't know if
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
we have you know debtor prison if we
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
should be holding people uh for cash
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
bail for not paying uh not paying their
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
restitution um we get a lot of these you
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
know so this gentleman uh a
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
non-competent homeless harmless so this
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
is in the word of the attorney you know
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
har harmless black man who is repeatedly
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
targeted by police in charged with
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
resisting arrest been held in Valley
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
Street for six days $600 cash bail so
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
homeless uh you know been repeatedly
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
targeted but $600 cash bail that another
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
one uh held in cheser County House of
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
Correction uh for $50 cash bail that
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
that Criminal Trespass resisting arrest
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know these are sometimes the most
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
frustrating ones because for us because
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
it's $50 you know this person has no
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
money and you're just holding them for
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
$50 cash
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
bail um that uh um come back to this one
 
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
that uh um here's one where uh and I
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
know this is you know there are a lot of
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
moving parts to these folks in their
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
lives so this is someone who is uh had a
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
superior court charge that was uh it PR
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance so he could go to
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
a residential substance abuse treatment
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
but being held in marac District Court
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
for $2,000 cash bail so again you know
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what happened in these we
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened but for some
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
reason the bail commissioner you know
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
set $2 $22,000 cash and the superior
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
Court's already releasing him PR to go
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
to residential
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
are those two different two different
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
cases this is the same person it's
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
probably two different cases yes okay
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
yes so um and as you know there's a
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
story behind all of these and so um that
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh another one you know being held on
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
$50 cash bail on a a b Mr meaner case um
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
that uh here's another one that that
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
that $50 for driving air for suspension
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
charge so that um you know and I have we
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
have a long list of these things and uh
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's just uh um so I will say I I see Mr
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
Larry here this morning morning that
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
that I've met him many times at the at
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
um in BOS and he I will say he's
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
friendly he's helpful and I we always
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
pay him the $40 so whenever we see him
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
whenever we're there we always pay them
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
the $40 so I guess my my um that that my
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
questions to the committee or things to
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
think about you know is is um is what
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
types of training do the bail
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have you know I don't know
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
if this is the most recent I found
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
online the bail commissioner handbook
 
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.789 align:start position:0%
online the bail commissioner handbook
from

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
2016 so I don't know if this has been
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
updated but you know okay so so 2020 so
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's the most recent one is 3 years
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
old that um you know it clearly says in
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
the handbook I'm sure it says in the
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
2021 that that bail commissioner should
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
find and I quote the least restrictive
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
form of bail which will ensure the
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
defendants appearance in court the
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
safety of the public and the accused
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
rights to freedom and I just think as I
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
read some of these examples that in in
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
my opinion and I am a defense attorney
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
so they know have my biases but that
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
that these folks who are being held on
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
$50 or $100 or $200 are neither a a a
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
Flight Risk I mean they are homeless or
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
not going anywhere they are not a safety
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
to the public and and and uh it really
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
is very the huge rights to Freedom so I
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
just wonder you know I guess my
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions you know you know around
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
around training that consistency you
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
know we see we see a lot of these baales
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide you data there
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
really is no consistency between bail
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners between parts of the State
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh and you know and I just don't know if
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
this manual is updated that uh just so
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know and I'm sure so the whole
 
00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:58.230 align:start position:0%
you know and I'm sure so the whole
process

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know I think one of the things is
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
most frustrating is that the the
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
defendant has no advocacy at this bail
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
setting process I I assume you know that
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
the person is arrested the bail
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner gets charged in the middle
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
of gets called in the middle of the
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
night usually to come to the police
 
00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:12.919 align:start position:0%
station and my understanding is they
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
talk to the police I will say I talked
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
to one bail Commissioners this is only a
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
data point of one and literally the
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
conversation was when I walk in I ask
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
the police how the person acted was he a
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
jerk if he's a jerk I'm going to make
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
his bail higher that you know if he
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
cooperated maybe I'll make his bail
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
lower you know has nothing to do with
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
what we talked about with Flight Risk
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
safety to the public um and I and it's
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
just very concerning that these folks
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
have no there's no one advocating for
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
them they can speak for themselves maybe
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
but there's no one who really can speak
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
for them and represent them um that uh
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time I know lawyers don't
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
want to get called in the middle of the
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
night either so so um but I just think
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
that uh the system is calling for you
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
know possibly more training and more
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
consistency you know in in in baale
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
setting so um I can stop and take
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
questions I wanted to address also one
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
other completely different subject on
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
the the bill 38 I can do that now or do
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
it after your questions go ahead so um
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
if I understand the bill so this is the
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
one that's going to change the burden of
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
proof um for I guess it's for baales
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
from clear and convincing to
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence and I guess
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
the one thing I I uh caution against and
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
this is from my own experience is that
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
um so in the state prison at the parole
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
board so for parole revocation the it it
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
is preponderance of the evidence but as
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know in Criminal Court it is beyond
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
a reasonable doubt and I've had two
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
clients already that have been they're
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
on parole from the state prison they've
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
been picked up uh for something that uh
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice system the
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
charge has been dropped because the
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
state cannot meet the burden of of
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt however in the
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
parole board because it's a lower
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
standard they are found guilty and they
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
do have to serve time and stay prison so
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
so they're violated on their original
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
parole they're violing on the original
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
parole they get like a 90-day setback
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know it depends what it was but a
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
90-day setback so in essence you have
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
people who are um who are uh having to
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
serve another 90 days in state prison
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
for something as far as the criminal
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
justice system is concerned they didn't
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
even do and they're not being charged
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
for because the bird is higher so I just
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
think it's tricky to have two you know
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
so as you know even for many of these
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
clients these are criminal charges it is
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
it is beyond a reasonable doubt I know
 
00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%
you you know clear convincing it's a
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
current Stander which is slightly below
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
but I just think it's dangerous to take
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
it too far below because you could have
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
people being held on bail because it
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
meets the preponderance standard but not
 
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
having not going to be incarcerated
 
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:43.519 align:start position:0%
because it won't meet the criminal
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
standard a Beyond A Reasonable Doubt do
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
that make sense what I it does um I
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
guess the the debate would be at what
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
point does the Beyond a reason doubt get
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
triggered and it doesn't until you're in
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
front of a jury or a judge for a trial
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
right um and and you have of um the
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of be incarcerated on this
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's a question of being it should be
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
Flight Risk or danger Flight Risk or
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
danger and if those are the two
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
standards the it's debatable whether
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
preponderance right when we get into
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
dangerousness I don't know that um
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
keeping at a higher standard you have to
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
balance between the safety of the public
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
and the rights of the defendants so it's
 
00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0%
a it's a tough tough conversation we'll
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
be having yes yes yes as you know you
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
just don't want to be incarcerating
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
people pre-trial for something that when
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
you get to trial it's probably there's
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be prison time for
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
agree anyway I know I bounced around a
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
lot so but I'm happy to take questions
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
any questions from the commit uh
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'd
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
like to go back to the class be
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for DWI were there any
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances that were unique in that
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
case that you're aware
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
of I don't know I mean we literally you
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
know that um that uh and again I know
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
there's so if you could see so the this
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
is the whole message we got from the
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
public defender you know that good
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon I represent a client who's
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
currently held in Rockham County House
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
of Corrections $200 cash bail her
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
charges a misdemeanor B DUI charge for
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
which she cannot receive jail time to
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
send her she would be convicted and then
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
they give her name and docket number and
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's all we that's all we know
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
about this follow up on that yeah uh I
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
guess thinking back a Class B misor
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
really doesn't care any jail time and I
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
know that state of New Hampshire in the
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
last 20 years changed it from a
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
violation offense up to the class B but
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
in addition uh the only foreseeable
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
circumstance I might possibly see is a
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
defendant that refused to cooperate with
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
either the bail process or the booking
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
process at the time of arrest due
 
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
possibly to intoxication I didn't know
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
if those factors could have been at play
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
in this case so I guess I'd say I have
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
no idea but I guess I would just push
 
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:49.519 align:start position:0%
back that even if they did not cooperate
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
with the bail commissioner is is the
 
00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:52.519 align:start position:0%
next step you're going to say that this
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
person's you know because the criteria
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
is Flight Risk and safety to the public
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
so I guess is the Assumption going to be
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
if someone does not cooperate with a
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner that they are a risk
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
of safety to the public because I don't
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
make that leap and so I still don't see
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
how how if they are you know less
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
cooperative and I will say you know it
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
is it is very intense for these people
 
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0%
to be in a police station in front of
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
police uh so yes sir just as a quick
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
followup maybe we could hear from the
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
bill Commissioners to see how they
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
handle those individuals that refuse to
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the officers of the Court
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
yes sir I just have a quick question you
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
you had a lot of cases and you were
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
referring constantly to bail
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
Commissioners do you get much business
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
when it's a judge that makes these
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
decisions so again that that most of our
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
uh Outreach is from the public def
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
public defender so many times sometimes
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
what will happen is that um the bail
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
will be set very high the the the they
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
will the next day or two they'll get
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
before a judge the bail sometimes the
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
judge will lower the bail and then
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
they'll reach out to to us to pay the
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
bail if that answers your question so we
 
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
don't yeah so um it's it's all driven
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
our process is really driven by when we
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
hear from the public defender we need
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
help for my client thank
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
you so just to follow up on his question
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
just so the committee understands the so
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
someone will get arrested say on an oui
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
Friday they're in jail they get to court
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
they're held they get to court on Monday
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
um they're reigned or further bail
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
hearing um until an attorney is is
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
assigned one may get just assigned by
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
Thursday Thursday he may look at the
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
case and then he'll request the bail
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
hearing and at the bail hearing he may
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
get it lowered he may not if he gets it
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
lowered to within your your uh ability
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
to pay then they'll reach out to you
 
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
that's how you get
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
triggered so the whole thing the way the
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
way we find out they reach out to us so
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
many times attorneys will decide that
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go before a judge
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
they just you know will'll get emails
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
that uh that my client's being held on X
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
dollar bail that uh I don't think it's
 
00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:03.559 align:start position:0%
worth it to go before for a bail hearing
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
can you help us bail them out okay so
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's really the attorney one driving the
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
bus I'll say also we like to have the
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys involved that um that uh
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
someone to mentioned had asked a
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
question about when people show up and I
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
think by having an attorney it kind of
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know the attorney's going to keep
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
track I forget who asked a question
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
about the text you ask question about
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
the text message so attorney's going to
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on these clients too
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys want their clients to come
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
back so they're going to help us
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
uh you know you know keep an eye on
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
track down the clients make sure they
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
come back so they don't generally refer
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
people to you that they are pretty sure
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be a Flight Risk and that
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
you could lose your money well we I
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
guess we hope not but our goal is to get
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
as many people out as pre-trial
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
detention as possible okay that's our
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
goal and and we work with them and uh
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%

00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
yes and um just for anyone listening
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%

donations are tax deductible correct
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the yes represent did you
 
00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
have a question yes I did yes sir um you
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that homeless people are are
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
not a Flight
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
Risk I I would think a person that
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a house or doesn't have any
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
property and you're looking at senters
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
for time they would just take off to
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
another place and start over again
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
another state or another County so I
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
don't have data to support that our
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
experience is that people who are
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
homeless they don't have any I mean
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
they're not going they don't have the
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
they're not going anywhere I mean they
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
don't have any money for anything they
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
they they can't you know so they're just
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
trying to eat and live and pay their
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
cell phone bill I'd say that many people
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
have you know the cell phones a high
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
priority so I personally again I'm a
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
defense attorney so you could take that
 
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:27.079 align:start position:0%
I personally don't think homeless people
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
that they're the least Flight Risk I
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
would think a person that had a house
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
would be le least flight flight L they
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
have a house they're not going to take
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
off because they're looking at a
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
sentence for time so we could debate I
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
just that that you need means to you
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
need means to flee and if yes so if
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
there no means there's literally I mean
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
they literally have zero money so I
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
don't even know sort of like walking
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
walking somewhere I don't know how they
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
would even get there yeah I think the
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
days of the hobo riding the rails are
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
long past I think that is yes sir yeah
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
um no further questions thank you for
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
your testim thank so much okay do we
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
have anyone here from the defense
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
up okay all right sorry good morning
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%

sorry I was a bit late uh my name is
David

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
David
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
Rothstein um I am here uh as a
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative of the New Hampshire
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
personally um I was with the public
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
defender for over 30 years uh including
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
being one of the directors of the
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
program I am now practicing um criminal
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
law privately in exiter I have um I've
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
been here before some of you look
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
familiar to me um and I I would I think
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
most like to take your questions in this
 
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
format rather than plow over ground that
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
you've already plowed over um to try try
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
to answer some questions that that may
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
be on your mind I think that's probably
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
the most valuable I I mean I guess just
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
a couple things that really come to mind
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
quickly I our belief my belief is that
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
this the bail statute is is not really
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
the to the extent there's a problem in
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
the administration of bail and and I I
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
personally don't really think that there
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
is and I can explain why the statute is
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
is not the problem and adding more
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
language or taking more language out of
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
the baale statute is not likely to
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
produce anything different bail is you
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
know bail is it's in part governed by
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
Statute um and there are certainly the
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
the flight and the the risk of danger um
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
in part it's driven by a few things it's
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
driven by the the training the
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
experience the life experience of the
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
people who administer the statute those
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
are prosecutors those are defense
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys they're judges their bail
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I I I was in Rockingham
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
County court yesterday waiting for a
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
case I listened to to a judge do a
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
couple of bail hearings of people in
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
jail both of those people were
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
preventively detained uh but very
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully so after presentation from
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
defense after presentation from
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um after questions there's
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
there's been in in past sessions that
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
I've sat in this image that people are
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
just sort of released uh no matter what
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're really dangerous and and the
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
judge just releases them I I believe
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
that if if this committee had the
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to listen to various bail
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
sessions around the state I I I don't
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
think this committee would have the
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
impression that that is generally what
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
happens I think this committee would
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
have the impression that there are
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances where an
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
individual is released and sometimes
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'll be sitting there thinking to myself
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
boy what's the judge going to do here is
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
the judge going to release this person
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
or not um and there are certain
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the person is not
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
released but it's done so um after a
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and careful consideration of
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
the facts and circumstances as brought
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
to light by the various people involved
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
I I will say that it can be very
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
difficult as a defense attorney to get
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
some of these cases um you can be
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
notified by the court at 11 o'clock that
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's a A felonies first or soon not
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be felonies first but there's an
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
arraignment on for 1:00 uh you talk to a
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
person at the jail you try to get as
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
much information as you have um I I I
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
don't really like that I'd like to meet
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
the person I'd like to have more
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity but even then I do frankly
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
feel like whether I win or lose the bail
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
hearing I I understand why I won the
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
bail hearing and I understand why I lost
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
the bail hearing so I I don't think that
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
we have a system that is fundamentally U
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
broken um it's never going to be perfect
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
because it's going it's administered by
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know by by People Like Us who are
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
going to make some mistakes and those
 
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
mistakes can be un either side they can
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
be releasing somebody who probably in
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
retrospect should have been detained
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
they can be by detaining somebody who
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
probably in retrospect should have been
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
released those things are going to
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
happen um resources I think could be
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
brought to bear uh there's been
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
discussion in the past about Community
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
Corrections programs about how sometimes
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh those programs can allow the court to
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable releasing somebody
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
who would other otherwise might have
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
some uh reluctance about releasing um
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
there's a a situation I had in in
 
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
straford County recently a gentleman who
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
was in a really bad way using
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine primarily um committed a
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
second deegree assault domestic um he
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
was initially released on Community
 
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
Corrections and he did not do well he
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
did not report he got arrested um he got
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
brought back to jail we get an order
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
from the court um that he was only to be
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
released again if he was able to get
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
into a program um I talked to him he was
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
committed to getting into a program
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
there's a woman at the straford county
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
jail who in conjunction with community
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
corre Corrections got him into a program
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
he just completed a 28-day program he's
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
now released again on Community
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
Corrections so a county that doesn't
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
have those types of resources he'd
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
probably be sitting in jail this this
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
entire time and instead he get treatment
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
and you know fingers crossed he's
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to be out and if that
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
works then when his case comes up for
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
resolution he's going to present better
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
to the court and it may not be necessary
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
to incarcerate him either at all or for
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
as long as um otherwise might have been
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
necessary so I do think that
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
there are various ways in which
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
resources can be brought to bear um
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
failures to appear um all different
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
types of circumstances there are some
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
failures to appear where the person um
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
has lost contact with with the court for
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
a long time and it becomes to the court
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
fairly clear that if we don't detain
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
this person we're never going to see
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
them there are other situations where
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
the person has circumstances where they
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
didn't make it to court um they are
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps battling a substance use
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
disorder um as the gentleman before me
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
said I I I don't believe that people who
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
are homeless or most indigen clients
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
they don't go to Brazil um they don't
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
have the means to to flee the country
 
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:08.839 align:start position:0%
they're not that devious they're simply
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling with a lot of
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
problems and when they miss Court
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're not going very far and for the
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
most part they are not creating uh a
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
danger and they are not a True Flight
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
Risk I understand the frustration that
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
the police have have expressed when they
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
feel like they're arresting people on
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
you see and get released again um some
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
of those people should be detained some
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
of them should be released and try to
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
get them back on track and try to get
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
them into a program and I think if you
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
lay eyes on somebody if you're a judge
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
and you look into somebody's eyes and
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
you look at the defense attorney you
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
look at the prosecutor I think you're in
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
a a better position to make that
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
decision than us who don't see the
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
proceeding um and don't don't understand
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
all that was brought to bear um at any
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
time if anyone has any questions please
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
feel free to jump in sure um I would i'
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
like to comment on the portion of the
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
statute that purports to create um very
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
strong presumption of detention based
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
upon the offenses that are committed
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's a whole list of offenses from
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
first-degree murder down to some other
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
types of offenses human trafficking and
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
the like if it's murder there's a
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
separate statute that accounts for that
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's a separate detention statute
 
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.030 align:start position:0%
there's a separate detention statute
there's

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
no there's no real great I don't think
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's even possible for somebody charged
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
with murder to just be released without
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
um being detained initially under 5971 C
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
if the penalty uh the maximum penalty
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
one could receive is life without parole
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
they fall under that statute and there's
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
a whole separate procedure these other
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
types of cases I I understand the
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
inclination to say if you're charged
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
with something in particular there
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
should be a presumption that kicks in
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
and the federal statute does this to a
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
degree but you could have somebody
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
charged with burglary that's not on that
 
00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:58.839 align:start position:0%
list that should Darwell be preventively
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
detained you could have somebody charged
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
with aggravated flon of sexual assault
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
maybe it occurred allegedly back in you
 
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.470 align:start position:0%
maybe it occurred allegedly back in you
know

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
1998 um maybe the circumstances under
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
which it was reported are you know need
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
to be examined maybe the person has no
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
conceivable contact with the alleged
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
victim and is otherwise not a Flight
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
Risk not a danger to anybody else so
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
aggravated FL sexual assault is on that
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
list but that particular person it may
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
be perfectly appropriate for a bail
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
Commission or a judge to look at the
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances of course taking into
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
account the nature of the offense which
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
I think the court always does in set a
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail instead of a
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
a presumption of a A detention so I I
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't think the Endeavor to create the
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
label of the offense and match it to the
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
person um is necessarily productive um
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I think the offense is a something
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
to be taken into consideration if with
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
dangerousness it often comes into
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
consideration based on the nature of the
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
offense and the circumstances but I
 
00:45:00.549 --> 00:45:00.559 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's necessary to
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
have um a statute that that tries to
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
sort of micromanager cherry pick
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
offenses and make those particular
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
people not eligible or as eligible for
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
bail um we support bail Commissioners um
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
we think they perform an important role
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
um we don't think it's particularly
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
realistic to have a system where you're
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to have prosecutors judges and
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys um at any hour during
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
a weekend that are going to be coming in
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
we think the bail Commissioners are are
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
going to continue to be called on to
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
support that role uh we would also
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
support their uh training we would
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
support their independence from
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
influence by undue influence or or exp
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
parte influence of police or defense or
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else um we see them as being
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial officers and we would
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
support them being paid not having to
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
rely on if a defendant uh coming in at
 
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
3: in the morning has 4 $4 in his pocket
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
we would support them being paid in a
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
reliable um way if we're going to commit
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
to them which which I think fairly I
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
think we're we're going to uh we support
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
a clear and convincing evidence standard
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
as to the determinations of Flight Risk
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
and and danger uh we think that standard
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
is appropriate given the um consequence
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
um that's going to to to occur as a
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
result of the imposition of the of the
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
bail um so those were those were my
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
comments I mean I have other things I
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
can say but i' I'd be glad to take any
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has thank you um
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
I'll ask a
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
couple so what is in your practice is it
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
mostly felonies that that you take that
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
you deal with um I have I have
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors too and misdemeanor
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
defendants are held on bail yeah no I'm
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
just curious as to what your Day-Day
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
practices most felonies and misdemeanors
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
um and there are some misdemeanor
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
defendants held on bail and some felony
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
defendants not that subjectively to me I
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
say gezz that's kind of odd yeah um so
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's yes felonies and misdemeanors
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
okay um and as far as um clients who are
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
out have have you seen many of them have
 
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.710 align:start position:0%
out have have you seen many of them have
electronic

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring and to what degree could you
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
talk about that a little bit because I'm
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
interested on that as an alternative in
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
some cases the electronic monitoring I
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
think first of all I think you need a
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
Community Corrections program that can
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
administer the monitoring as you
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
probably know there's I think you I
 
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
think you have to have a third party
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
that that um is in charge of sort of
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
maintaining it and and providing the
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
signal if I'm the if I'm the monitoring
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
officer providing the signal that Joey
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
is not where he's supposed to be at a
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
particular time so um there's a cost
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
involved um it does happen in community
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
correction situations I think it most
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
often is something that is employed in
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases where there is a
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
concern that the accused may have uh
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
contact or come within a zone of
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
protection um around the UN alleged
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
victim it's not so much as I understand
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
it I don't think it's implemented so
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
much in Flight situations I think it's
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
implemented more in danger situations
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
and you know you need the you need the
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you need the the the
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
funding and you need to have a person
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
who can pay the weekly cost of it which
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what it is but it is a
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
cost to some people I know that it's um
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
used extensively in some other states
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example for parole and
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
I believe they have a a company that
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
does oversee it and notifies the parole
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
officers hey your your client is uh just
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
removed his thing or a lot of times the
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
conditions of parole will be you're
 
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to go to work and go home and
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
yes things like that um it's usually
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
tied yes it's usually tied to other
 
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:50.839 align:start position:0%
conditions a curfew you can't go like if
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
you know the the alleged victim works at
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
the Haniford in Rochester you can't go
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
go to the hord in Rochester so if if if
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's you know if you know the the
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
accused there's a you know he's within
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
the zone of the Haner and Rochester
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's a way to to to do it they'll set
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
a Geo fence that'll KCK geofence correct
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
so it's usually tied to a curfew or
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
other types of
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances um I think it's effective
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
um I was actually it's funny I had a
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing in federal court yesterday and
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's a new technology where um it's
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
something called start link and it's an
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
app on your phone and they send you um a
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh random messages at random times of
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
the day and if you don't get back to
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
them in 15 minutes with a photo of
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
yourself where you are then that
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
triggers um basically the the your
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
supervising officer to take action so
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
that was something that was discussed
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's apparently coming through the
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
pipeline um electronic monitoring I I
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
don't think it is I don't think the
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
concern is generally that the person is
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to be at Flight Risk but I suppose
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's possible too if you have a Flight
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
Risk concern and you really think that
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to go to Logan and
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
catch a flight to Bolivia then yeah that
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
would that would be something that could
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
be used for that I would just be
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
interested in the cost versus the
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
incarceration um you know if someone's
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
on that and they're worthy candidate for
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
it they'd be able to go to work and go
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
home keep their job yes does that cost
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
more or less than incarcerating someone
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
and and the effects of it well
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
definitely it's got to be less because
 
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the cost um the cost
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
of the well the cost of paying for the
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
the the monitor is
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
paid the the the the defendant has to
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
pay a weekly fee now in terms of the
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
cost of what does it cost straford
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
County for example to set up the program
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
that would be an interesting question I
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that but that that would
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
be an interesting question and it would
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
be interesting to hear from a place like
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
straford County on the effectiveness of
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
it do you only see it is it is it depend
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
on what county you're in who will be
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
using that and who doesn't yes it it is
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
dependent on what county you're in as we
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
love New Hampshire but it's very um very
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
different from County to County right um
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
if my my understanding is if you don't
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
have a county that has a I mean meramac
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
has a Community Corrections program I
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
know that straford does chesher does
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
there may be a few others but if you
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
don't have a Community Corrections
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
program then it's um I don't think you
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
can do the electronic monitoring and I
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
don't think you can really do elaborate
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
bail Supervision in other words in those
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
counties I think the judges and
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and defense attorneys are a
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
little more hamstrung in terms of the
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
options that they have okay so we need
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
to look into look into that and it's as
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know it can be it can be hard you
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
know when it's a county bycount thing uh
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
because you hear from the different
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
delegations and they've got their
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
different priorities I I honestly I mean
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
I I've have practiced a lot in straford
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think straford has been in many
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
ways for alternative sentencing has been
 
00:51:56.349 --> 00:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
held up as a model and I think for this
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
Community Corrections program there is a
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's probably the most cohesive and
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
chesher as well is probably a very good
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
place to look for a sort of model I
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
would like to see their um their bail
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
violations versus Hillsboro for example
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
the right the people who are part of
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
that um Community Corrections versus
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
people who are not and I would say I
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
mean in a place like Hillsboro I mean as
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
you know demographically it's it's it's
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
tougher place than you know Manchester
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
is a tough place there's no question so
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
Nash though so they yeah different uh
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um and I think I think that um you
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
know but I I I think if you had uh in
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester it would be interesting that
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
if you know that the Manchester
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
especially the circuit court has a
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
historical reputation for overly
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerating people um whether that's
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
born out statistically that's certainly
 
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
the anecdotal evidence um it would be
 
00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
interesting to know if they had some
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
other Alternatives in that county
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would consider not
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%

else I say now you can ignore they are
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
the big pieces but as I listened to the
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
conquered attorney uh Paul ly and I are
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
about to fly around the room there's a
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
couple things I want to say please first
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
you started this whole series Mr
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
chairman by saying we're going to get
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
this straightened out once and for
 
00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.510 align:start position:0%
this straightened out once and for
all

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
haha we have to try but that's a I don't
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
know that we're going to hit that goal
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take that as the part I can
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
ignore but go ahead the other thing is
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of vocabulary I heard
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
this and attorney has left but
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
felons go to state prison jail is pre-

Correction is post conviction just
 
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.870 align:start position:0%
Correction is post conviction just
terminology

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
terminology
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
look I've the 22 years 3600
 
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
baales I believe what the uh the bail
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner's handbook says about the
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
least restrictive I've never set a cash
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
bail on a bee you can't do that all du
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
DUI get out on PR it's just a fact of
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
life um I don't know where I'm not
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
denying him but I just I I've never done
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
that I've been I've been scolded by my
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
clerk I must be a defense uh bail
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner because I've been scolded
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
for letting them out too easy I would
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
have given a higher B what what are you
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
talking I have to do the least
 
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:24.039 align:start position:0%
restrictive that consist that the
 
00:55:24.039 --> 00:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
restrictive that consist that the
circumstances

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
allow uh about homeless long ago that's
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
settled you bail homeless that's the
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
other thing it's never happened but I
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
was told in one of our seminars which we
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
having October 18th Rocky amp County for
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners that even if he
 
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.549 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners that even if he
doesn't

00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
cooperate he's still entitled to bail
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
and I I write if you want me to not
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
answer I'll put refuse to answer you
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
tell I'm sure the judge will like that
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's as far as I go
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
but the worst I've gotten is you don't
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
want to give me a cell number something
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh I started off training in consistency
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's so big by the way I've told told
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
this story I bailed this just it just
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
the timing in because it land landed two
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
a week
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
ago aggravated sexual fonal assault a
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
natural father on his do 12-year-old
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
daughter he did
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
things I bailed him under PR no criminal
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
history no allegation he ever did
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
anything like this with her before it
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
was a visitation he has no contact with
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
her there was no indication that he he
 
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
was I don't know if contrite but subdued
 
00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:48.950 align:start position:0%
was I don't know if contrite but subdued
he

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
knew the if I jailed him and I know what
 
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
the news if this gets in New newspapers
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
if I jailed him it's punish Advanced
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
punishment it's not anything it did not
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
fit the circumstances of this situation
 
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.510 align:start position:0%
fit the circumstances of this situation
however

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
loathsome the Act was yeah as long as
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
the victim is protected then there's
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
really no there was no question about
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
any of that and or his stated
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
cooperation and there was no reason the
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
police didn't even want it okay so
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
please I'm going to leave every body
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
with training and consistency oh my God
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we want and just to um for
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the committee or myself um
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
my goal is to fix it once and for all so
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
haha but I set lofty goals and it's
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
better to set them high and not meet
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
them than set them low um also your
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
experiences as a bail commissioner um
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
our our our hearings have brought
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
forward and and shown us that are just
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
yours because because we were seeing
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
different experiences for every bail
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner so that brings us back to
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
training inconsistency um and with
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
regard to the list of um cases that the
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
the counselor brought what we don't have
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
is the back story I mean did the person
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
have an extensive record were there
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
other outstanding warrants they're so
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
complicated every case is complicated so
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
you have to take each individual before
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
you as they come and since the bail is
 
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:25.039 align:start position:0%
set thusly um but thank you for your
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
input as always did you want to add
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
though I'll just bring one of those nice
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
big Golden Delicious good morning my
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
name is Paul liry I am a bail
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I've been here before
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
you several times just to not pick on my
 
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
learned counsel but just to go along
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
with some of what he said it sounds you
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
know terrible but I think you hit the
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
nail on the head Paul Javy page two the
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
rest of the story if it was a DWI
 
00:58:58.839 --> 00:59:00.230 align:start position:0%
rest of the story if it was a DWI
misdemeanor

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
B if he had shown up in court he
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have had a cash bail
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
because he would have been released on
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
PR bail and the reason he comes before
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner is because DWI has
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
subsequence offenses as you commit them
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
and jail then becomes a possibility so
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
therefore that's why they're they're
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
bailed but typically almost all of them
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
other than they might be put in
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
protective custody because they don't
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
have anyone that wants to come pick them
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
up and they spend the night in the jail
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
and sleep it off and some of the other
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
things just listening to what he was
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
listing most of those typically it's not
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner bail commissioner
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
does just a little bit and when you see
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
2550 and $100 usually not a bail
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner that's usually a judge
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's wrestled with it looked at
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
homelessness and other things and is
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
looking at what is something that could
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
be a possible deterrent but not the
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
thing that's going to reasonably keep
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
them in jail cuz they set a $10 bail but
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
the guy didn't want to post it after
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
about nine months collection was taken
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
that person was bailed out but that was
 
01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:10.839 align:start position:0%
their choice but a lot of them is he
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
said are there because they don't have
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
the money homelessness doesn't come into
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
play however if they keep failing to
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
appear they end up with breach of bail
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
contemp of court and those take those be
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors of violations and bump them
 
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
up up to a misdemeanors which are
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
jailable offenses hence that's where the
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
problem comes the theft statute if you
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
know it's shoplifting and they take them
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
under the theft
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
statute when it's the third conviction
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
it bumps from B misdemeanor a
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor up to a felony level offense
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
and again creates another problem
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
especially if they don't go to court and
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's most of the challenges and many
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
times when I see him there it's because
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
they've already been before a judge
 
01:00:57.309 --> 01:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
we've got the bail orders from the judge
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
and it's just a matter of exchanging
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
money do the bail bond and he's on his
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
way it again it's not the bail
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners having the final say and
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
anything that happens to somebody on
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
Friday night or Friday afternoon
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon time it's the luck of the draw
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
because nobody works in the system the
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners are out there 128
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
hours a week on their own excluding
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
holidays then it goes up another eight
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
hours but the thing is it's Monday
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
through Friday 8 to 4 holidays excluded
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
so you know it just happens and it's
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's sad and as to what my bail
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner friend over there stated I
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
had one similar last
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
night no record no nothing but however
 
01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
uh when you take a baseball bat to a
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle somebody's face and somebody's
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
stomach and it's a first degree
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
assault and
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of stuff going on at
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
home that
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
says I'm not capable of making that
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
decision this person truly needs to be
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
seen by a judge because of the violent
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
nature of the
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
offense he'll be seeing the judge at
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
1:00 this afternoon but it's like it
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
just happens because sometimes it's the
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
nature of the offense that drives it as
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
well as what's going on and then when
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
you find the backstory of what's going
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
on in the house you can't return them to
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
that situation so again training I
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
support that 100% because I'm tired of
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
at 3 o'l in the morning trying to figure
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
out what in God's name we're supposed to
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
do because there is no Direction the
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner's manual lists crimes
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
that we cannot set bail on and homicide
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
or first second degree murder all those
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
things are listed in that and there's a
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
couple others and then there's some
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
caveats if they are out on probation of
 
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:54.910 align:start position:0%
caveats if they are out on probation of
parole

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
parole
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
and they do a certain amount of things
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
we can't bail them they need to see the
 
01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
judge and then probation and parole
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
probably would violate them so they bail
 
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner would not even be called
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
and that was in the 2016 Manual of 2020
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
which had been out there and supposedly
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
was going to be updated and they pulled
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
the 2020 down and it's not on the bail
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner's website anymore so I'm
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
still using my 2016 because I didn't
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
bother printing the 2020 because it was
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
online so but I mean that's the thing
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
when you hear stuff like that you've got
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind a lot of its electronic
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
bench warrants they have been seen by a
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
judge and unfortunately the time process
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
they don't find out they need an
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
attorney for someone at arraignment at
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock or one o'clock until first
 
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
thing Monday morning and they're trying
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
to jump through hoops to do it but they
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
also recognize they got a 5,000 to 6,000
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
case backlog because of Co on the court
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
appointed attorneys so that's part of of
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
their case load so there's a very small
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
pool available at the time too that's
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
another challenge um I I just have a
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
question before you go do you see any um
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
people that you bail have you seen any
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
of that are on electronic monitoring
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
when they're there uh yes I've seen some
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
of them but again that's nothing that
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
you know I've done that's something
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
court or pre-trial Services ordered and
 
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
I see it in marac County marac County
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
used to have a private company that was
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
doing it but recently they've taken it
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
in in house and they're now doing it
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
in-house where County employee or might
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
be with the pre-trial Services is
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
actually the one that comes up puts the
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
monitor on them sets it up and the
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
account and it's done there I don't know
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
where the monitoring is but that's at
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
merac County I can't speak to the others
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
okay and for the just for the purposes
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee who don't know you get
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
a a bench warrant that has conditions of
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
bail set you you're not allowed to alter
 
01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
bail set you you're not allowed to alter
that

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.029 align:start position:0%
that
correct

01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
for example if it says from the judge
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
anything signed by the
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
judge we do not touch we cannot change
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
save one item if he does if they do the
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
bail cash uh CTS cash to settle if they
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the money we have the ability
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
to change it to PR bail that is the only
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
bail that we can change cash to settle
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
means they owe a fine or what have you
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
say $500 usually like he said you know
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
he was speaking about debt is Court yeah
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
what happens is what they forget is they
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
sign a usually sign a contract that I'll
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
pay so much a week and at the very
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
bottom in fine print it says if it is
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
not paid in full by this date you will
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
appear before the judge on such and such
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
a date and time they don't show up hence
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
the electronic bench War for
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
nonappearance in
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
court and we go through the same thing
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
but it's for non-payment of fine yeah my
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
experience is a lot of people will sign
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
that because they want to get out of
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
jail they leave so well that's usually
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
at the court and but the thing is the
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
court has a one-page form if it's
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
strictly to pay fines or fees they can
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
wave arraignment and then if the court
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
wants to see them the court can then
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
reach out to them if they're able to pay
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
the money so you could change um cash to
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
settle that was $300 to
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
pr300 and give him a new give them a new
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
day um where they'd have to go explain
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't show up there' be
 
01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
other words I give them a new
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
arraignment date and then they go in
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
before the court and if they don't show
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
up for
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
that it may just be no bail or it could
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
be back to an electronic Benchmark and
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
see the thing is what happens is where
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
we all don't know it's whoever the
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
history of the individual yeah the court
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
may it be wh's end with this person
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
because they keep not showing up and
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
they keep pushing the bail up and it's
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
not having any action so they just go to
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
a no bail situation that guarantees when
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
they Court no questions us they're going
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
to be before the court yeah so I mean
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
that that's some of the challenges
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
because the thing is not a lot of us
 
01:06:59.309 --> 01:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
don't know Back stories yeah and I think
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's important we leave that discretion
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
to the judges on most of those cases
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much again
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
for adding to you're welcome we are
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to be in recess until 11:30 at
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
which time we'll decide if we're going
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
day wait minute I don't think I was
 
01:07:20.109 --> 01:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to say what he says there one
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
of those words we not supposed to say
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:42:37.149 align:start position:0%
what is
it

01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone um at this point
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
after confirm with the committee members
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
and um our witness list we're going to
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh call it a day tomorrow morning we
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
have someone coming the superintendent
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
from Rockingham is going to give us some
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
information on what they're doing um
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
what can be done and um we'll go from
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
there next week we have some um some
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
people that come in that run pre-trial
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
in various counties that will be able to
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
tell us you know what the gold standard
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
is and what they're doing and what maybe
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
it costs and what the potential is for
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
us to maybe implement it Statewide and
 
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
what the cost of that would be so I feel
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
like a lot of what we hear are these
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
small crimes and people not showing up
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
and this is something that I think that
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
a pre-trial system would be able to
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
manage and keep their eyes on people
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
whereas right now people are just in the
 
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
wind and then they end up with these
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
recurrent failures to show up and things
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
like that so that'll be for next week so
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're going to have the
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent from
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
Rockingham and I think there might be
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
someone else um I have to go back and
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
look at my list so that's it for today
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow
