Hampshire was up more than 50% in the
 
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
last year there are many factors leading
 
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
to this issue ranging from housing
 
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 align:start position:0%
shortages lack of programs and income
 
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 align:start position:0%

experiencing homelessness there's been a
 
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
lot of bipartisan work done on this in
 
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 align:start position:0%

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%

members representative Edwards uh thank
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair it's not a question as much
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
as it is um
 
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh a notice um division 3 has a work
 
00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
session on this bill at 2:30 and I
 
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
expect that we're going to go into depth
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
about um about this bill and what we're
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
looking for as a heads up I I I would
 
00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate at 2:30 to um have sort of a
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
a a lay down or a perspective on where
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
we think the money is going to go
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
geographically within the state I know
 
00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
we have big needs in Manchester I know
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
we have needs around the state and other
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
shelters I just would like to see where
 
00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 align:start position:0%
those are uh representative thank you
 
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
for that I will get that to you uh this
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon you don't have it before thank
 
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
you Senator appreciate it represent
 
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative papichi Mueller for a
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
you senator for presenting the bill I
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
had two very quick questions and if you
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the answers right now if
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
maybe they could be made available you
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
know uh first the uh 2.5 million that we
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh how much of a percentage
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
increase is that to the current amounts
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
that we are paying for shelter Services
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely so uh I'm assuming you all
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
have the handout y yeah so at the bottom
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
of it you can see that this will create
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
this will raise the rates from $20 per
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
bed to $27 per bed but in reality uh
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
true costs for shelter beds are $45 to
 
00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
$75 per bed so we're barely even
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
scratching the surface with this money
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and um the last paragraph that
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
you were mentioning in your presentation
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
that uh the recip of this funding will
 
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
have to have projections and so on is
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
that addressing an existing problem
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
where you know the state is giving funds
 
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
to shelters and shelters get you know
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
shut down and keep the funding what was
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
the imper for that I mean I understand
 
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
it as a general precaution but I was
 
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
curious whether there were specific
 
00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
incidents or cases that made the you
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
know Senate feel that that was uh
 
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
necessary because it seems to create a
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
burden on the shelters and obviously you
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
can justify that but yeah I mean thank
 
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
you for the question I don't think we
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
want to create a burden any more so on
 
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
shelters but we do want to see how the
 
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
money is being utilized and how it's
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
tracking and how we're helping these uh
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
shelters I think um you know good
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
governance uh we see what we're getting
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
on return to our investment thank
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray for a question
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh following up on
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
that I was asking about your the the ex
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh projections for the expectations um
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
for the the facilities is there a sense
 
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
of that around sustainability or are you
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
looking to see what um growth or
 
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
diminishment of people who are using
 
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
these Services um I guess just a little
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
bit more information about what you what
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
would you would see in those in that
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
request thank you for the question
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see any growth
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
because this money does not create new
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
beds um we have an issue where we had a
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
lot of federal money uh for these
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
shelter programs and that money has gone
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
now and these shelters have been running
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
at that capacity and they're all full I
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a single open bed
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
right now and all the shelters are full
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
and they've been running with all that
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
money that we've had from the federal
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
government but that's gone now and we
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
need to keep them sustained this is a
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
this is a Band-Aid for a bullet wound uh
 
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
this is not a long-term fix by any means
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
and the original bill um was much more
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive but after working you know
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
with my Senate colleagues in a
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan manner we kind of boiled it
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
down to this and the plan is uh you know
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back to the table
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
next year with a much more comprehensive
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill but uh this is a this is a plug in
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
this leaky ship and and they desperately
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
need this
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
money follow up thank you oh and nice to
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
see you here um I was also asking will
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
there be a growth in the population uh
 
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
growth in the population of the homeless
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
the people who will be needing these
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
Services I I think we are experiencing
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
growth in homelessness across the state
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
no matter if this money comes or if it
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't um you know we need to address
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
the homeless issue we're having in New
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh this bill doesn't
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily do that this bill helps the
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
existing shelters that we already have
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
and most of these shelter beds like I
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
said are completely full or you know
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
they might have one bed open um but the
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
shelters desperately need this money and
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
members I now have eight more cards
 
00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from more people
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
so it's at uh e extra $7 a day that's uh
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
just running the math that's roughly a
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
th000 beds is that the state capacity
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
right now and the follow-up question to
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
that would be um uh is your concern if
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
we don't do this that the number of beds
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
we'd have available might go down
 
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
because you're you've already expressed
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
that it this is not going to increase
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
the number of beds and all the money
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
that we're appropriating is for existing
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
capacity to help Shore that up thank you
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
I can't give you the state capacity I
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
think somewhere behind me most certainly
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
can but I will say
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
no this money is not creating bets I
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear with that um but
 
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
if we don't give this money you may see
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
shelters dial back their services which
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
will lose bets um you know these
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
shelters are are desperate for funds um
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the last thing we want to do is lose
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
capacity further
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative cambrell thank
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking the
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
question uh it says here in the bill
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
that you shall not knowingly provide
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
services to any person not legally
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
present in the United States so what
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
proactive measures are taken in order to
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
determine if a person is legal or not
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
you know I would um thank you for the
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
question I would certainly ask the
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
shelters that question um what I
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
understand is and and I've actually
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
volunteered in shelters before I've done
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
a 7 PM shift to a 7 AM shift uh you know
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
these are people in your community these
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
are you know local members that you see
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
often every day um
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
and homelessness can can really affect
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
anyone um you know it's a economics um
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
down on their luck people so when it
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
comes to you know legal residents the
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
shelters um have a process in place to
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
verify who's coming into their shelter
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
and I and I would certainly follow up
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%

get $2,200,000 from the state so that
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
means we have to fundraise $300,000 to
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
service the population that we serve uh
 
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360 align:start position:0%

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%

backgrounds that are are present on our
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
door and we're mandated by state
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
contract to serve them um until they do
 
00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:47.959 align:start position:0%
something at the shelter I had the
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
police at my shelter this weekend uh
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
because somebody at the shelter
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
threatened to spray them with pepper
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
spray and they had pepper spray on them
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have the staff to search people
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%

check um to answer your question about
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
first and foremost job if they don't
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
have identification is to help them get
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
identification um our services are
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency any questions from
 
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.230 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency any questions from
committee

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
members excuse me representative
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
tki thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
being here today while the bill is
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
pretty bare bones in terms of it's just
 
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
an additional 2.5 million and you would
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
not be able to determine how much your
 
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
organization would be able to benefit
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
from increased funding let's just say
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
what would be your priority if you were
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
to receive an additional $25,000 or
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
whatever the amount what would be your
 
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
top priority increasing staff wages I'm
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
like I said I'm literally competing with
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
17 to $20 an hour from Burger King and
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts are all
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
playing 17 to start in my area
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
follow up quickly follow up and what do
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
you pay now 17 if they're not alone and
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
20 if they are thank
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Hull for a question
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
thank you how many beds I have 28 beds
 
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.189 align:start position:0%
thank you how many beds I have 28 beds
thank

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
you further questions from committee
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
members representative Edwards uh thank
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um in your experience I I I
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
I I think uh the housing First Federal
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
policy hasn't been in place something
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
like 20 years and from my understanding
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
viewing it through the Liberty house uh
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
Spectrum um the housing first policy
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
creates a tremendous challenge for our
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
homeless shelters because we can't
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate the bad apples that continue
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
to abuse substances and therefore we
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
continually repute the population that's
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the homeless shelters exacerbating
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
and continuing the problem is is that
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
your experience could you speak to um
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
the the housing first policy and and
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
whether so that we know that as a state
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
whether we want to petition our federal
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
delegation to change that
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
policy I'm gonna be really Politically
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
Incorrect here I'm very sorry welcome to
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
the club
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
y um I understand that housing first in
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
theory works I've heard it work in other
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
states great I personally don't see how
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
it's working I'm working with landlords
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
that do credit checks I have a family
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
right now that makes
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
$8,000 a year and can't find an
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
apartment because his credit isn't well
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
enough because he's never had alone so
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have them in our transitional housing
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
not taking beds and shelters but this is
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
a family of four she's on Social
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
Security he works as a cook at the orous

executive director of Crossroads house I

am here to support this bill um for the
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
reasons that have already been stated um
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
just uh to preface uh we are the second
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
largest homeless shelter in the state
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're a low barrier shelter we serve
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
Rockingham stford County um we also have
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
a a u the only warming shelter for
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
winter warming shelter um that serves
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
all of Rockingham County last uh year we
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
served 461 individuals so we serve men
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
women and families we can house up to 12
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
families and um uh the average day for
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
us is about 62 days um we are very ex
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
intensive on case management and we're
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
very successful because of that I mean
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
we uh you talk about uh housing first
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
and I will say that um one of the things
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
that uh makes us successful in terms of
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
working with landlords is that we
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
provide that case management landlords
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
are very difficult to work with if we
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't provide the the assurance that uh
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
we will work with them if any issues
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
come up over over
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
time um so you know we're very
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the fact that the that
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
the state increased funding for us to
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
$20 per bed from $8 per bed uh last year
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh this increase to
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
$27 is not going to solve the problem as
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Fenton said but it will um help
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
us through this period of growth so we
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
we are projecting that we will be over
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
500 individuals this year um and
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
continue to grow and the reason for that
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
is because we are seeing more homeless
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
um and and the homeless population is so
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
diverse now it's not what we all uh have
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
thought about in the past um the biggest
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
growth in homelessness as some of you
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
may be aware is in the elderly
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
population people who are on fixed
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
incomes um and can no longer afford to
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
stay in their places as well as families
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
and women so for example when we built
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
our facility back in 2008 2009 we built
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
it because we had more men at the time
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so we can house double the number of
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
men than we do women it has turned out
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
that uh today um we have many more women
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
that are being that are becoming
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
homeless and therefore there's a this is
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
an inequity that we have to to address
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
in our facility but that's one of the
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
issues that we have to address so we're
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
seeing more women more families and more
 
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
elderly the elderly of course um uh come
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
with underlying health issues with which
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
shelters are not prepared to to deal
 
00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
with so we have to work very closely
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
with our local hospitals to address
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
those issues but uh the the the so we
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
would if we get this money then we would
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
use this money to um to uh support our
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
staff I mean our staff uh we start them
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
at 1750
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh case managers are $20 plus um but
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's again we're competing with with
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the the marketplace and in order for
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
us to attract and retain qualified
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
individuals to do this very stressful
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
work we have to be able to pay more and
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're really not there yet um so I
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
will stop there and take any questions
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you for your
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
testimony wow thank
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
you well next call on step Tower from
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
assistance good morning Mr chairman
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I am Steve
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
Tower from New Hampshire legal
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
assistants I am the managing attorney at
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
our office in Manchester I'm also the
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
director of our local welfare project um
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
which deals with legal issues involving
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
the local statute um which as you know
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
is a a program where municipalities
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
provide uh basic minimal support to
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
people who are poor and unable to
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
support themselves and a lot of that
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
involves referrals to shelters for
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
people who are homeless um I've been
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
working doing local welfare work for
 
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.190 align:start position:0%
working doing local welfare work for
nhla

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
nhla
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
for almost 10 years now and
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
the demands that towns are facing and
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
the demands that shelters are facing
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
have substantially
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
increased very noticeably have increased
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
over that time um so I again I recognize
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill is a Band-Aid to prevent
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
our our shelter system from getting
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
worse uh but I would urge the committee
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill and to in the future
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
consider more steps to try to address
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the homelessness crisis which is
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
the other half of the general housing
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
crisis that we're seeing in the state um
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
not to take up too much more of your
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
time but I did want to mention one fact
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
that even as a homeless
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
Advocate I recently learned and was
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
shocking to me uh I was talking to a
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
welfare director from one of the larger
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities who mentioned that um in
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
addition to the difficulties of of
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
finding shelter beds available
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
um in the past there had been the
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
availability of referring uh single
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
individuals to um um what are they
 
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.070 align:start position:0%
individuals to um um what are they
called

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm drawing a blank on the name it's
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
a the a facility that's a rooming house
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
a rooming house uh and that in the past
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
rooming houses were seen as fairly
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
undesirable and sort of a Housing
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
Opportunity of Last Resort for people
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
who couldn't get into a more traditional
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
apartment um but this local welfare
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
director has told me that in
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
conversations with people who run
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
roaming houses they have been told
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
that the the folks who are now applying
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
for that single room in a rooming house
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
are people who are making $3,000 a month
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes $5,000 a month and that is the
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
housing that they are able to find and
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they don't want to be there but
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the housing of Last
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
Resort and I I hear that and I look at
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
my clients who are homeless and they're
 
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.870 align:start position:0%
my clients who are homeless and they're
living

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
living
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
on8 or $900 a month of Social
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
Security and I I just don't know what to
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
do with them the housing options are not
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
out there the shelter options are not
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
out there it's it's
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh it's scary and I just think it's
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
going to continue to get worse in the
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
near future so thank you for considering
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and I I I hope that going
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
forward uh you can continue to address
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
this issue thank you questions from
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
Committee Member representative Edwards
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
oh so we've heard thank you for taking
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
my question and U I'm I'm I'm looking
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for your
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh local leadership perspective on the
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
answer to this and that is you've said
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
that we've got a Band-Aid situation this
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
isn't going to solve the problem you've
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
cited some specific issues where people
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
with resources are still struggling to
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
find housing do you do you where do you
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
think a permanent good
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
sustainable position is going to come
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
from what what might that look like what
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
throwing money at a ongoing problem
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
without addressing the underlying
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
problem is is is probably not good
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
policy do you have a a vision for us to
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
consider um and it's it's not exactly my
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse of of local of low-income
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
legal issues but uh as somebody who who
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
deals with the issue I think we just
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
need to build a lot more housing like 10
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
to 20 times more than what we're
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
currently building which is more than
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
what we've been building in the past um
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
we need to build housing at at at all
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
affordability levels um we need
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
low-income housing we need you know any
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
kind of housing you can build in
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester I would like to see 10 to 15
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
story apartment buildings going up
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
everywhere I think that's really the
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
only way we're going to fix this and uh
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's I'm sure maybe not an encouraging
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
thought but I it's
 
00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:46.950 align:start position:0%
thought but I it's
just

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
the the change that I have seen in the
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
demands of the homeless population and
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
the size of the homeless population
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
since say 2016 2017 to now
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
is very substantial and um it is a lot
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
of people who are not your sort of
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
stereotypical people who can't hold a
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
job people who who have drug issues I
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot of seniors who can't afford
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the apartment that they've been living
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
in for the last 18 years or um families
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
who often again seniors who maybe their
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
their 50-year-old daughter or son moved
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
in with them and caused problems for
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
them and they faced an eviction and now
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
they can't find an apartment um because
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
the housing market is so tight that if
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
you have an eviction on your record no
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
landlord is going to take you because
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have to they can be very
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
selective in this market right now um if
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
you have bad credit you have credit less
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
than 650 or 700 a landlord doesn't have
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
to accept you because they've got a
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
stack of 50 other applicants for that
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
same apartment the first week they
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%

of Senate Bill

406 um I would like to start by
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this uh is an off
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
budget year in the legislature and thank
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
this committee for considering the
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
emergency funding that as we've heard is
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
so desperately needed I'd also like to
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for your role in
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
moving a great deal of pandemic relief
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
funding towards housing stabilization at
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire we
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
recognize the tremendous work that that
 
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.789 align:start position:0%
recognize the tremendous work that that
entails

00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
entails
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
um by legislators and practitioners uh
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
we did come out of the pandemic
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with an increase in the
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
number of people experiencing
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness and housing instability
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
however without the work you all put
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
into this uh we would be in a much worse
 
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
position the last budget passed by the
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
legislature included a $10 million
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
increase to shelter contracts uh but as
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard earlier uh from Senator
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
Fenton the per night cost of a shelter
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
bed is about $47 in the State uh prior
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
to this budget the state was reimbursing
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
at about $8 of that cost last year's
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
budget brought that number up to 20 but
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
as you can see there is still a
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
significant Gap and we've heard that um
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
from a few folks this morning
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this increase in the
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement also came at a time where
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
we're seeing an increase in need a steep
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
demand for services and some of our most
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
critical shelters uh that will
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
serve uh so many people are at risk of
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
closing if we don't uh Grant this
 
00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:03.630 align:start position:0%
closing if we don't uh Grant this
special

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation um I serve as the Director
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
of Home forall Coalition and on the
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
governing Council of housing action New
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and in my role with home
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
forall working with many shelter
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
providers I've observed for quite some
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
time that the demand for shelter is far
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
greater than um what shelters are able
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
to provide on the Sea Coast the shelters
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
are routinely at or over capacity um
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
which has continued to uh Prevail uh so
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
long as the housing prices stay where
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
they are and any units that are
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
available are so far Out Of Reach for
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
some of our most vulnerable uh residents
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire when there's not
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
adequate uh shelter beds available um
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
folks are living in unsafe substandard
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh housing situations uh they might be
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
couch surfing putting other households
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
at risk of losing their housing um and
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
we see a continued increase in calls for
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
shelter and in a previous role I was on
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
the other end of the phone taking many
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
of those calls for shelter and this was
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
pre pandemic but there is no worse
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
feeling than taking a call from somebody
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the night who had their
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
one window of opportunity to flee abuse
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
with their children and have to tell
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
them I'm really sorry the best thing we
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
can do right now is safety plan um and
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
and sleep in the parking lot of a
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
hospital uh because there are no shelter
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
beds available for you or your children
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
um and and that's something that I think
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to see and I
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine what those calls sound
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
like um if we're losing shelter beds um
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
and I I also want to just mention that
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
shelters are often the first uh line of
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
defense for picking up where many other
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
systems have failed whether it is
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
affordable housing uh Health Care uh
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
criminal justice or more um they really
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
play an important role um in our
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
communities and I continuously hear that
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
there is a need for better access to
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
Services particularly to prevent
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
homelessness but also for those exiting
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
um a period of homelessness I've seen in
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
my current role firsthand how
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
transformational shelter can be it's so
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
much more than just providing a bed um
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
we've seen that with those Supportive
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
Services and the right Staffing in those
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
case management roles somebody can um
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
really succeed and become thriving
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
members of our community and thus
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
prevent returns to homelessness but
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
without that support it's it can very
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
easily become a revolving door for those
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
who are lucky to get the opportunity to
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
get a bed um which there certainly is
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
not enough uh we saw the substantial
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
Investments uh made as part of a
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic that did help our communities
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
and keep families from experiencing
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
homelessness but also provided really
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
critical resources for those that
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately were unhoused at the time
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
and in the midst of this housing crisis
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
our Shelter Systems are extremely
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and without increased
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
support of any kind our providers can't
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
handle the demand um I also lastly would
 
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
like to uh close off um that we
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
recognize that the Department of Health
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
and Human Services did ask for $24
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
million for shelter contracts for the
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
2425 fiscal year and they received 10
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
million so again um we truly appreciate
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
your consideration uh for adding another
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
2.5 to help uh sustain Services until
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle thank you thank
 
00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:29.430 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle thank you thank
you

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
members who did you just
 
00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.870 align:start position:0%
members who did you just
see

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
oh representative Edwards for a question
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
you appoint to somebody else yeah no no
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
that was me um thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
um you you're you're you're using some
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
numbers that we I don't think we've
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
heard here yet this morning where you
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
you said we were at $8 a day uh now
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're at $20 a day I I was talking to
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
the um the mayor of Manchester last
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
night and he thinks that if this bill
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
passes it'll be $24 a day uh or in that
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhood assuming that's a correct
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
number uh and your costs are $47 a day
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
and this will still only be $24 a day
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
are we still um on the brink of failure
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
of our our Homeless Shelter Systems and
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
and what what would that are you you
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
able to survive on $24 a day is part one
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the question and two um what what
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
does failure of the shelter system look
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
like sure um so I am not a shelter
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
provider so I'm not sure that I can
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
speak to that entirely but I can say
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
without um that support they're not
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
going to have the Staffing or they're
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
going to be able to provide minimal
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
support meaning they're only able to
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
triage what's right in front of them
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
which is the people in their shelter
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's not addressing their ability to
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
help them with the skills that they need
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
to to not return so so that's great I'll
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
I'll wait in case there's somebody who
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer the question more
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
completely than you're in a position to
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
represent PHS thank you Mr chair and
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I'm just
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
wondering could you speak to a little
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
bit more about your population how many
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
people you're serving um so uh the home
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
for-all Coalition uh is not a shelter
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
provider but we work with shelter
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
providers throughout the Sea Coast um so
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
many of the folks here um that are in
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
this room we've worked with in some
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
capacity um our Coalition has um seen
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
amongst our shelter providers but also
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh not your typical service providers so
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
we hear from our food pantries that
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
while their job is to provide food to
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
those who are food insecure they're also
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
faced with helping those that come into
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
their pantries the ability to to find
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
housing and so we're seeing it across
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
multiple providers that there is an
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
increase um I can't speak to those
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
numbers per se um our Coalition uh did
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
work with many of these providers in
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
2020 to uh pilot a program called the
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing incentive program and
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
I know since 2020 we've been able to
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
move just on the C Coast over 200
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
individuals from shelters um from unsafe
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
housing situation ation into permanent
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
housing with about a
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
92% success rate and that success is
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
directly uh a result of the shelter
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
providers we worked with who had the
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
staff and capacity to continue to follow
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
these individuals after they were in
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
shelter into permanent housing so that
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
successful muray for a question thank
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for being
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
here um this is a little maybe to the
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
side but um for my benefit maybe for a
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
few other others can you provide some
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
historical perspective in terms of where
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
we are now because it seems to me in my
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
memory churches used to help out with
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
shelter churches used to help out with
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
what they still do with food pantries
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
but they used to be a resource and
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
somehow that doesn't seem to be that
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
that they resource anymore do you have
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
any can you speak to that trans
 
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
transition to where we lost that help
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm no way suggesting we should go
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
back to that I'm just curious to
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
understand the progression a little bit
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
sure I think churches are helping in the
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
ways that they're able to um now I don't
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
know that all churches are uh well
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
positioned to provide shelter uh those
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
that are able to I imagine still are
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
doing so um but we also are seeing
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
churches step up in a way that they
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
haven't before in um giving their land
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
to the community to Steward for
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing to play their role in
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
addressing the housing crisis um but
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
churches by themselves won't be able to
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you for your
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
testimony we next call on Ben Bradley
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
Association good morning Mr chairman for
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Ben Bradley I'm
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
the vice president of state government
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
relations for the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
Association we represent all 26 of new
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's acute care hospitals and
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
all specialty hospitals um we strongly
 
00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
support s SP 406 and the $2.5 million
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's provides to shelter
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
programs um you've heard from folks in
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
the shelter Community about their
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
concerns I want to provide a little
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
different perspective on why we support
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
this bill as well um beyond the direct
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
benefit to the homeless sp sp 406 would
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
help support our efforts to reduce
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
barriers to hospital discharge across
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
new hampsh
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
patients who across New Hampshire
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
patients who no longer need care in a
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
hospital are stuck in hospital beds
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
awaiting safe discharge for various
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
reasons one of the barriers identified
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
in a recent March 2024 foundation for
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
healthy Community summary report is
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
homelessness and housing insecurity in
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
order to move a patient out of the
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
hospital setting our members are
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
required to ensure the patient is
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
leaving for a safe environment this bill
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
would help support the uh access to
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
shelters where patients could be safely
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
discharged if they're homeless I
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
understand it doesn't increase the beds
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
but it would be deeply concerned giving
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
the existing scenario we face if they
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
were reduced in any capacity discharge
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
delays impact not only patients awaiting
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
that discharge but also those needing
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
impatient beds waiting in emergency
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
departments on any given day dozens of
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
patients in New Hampshire are waiting in
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
an emergency department to be admitted
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
for hospital care but cannot be admitted
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
because an inpatient bed is not
 
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
available getting homeless patients out
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
of the hospital and into an appropriate
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
setting frees up additional capacity for
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
patients truly in need of hospital care
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
s SP 406 would greatly benefit Granite
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
Staters in multiple ways and I urge the
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee to support the bill happy to
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
take your questions thank you questions
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
from committee members represent Edwards
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank thank you Mr Bradley
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
for taking the question right I want to
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
understand the uh underlying logic
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
behind the statement that 406 will make
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
a difference in the discharge rates from
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals it's it's my understanding
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to move from $20 a day to
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
$24 a day that we're already at Max
 
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
Capacity in all of our shelters so I
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't see us this 406 moving the the
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
needle very much if at all really other
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
than to keep some of these uh shelters
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
from going out of business MH so how is
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
it you see from the hospital Association
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
perspective that this bill will actually
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
help your discharge issue well I think
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm the point I'm trying to make is
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
the latter point of your statement which
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
is sustaining shelter programs
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
beds further questions from committee
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
members represent thank you Mr chair I
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
don't know whether this is uh something
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
we want to get into in detail in a
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
hearing but I I'm not sure where the
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
obviously the the obligation to only
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
discharge patients if they have a safe
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
environment it seems to basically Force
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals to retain patients that no
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
longer have a medical need to be in the
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
hospital but you're unable to discharge
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
them what is the you know who created
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
that obligation and again let's keep it
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
short because uh sure I'll I'll I'm
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up with you but I'll
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
stick to um existing statute that puts
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
an obligation on the hospitals to uh
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
serve the community and ensure that when
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
they are discharged it's in a safe
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
environment federal or state statutes um
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
I would say both thank you sure
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for taking my question
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
and thanks for your testimony um uh you
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
know the legisl made quite an investment
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh in increasing uh certain Medicaid
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
rates particularly nursing homes and at
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
home systems to provide hopefully more
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
access for people who are are uh ready
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
for discharge from hospitals but have
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go I realize it's early in
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
this bium but have you seen any movement
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
at all uh in increased uh access for
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
people uh who were stuck at the hospital
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
are we about the same place we were say
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
a year ago sure thanks representative um
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh like you said I think it's early um
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of uh our hope that
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
those increase rates would help support
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
those facilities that we could
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately discharge to um I'm not
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to how effective that
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
point representa haen Phillips for a
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Bradley um I'm
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could just kind of give
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
us a
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
quantitative picture you know could you
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
let us know
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
how large this um undischarged um
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
population with no place to go that's
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
safe um you know how large that is for
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
the state certainly so the hospitals
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
have done a uh recent they did a report
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
in September we did a report in
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
September and we have a recent update
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's come out um from the total
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh amount capacity that
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
are waiting in a hospital bed that could
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
be discharged uh for very ious reasons
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
on any given day it's over 100
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
patients um and for homelessness housing
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
and security I would say uh upwards of a
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%

up how do we address it well it's a
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
multi-prong approach that's going to be
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
needed and the shelters two of which you
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
heard from this morning um non-profits
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
community action programs and
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities are all critical
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the work to address
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
homelessness so s SP 406 has had a
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
couple of iterations and right now the
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
bill as amended and as it appears before
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
you would provide the funding um to
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
those homeless shelters and would
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
increase their uh rate from $20 a day to
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
$27 a day um and we again I think it's
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
been um mentioned we really appreciate
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
the legislature's support um in the last
 
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
budget process we're getting closer to
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
the uh cost which is about
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
$47 a day and that's that's from a
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
couple years ago so we know that those
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh costs have uh increase and this bill
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
will help um close that Gap and so
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm here to speak in support
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill one of the things that's really
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
important to know is that these aren't
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
the only funds that the homeless
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
shelters uh have they do a ton of grant
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
writing and fundraising so their budgets
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
um we you know we have the allocations
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
to them and I have that information if
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
needed for this afternoon for the work
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
session um about how much each of the 13
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
agencies Statewide uh receive in funding
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
so they're cobbling funds together um um
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
on a regular
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
basis and
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
um let me see what else I may have
 
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.510 align:start position:0%
um let me see what else I may have
missed

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
missed
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
um again we have 13 agencies that we
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
fund uh through the department and that
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
is Statewide coverage there are a total
 
00:46:19.559 --> 00:46:20.470 align:start position:0%
is Statewide coverage there are a total
of

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
950 shelter beds in the state that we
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
fund and um I can pick up some of the
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
other questions that were asked probably
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
um best left for the work session this
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon but I'd be happy to take any
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the director
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative shurki thank you thank
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman very quickly um how many
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
with 950 beds in the state how many
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
would we need to accommodate where we're
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
at I I don't have the answer to that
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
question um I might be able to come back
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
with it this afternoon but um I I don't
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
know okay thank
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
you f the questions from committee can
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
can you attribute anything to this
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
increase um I think that the
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
representative from legal assistance um
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
had um a a good response I think that we
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
have seen the erosion of permanent
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
housing so a lot of the efforts rightly
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
so have been for the um the absolute
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario which someone is
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
homeless and so we have homeless
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
shelters we have transitional housing um
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are stepping down from
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
another level of care who are going into
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
transitional housing we don't have
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
enough of the supportive permanent
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
housing um available to help individuals
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
thrive in their communities and be able
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
to maintain uh stature in the in the
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
community so I think it it comes down to
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
a affordable housing and that's all the
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
way you know up and down the spectrum of
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
independent um housing single family
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
homes Etc thank
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
you represent grassy for a question to
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
follow up on the Chairman's question
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
would you believe that a uh resident a
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine called me last week
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
with a 83-year-old woman who was in his
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
church who makes about $900 a week a
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
month in Social Security had rented 50 a
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
month the landlord went up to $1,800 a
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
month on her rent and she was basically
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
asked to leave her apartment and she's
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
now sleeping on the couch of this
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
gentleman's house because they cannot
 
00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:41.319 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire I am here with Erica
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
Diamond who is our director of Grant
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
compliance for the
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
organization um many of you probably
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
know about families in transition where
 
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.549 align:start position:0%
know about families in transition where
a

00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
501c3 um we have an array of services
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
that go from um emergency homeless
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
Sheltering to actually permanent housing
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
um the work that we do uh includes the
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
largest adult shelter in the state of
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at 138 beds for men and
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
women we also serve 11 families every
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
single night 46 beds at our family
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
shelter uh right now we have 84 adults
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
and 114 children which makes up 62
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
families from across the state on our
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
wait list for family
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
Sheltering almost every single night at
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
our adult shelter we turn away men and
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
women in the city of Manchester and mind
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
you the city of Manchester also has its
 
00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
own shelter that serves about 40 people
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
every single night so right there we can
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
add up very quickly for adult men and
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
women um the need in Manchester is
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
pretty great but again we serve people
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
from across the
 
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
state based on our um budget for us to
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
run our Emergency Shelters every single
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
night is $45 per bed per day every
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
single shelter is a little bit different
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
if you have to rent a place we own our
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
building it's an old and horrible
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
building but it does serve the people
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
that we need to serve um but that $45
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
per bed per day does not include our
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
indirect costs so this past year I had
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
to put in a new HVAC system I had to put
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
in a new roof two years ago um so those
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
costs are not in that $45 per bed per
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
day that is the basic cost to run the
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
program to provide the services the
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
three meals a day etc for our
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
clients right now we have about a 1.5
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
million do gap between the services that
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
we provide and the funding from the
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
state so that $1.5 million gap comes
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
from our philanthropic efforts so you've
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
heard the shelters before me um and a
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
few others who have said that we're
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
depending on the New Hampshire community
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
members and businesses to help fund that
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
Gap and what happens if we can't fund
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
that Gap this year this is a decision
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
that families in transition is taking
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
very serious iously right now through
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
the years of covid we had quite a bit of
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
money to help support our services we
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
even grew our services over the time
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
that covid had happened when we took
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
over the adult shelter in 2018 it served
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
70 people we're now at
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
138 so we grew by almost twice the size
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
which of course increased the cost as
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
well but right now we're at a point
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
where if we cannot get more funding that
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
$1.5 million deficit is
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
unsustainable so we are looking at
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
decreasing our services and that could
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
take two different paths One path could
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
be that from Spring till October we
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
actually close down during the day this
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
is not something we do right now we're a
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
24hour operating shelter so during the
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
day our folks are not asked to leave
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
they can stay in the building they have
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
lunch they go to programming they meet
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
with their case manager and we also have
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
resource Fair
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the month where Community
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
Partners DMV welfare everyone comes into
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
our building to serve the
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
population if we're unable to do that
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
during the day we would be then sending
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
138 men and women into basically
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
downtown Manchester to find something to
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
do for the entire
 
00:53:21.309 --> 00:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
day the other thing we could do um is
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
actually reduce our numbers our nightly
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
number um that would then reduce our
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
head count it would reduce the food
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
count um we would look at going from 138
 
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
men and women to um 70 back down to its
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
original size this is uh an issue that
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
has to do a little bit with the building
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we have um and it's because it's on
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
three different floors if we've closed
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
off some of the floors we then can have
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
Staffing in a much smaller place um we
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
run on a staffing model for us it's
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
extremely important to have the right
 
00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
Staffing on for 1338 men and women so we
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
have three different floors we have to
 
00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
staff each of those floors the reason
 
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
why it's important to have a appropriate
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing is number one it is a safety
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
issue number two we're actually looking
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
after people who um because we are also
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
a low barrier Shel shelter if they have
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
used during the day often times we are
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
providing Naran and calling 911 so we're
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
not having um overdose deaths at our
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
location last night for example um this
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
morning we actually had an OD um we were
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
able to provide Nar can but that's only
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
because our third shift staff stay awake
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
all night long and basically look at
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
everyone and make sure that they're
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
breathing every single night so the
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
funding is not a huge increase there's
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
still going to be a gap but for us it's
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
a way for us to shrink our current
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
deficit and that's really the most
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
important thing for us we do very well
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
um by raising about $2.7 million
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
philanthropically for our organization
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
which is actually quite a bit of money
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
um but this would help shrink the
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
deficit um and really help us put us in
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
a in a stable place for the time that
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's here we're going to be visiting
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
again next year I know it's going to be
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
tough another tough year but as people
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
said until there's more housing there's
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
no place for people to go we have people
 
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
who are in our shelter families and
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
adults who have um been issued a voucher
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
but there's no place for them to use
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
that voucher and after a year that
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
voucher becomes null and void so it is
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
an extremely difficult place that we're
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
in here in the state of New Hampshire we
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
also provide housing unfortunately we're
 
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
not in a place to build more housing
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
because it is too
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
expensive it would take a couple of
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
years to build the appropriate housing
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
but we have 20 other buildings that we
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
use for housing which are also not
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
running in a positive and so taking on
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
another permanent Supportive Housing
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
project is is something that's really
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
tricky for us but something we're
 
00:55:58.109 --> 00:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
committed to we just have to figure out
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
how to do it happy to answer any
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
questions M Diamond do you have anything
 
00:56:03.799 --> 00:56:06.870 align:start position:0%
questions M Diamond do you have anything
to

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
add no no thank
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
you represent Edwards for a
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
question um thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
you uh for all the work you do I I um
 
00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:23.039 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if if if you know whether or
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
not Asylum Seekers that have that are
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
recently arrived in country if they're
 
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
eligible for your shelter services and
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
if you're seeing any increase in that
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
particular uh subset of the population
 
00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.470 align:start position:0%
particular uh subset of the population
seeking

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
housing so we are seeing some folks who
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
um are illegal immigrants coming into
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
our shelter uh finding housing is
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult for somebody who um
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
is here and doesn't have the proper
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
identification in fact it's impossible
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
it is a challenge for us to figure out
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
we need to work with the Department of
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and other
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
community services in order to help
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
serve this group um we have had about 14
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
individuals at our adult shelter
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the course of the year who um
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
do not have any
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
identification it's not something that
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
we would say is anywhere close to what
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
is happening down in Massachusetts um
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a concern of that but
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
we're a low barrier shelter and as far
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
as I know our contract is that we serve
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
anyone who comes to us who is seeking um
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
support the bill says prioritize needs
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
of veterans do you do that yes we do in
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
fact um there's two prior groups um
 
00:57:45.789 --> 00:57:45.799 align:start position:0%
prioritized groups that we work with
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
veterans is one due to the fact that
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
there's lots of other services out there
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
that can serve veterans and actually get
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
them housed very quickly so as soon as
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
we know that we have a veteran and at
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
our location um we hook them up with the
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
services if they're agreeable to it so
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
that they can be housed much more
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
quickly than um many others the other
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
group we prioritize in our adult shelter
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
is um uh young adults so um men and
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
women between the ages of 18 and
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
24 the adult shelter is not the
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for them so we work
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
really hard with Waypoint and other
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
groups who um service youth um it's
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
better for youth to be housed in a
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
different manner than at an adult
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
shelter so those two groups are
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
prioritized for us thank
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
you all right further from
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.630 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
chair

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
um you you you've mentioned this term of
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
art uh low barrier service something
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
like that um is is that a low barrier
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
standard uh requirement defined by the
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
federal government or through grants
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
that you've received what what what are
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
the circumstances under which the state
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
may change your designation and create a
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
little bit more of a
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
barrier I believe that's probably a
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
question for Kia um but it is in our
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
state contract uh we're a low barrier
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
shelter so um for example we accept sex
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
offenders we accept people who with a
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
criminal record um we accept uh folks
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
who other shelters may or may not be
 
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
able to accept um and that's what makes
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
it low barrier some many of our folks
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
are using substances they um you abuse
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol and or drugs um and as long as
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
they can be safe for themselves and for
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
the other folks who are with us um that
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
is okay uh we work with them on if they
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
want to go to treatment um but as long
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
as they can kind of hold themselves
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
together and it's a safe place for them
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
to be it's better for them to be in a
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
safe place every single night get a meal
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
um and talk with people about their
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
sobriety uh when they have a place to
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
sleep thank you any further questions
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham um just just uh
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
looking looking at the numbers uh uh
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
there's 46 beds in the family shelter
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
and another 138 so it's total of
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
184 capacity so um if your costs are 45
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
a day you're looking at roughly $3
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
million a year in operating costs that
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't include any Capital needs you
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
have like your boiler and roof for
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
building repair and so on correct so uh
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
obviously the community um really
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
admires what you're doing they've been
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
much anything further from the committee
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%

and we're coming up on the on the time
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
that we allotted for this there's
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
another a group meeting in the other
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
here thank you for hearing me uh Mr
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the house
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
finance committee um just for the record
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca Beaton I'm the
 
01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
executive director for 100 nights in
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
Kean New Hampshire we do currently
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
provide overnight shelter Services um as
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
well as providing day services in our
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
Resource Center we serve up to 48
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
individuals including men women and
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
families which does include minors
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
additionally we provide um the day
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
Services three meals a day during the
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
week weekends we work with Partners in
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
the community to provide um food we have
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
a case manager on staff for both our
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
existing guests as well as potentially
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
um individuals who have the potential to
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
become homeless to help them prevent
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
that we do have a case manager on staff
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
that works with anybody who comes into
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
the shelter um and needs those Services
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
um we did just recently increase from 24
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
beds to 48 beds with the construction of
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
our new
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
facility um and the space potentially
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
has capacity for more um once we get
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
approval from the city um so this
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
definitely does assist that process um
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
but again we are trying to really fill
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
the like our beds are at full capacity
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
every night um if we have a vacancy it's
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
filled almost immediately um for numbers
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the last week we do keep this track
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
for the census um for the state we
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
actually had to turn away 21 individuals
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
including a family of three um and that
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
is typical for any week that you would
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
look at um and it does actually get
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
worse over the colder months um we do
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
continue to receive the funding from the
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
state grant and aid program um the
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
increase from $8 to $20 definitely
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
helped and this will be um definitely
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
beneficial to continue with more
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
sustainable funding it doesn't reflect
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
the full cost of the shelter bed as been
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
said before um let alone the additional
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
Services we provide um
 
01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:11.549 align:start position:0%
Services we provide um
the

01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
sorry the average cost for 100 nights
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
based on our 2023 operating expenses was
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
4280 that is just for shelter Services
 
01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
once we include all of the day services
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
that also provides services to people
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
$648 um we do rely upon mostly
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
philanthropic and so that is uh
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
unguaranteed money and so that does
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
cause concern for the services that we
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
can continue to provide um that gives us
 
01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.470 align:start position:0%
can continue to provide um that gives us
about

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
$770,000 in philanthropic funding that
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
we are trying to get and that is a big
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
deficit that could be really hard to
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
close if those were to go away so the
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
more funding that can be guaranteed
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
is better for the shelter to be able to
 
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.029 align:start position:0%
is better for the shelter to be able to
stay

01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
stay
 
01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:02.839 align:start position:0%
sustainable um that obviously does
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
impact whether or not we can provide the
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
day Services as U Maria had mentioned
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
that could potentially mean that we
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
close the shelter during the day and
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
stop providing those day Services adding
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
those people back into the population
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
walking around in our um downtown area
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
and that you know can cause its own
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
problems um we're committed to our work
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
we are we have some great supporters
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
but again um it's just it's not secure
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
funding and that can be a real big
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
concern um we did start out as just a um
 
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
hundred nights we were open for the
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
hundred coldest nights of the year that
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
is hence our name in 2017 we did become
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
yearround shelter because the need grew
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
um and then with the pandemic we have
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
been at full capacity ever since um the
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic started and federal funding
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
helped and but it's gone um so now we
 
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
are very much just relying on on all of
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
that um I do welcome any questions and I
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
do have a written testimony here that I
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
can provide as well appreciate for the
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%

um my name is Michelle Meritt and the
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%
president at new Futures I'm going to
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
make this short and quick because you've
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
heard from um others who have really
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
covered this topic but I wanted to State
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
for the record new future support of
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 406 um and particularly for
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
the overlap between individuals with
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
substance misuse um disorders mental
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
illness and who are experiencing
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
homelessness that this uh particular
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation fills a critical
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
Gap and helps to stabilize those that
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
are serving our most vulnerable Granite
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
Staters so with that I just wanted to
 
01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
Again State new Futures support for this
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation I'm

happy to answer questions but again I
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
think many of them have already been
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
answered and I'm have written testimony
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
that I will submit to the
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
