thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
children and family law I'll just do a
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
sound check first can you hear me well
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you great and I did
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
dress up I didn't realize
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
well it makes me feel better so
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
um my bill is House Bill 541 relative to
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
the priority of child support payments
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
over other court costs and expenses as
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
we as I keep learning about Family Court
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
there are lots of different kinds of
 
00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:02.150 align:start position:0%
there are lots of different kinds of
expenses

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
so the text it really speaks for itself
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
in any proceeding to enforce the payment
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
of Child Support which would bring up
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
the thought of somebody claiming that
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
they no longer can afford their child
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
support so they would come to court or
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
be asked to come to court when they
 
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
didn't pay uh so in anything proceeding
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
to enforce the payment both parents
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
shall submit a financial affidavit
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
regarding income from all sources
 
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
including those used to pay all costs
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
either assessed by the court or
 
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
optionally associated with the preceding
 
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
such as but not limited to fees for
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
Guardian Ad Litem visitation centers and
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
legal representation
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
and the payment shall have priority over
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
the payment of all other costs assessed
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
by the court
 
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
payment of Child Support shall have
 
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
priority over the payment of all other
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
costs assessed by the court are
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
associated there is uh from from the sad
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
stories that I've learned and I'm sure
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
child support is critical
 
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it doesn't come first
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
and when children grow up in poverty
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
they they do not thrive
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like this is
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
supposition because I don't have any
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
proof of it but it sounds like the state
 
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
does not have a lot of money to spend on
 
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.070 align:start position:0%
does not have a lot of money to spend on
financial

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.970 align:start position:0%
financial
um

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
let's see there's a special word for it
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
but it means digging into somebody's
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
finances so we're pretty much left to uh
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh trust what the parents
 
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.210 align:start position:0%
uh trust what the parents
display

00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
display
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
and my concern is that there are lots of
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
kids not getting child support who then
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
are being supported
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh on the not so wonderful amount of
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
money that our welfare can provide
 
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:18.980 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
my main concern is the children
 
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
but as taxpayers we could also be
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
concerned that some parents are not
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
paying and uh putting the burden on the
 
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.610 align:start position:0%
paying and uh putting the burden on the
state

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
and it's not you know it would be hard
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
to maintain a home
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh based on the welfare payments and
 
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:40.940 align:start position:0%
again I'm using
 
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.019 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned terms because I'm sure
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
there's a better term than to say
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
welfare but State support which of
 
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
course is critical when a for a child to
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
have some kind of support
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
um so that's really my whole concern is
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
is the children and the fact that they
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
all don't always get child support from
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
parents who can't afford it but don't
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
have to prove it and it's not easily not
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
easily proven
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I would like it to be a requirement
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
that they show where they're getting the
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
money to go to court to pay their uh
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
other assessed because they may not be
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
showing that we know for sure they don't
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
always show it and my information comes
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
from people who have worked for a safe
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
place and Haven for many years
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll just open myself to
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
any questions should you have some
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
um I have a question so in this bill
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
um you're stating that
 
00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:50.459 align:start position:0%
their their child support shall have
 
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
priority over payment of all other costs
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
and expenses so does that include their
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
attorney are we going to be denying
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
people due process and the right to have
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
an attorney represent them
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
and and I parenting plan case
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
that's not denying people
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
to have representation
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
the usually the situation that I'm
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about is when one parent has
 
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
representation because they can afford
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
it and the other parent does not this is
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
an attempt to level the playing field so
 
00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:34.579 align:start position:0%
that both parents both parents have to
 
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
have to ex let's see what's the right
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
word disclose the money that they're
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
using in court so that would include
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
attorney fees that's not to stop anybody
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
from having representation it's just to
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
show both parents
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
on an equal unequal footing
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
thank you and I paid by the way I paid
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
child support for a few years for my son
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm not speaking from oh this is a
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
certain sex
 
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
uh oriented I I completely understand
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from I am still
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
currently till this day owed seventy
 
00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in child support so I I
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
completely understand where you're
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
coming from but I would never deny my
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
children's father
 
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.329 align:start position:0%
children's father
um

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
the right to have an attorney I'm not
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
this bill does not deny anybody from
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
having an attorney no way does it deny
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
it it's just saying that if you're
 
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.009 align:start position:0%
it it's just saying that if you're
spending

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
however much on an attorney
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
you need to disclose where that money
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
came from you have a rich Uncle who's
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
giving you the money and saying oh here
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
I'll give you it but when somebody is
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
self-employed they don't always have to
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
disclose their income and yet uh the
 
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
saddest stories I've heard from a person
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
who supported people going to court who
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
are victims of domestic abuse but this
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
would apply to anybody
 
00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:06.769 align:start position:0%
would apply to anybody
um

00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
to have a person file and say I'm too
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
poor to pay this child support them
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's been assessed to me but they're
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
being represented by a very famous
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
attorney and everybody knows how
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
expensive they are
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
representative gray so just for Clarity
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
on my own Clarity uh the proceedings to
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
enforce child support payment so if
 
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
if I'm bringing my spouse because of
 
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
failure to pay child support and I have
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
an attorney I'm still going to claim
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
that however I still get to keep my
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
attorney because I'm not the one I'm not
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
the one that has a child support issue
 
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
however if I'm the one going to court
 
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
because I failed to pay child support
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I owe two thousand dollars but my my
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh disclosure shows that I paid five
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying the judge will look at
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
that and say you're going to take 2 000
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
out of that five and give it to your
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
child so you're not really saying no you
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
can't get a lawyer uh but you are saying
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
priority is child support over my five
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the lawyer is that
 
00:15:26.699 --> 00:15:28.129 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the lawyer is that
correct

00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative you have really
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative gay
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
when in your bill it states a parent
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
shall submit a financial affidavit
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
are you are you aware if they're already
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
filling out that financial affidavit
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
prior to attending a child support
 
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
prior to attending a child support
hearing

00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
is it my turn
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
yep he asked you the question okay
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I think that a fine a financial
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
affidavit is standard standard for the
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
course uh what is not what was explained
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
to me a couple of years ago is that you
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to put down how
 
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
is anybody going to know
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
if you are receiving if you are uh have
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
more income than you're showing
 
00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:32.930 align:start position:0%
more income than you're showing
um

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's just a giveaway when you show up in
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
court and say
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
I can't pay this I'm too poor but you
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
have representation that everybody knows
 
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
have representation that everybody knows
cost

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
oh easily a thousand dollars
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
so that's the the point here I'm uh
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
trying to make it broad enough that the
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
situation you think of would fit
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
so could you narrow this clarify it a
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
follow us
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.689 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
so my concern would be
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
I guess if
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the question yeah I'm just trying to
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
formulate it so if the parent who is
 
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:27.740 align:start position:0%
trying if the parent was trying to fight
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
the child support
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
because they are splitting custody
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
does this would this preclude them from
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
having to
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
pay for pay for child support while this
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's a technical legal question that I
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
do not
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
do not know I'm just pointing out the
 
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.789 align:start position:0%
do not know I'm just pointing out the
goal

00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
that if somebody can afford
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
um all these other court fees including
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to an attorney
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
they can pay all these others but they
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
can't pay child support that that says
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's a problem the child
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
she can't unmute
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
there we go I couldn't unmute I don't
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
know what was going on there
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much good morning
 
00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.210 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much good morning
everybody

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative gay for the
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
question uh just
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if um the New Hampshire
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
administrative Justice of the circuit
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
court has reviewed this and what their
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
opinion is and what they've um
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
what they've told you about
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
how this would work
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
I have not received any I did not ask I
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
didn't know who who I would be showing
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
it to but I also you know since this is
 
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.450 align:start position:0%
it to but I also you know since this is
public

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:16.460 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I certainly get uh messages from
 
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
people who are concerned about the
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
subject of bills as we all get lots of
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
them uh no one has come no one has
 
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299 align:start position:0%
contacted me to give an opinion uh and
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
I'd certainly be concerned about a
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
negative opinion
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
sure may follow up Madam chair
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
um so representative K my second ask is
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
is this um
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
is this bill based on the other states
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
are doing this do do we have an example
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
of other states that
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
um bump child support payments above
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
um the above legal fees
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
I am not aware of what other states do
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh however I know we're not the worst
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
um we're not the worst in our priorities
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
well there's something yeah yeah
 
00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:24.299 align:start position:0%
my poor husband went through this in
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
Ohio and whereas we were concerned about
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
visitation rights they were so far
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
behind they were just concerned to make
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
sure people were paying their child
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
support so uh it didn't get more
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
sophisticated than that that we knew of
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
and of course he did he paid very
 
00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:42.230 align:start position:0%
and of course he did he paid very
consistently

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.010 align:start position:0%
consistently
um

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
no it would be interesting but if
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
another state is not concerned about
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
this I don't mind being in the Forefront
 
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
and bringing it to the attention that
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Litchfield
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
did you have a question can you use the
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
raise the hand thing on there because I
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
won't always see you actually raising
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
your hand yes absolutely thank you thank
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you
 
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
um I feel as though this bill definitely
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
has the purest of intent
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
um I do know though as I've read through
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
it and pondered over it
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
um the past couple of days I have some
 
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.830 align:start position:0%
um the past couple of days I have some
confusion

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
um and if I may ask two questions one
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand if there
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
was an outsider helping to fund the
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
legal bills how is that relevant so if
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
the uncle steps in or the grandfather
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
steps in how is that relevant is my
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
from a moral point of view
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
oh I'm not being polite I really do
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate all your questions I just get
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
nervous and forget the formality
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
um if if a person's
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
is being subsidized by someone else
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
that is income
 
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
and it should be declared
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
just because you have a rich Uncle who
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
says oh here's a few thousand dollars
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to see you quote
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
lose in court
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's income they ought to be concerned
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
about the kids if they've got enough
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
money to spend on attorney they've got
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
enough money to help support those
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
children that's my opinion and that's my
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
moral platform
 
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.610 align:start position:0%
moral platform
so

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair may I follow up on that
 
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
and still ask the other question would
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
that be okay yep okay thank you
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
um so my question is I'm just trying to
 
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
I and again I understand where you're
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
coming from the pr 710 I'm trying to
 
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.330 align:start position:0%
coming from the pr 710 I'm trying to
understand

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
it is not the rich uncle's obligation to
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
pay child support it is not his child so
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
if someone is really in a position where
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
they are really truly unable to afford
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
exorbitant child support bills and there
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
is a family member or a friend that is
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
willing to step in and say I will help
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
you with these legal fees to make this
 
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.950 align:start position:0%
you with these legal fees to make this
right

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
I feel as though we're looking to deny
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
that and that's just what I'm trying to
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand so please understand I'm not
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
trying to be combative I'm trying to
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
understand the situation where is your
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
question though my I guess my question
 
00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
question though my I guess my question
is

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
why would it be the responsibility of
 
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
the person funding the attorney for
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
example the uncle to pay child support
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
which I believe that representative gay
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
answered okay
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and then I can answer it again it's
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
not their obligation to pay but it is
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
income for the person who's not paying
 
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.070 align:start position:0%
income for the person who's not paying
okay

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:50.649 --> 00:23:50.659 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
the follow-up
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
I do and if this is if this is not
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
if this is not specifically a question
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
please stop me
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
um again I'm just trying to wrap my head
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
around it I feel like it's um I feel
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
like it's kind of a vicious circle or
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
cycle if someone is continuing to go to
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
court because maybe they can't afford
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
the child support but yeah we're pulling
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
the attorney fees out ahead of time I
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
don't know I feel like it it sounds like
 
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:18.299 align:start position:0%
a circular cycle and again my question
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
is trying to understand right so
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Litchfield I believe this
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
would be something for a work session
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
because it really isn't a direct
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
question for um the sponsor
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
um because I feel like you keep coming
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
back to the same question and I and I
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to get at
 
00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:41.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
may I attempt one brief response
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you very much I
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
promise this is it
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm my goal is to level the playing
 
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
I'm my goal is to level the playing
field

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
the questions were asked of me before
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
this is the second time I entered this
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
this uh subject
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
if a if one person says I can't pay
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
chances are the other person doesn't
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
have money
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
so if we're interested in being equal
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
and fair
 
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
the person who doesn't have money for an
 
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.789 align:start position:0%
the person who doesn't have money for an
attorney

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
is not being represented by by a rich
 
00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:25.490 align:start position:0%
is not being represented by by a rich
uncle

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
uncle
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
and if they are they ought to be able to
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
declare that too so the whole goal is to
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
make things equal and fair we can't make
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
their incomes equal but we can be fair
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
and treat them both equally
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.450 align:start position:0%

questions

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify an opposition
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 541 I will note that I
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
testified in opposition to a near
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
identical Bill last session which was
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1193 which this committee
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
voted in expedient to legislate in a
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
unanimous 18-0 vote
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
I want to First address the issue of the
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
financial affidavits raised by
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative gay under Family Division
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
rule 2.16 in all cases in which support
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
is in any way involved each party is
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
required to file with the court in
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
exchange with the other party a
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit at least seven days
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
prior to any hearing
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
on that financial affidavit parties must
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
indicate all sources and amounts of
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
income and expenses so lines three
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
through six of this bill
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
apparently as this is already a required
 
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
Court practice
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
as to the issue of prioritizing child
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
support payments I think we can all
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
agree that paying child support is an
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
important obligation and non-payment of
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
Child Support should carry penalties but
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is create an access
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
to justice issue and an access to
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
service issue so I'm just going to give
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
you an example I hope this is will help
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
maybe clarify things so consider an
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
unmarried couple with two kids the dad
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
has been abusing mom for the duration of
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
their relationship dad had a decent job
 
00:29:05.649 --> 00:29:05.659 align:start position:0%
during the relationship but right before
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
the petition he decides he doesn't like
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
that job anymore which was a relatively
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
high paying job and decides he's going
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
to take a minimum wage job
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
he uses the fact that Mom now works much
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
more than him and makes significantly
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
more than him so the kids should stay
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
with him the majority of the time and
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
mom should pay him child support
 
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
so Mom needs to hire a lawyer to help
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
the court see that he is now voluntarily
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
underemployed but she may not be able to
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
do that under this bill
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
so because Mom was unrepresented
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
um abusive dad gets parenting time that
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
may not be in the best interest of the
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
children and as a result mom the victim
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
becomes responsible for paying a child
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
support award when she should be
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
receiving child support
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
in addition this bill is asking to pit
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
support and contact between a parent and
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
child against one another child support
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
is important and contact between parent
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
and a child may be important it may be
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
that the contact can only happen at a
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation center that
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
requires a fee having to pick one or the
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
other seems like an impossible choice
 
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
for those parents
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
lastly the language in lines eight
 
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
through nine is vague and is likely to
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
lead to confusion the bill describes
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
that all other costs associated with the
 
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.230 align:start position:0%
that all other costs associated with the
proceedings

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
um that that those need to come
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
secondary to paying child support but
 
00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:39.419 align:start position:0%
does that include payment of health
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
insurance does that include payment of a
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage or rent is unclear with the
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
language currently in this bill so I
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I'm happy to
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and that's all I have thank you
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for Miss Jacina
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair uh Mr
 
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair uh Mr
Cena

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
Cena
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
currently on the uh like you said
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
between three and five is currently
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
happening so these um
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
these affidavits do they include a gift
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
I got from a family member
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
so that's a really good question I
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question thank you so
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
that absolutely absolutely should be
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
disclosed on a financial affidavit I
 
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
will also point out that the financial
 
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
affidavit is not the only document that
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
the parties have to exchange there is
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
something called mandatory disclosures
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's rule 1.25 a under Family Division
 
00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:48.830 align:start position:0%
it's rule 1.25 a under Family Division
rules

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
um this was really meant to level the
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
playing field
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
um because when parties are represented
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
they often exchange Financial Discovery
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's called interrogatories but if
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
you're unrepresented you may not know to
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
do that so the court did level the
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
playing fields and said that all parties
 
00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:12.419 align:start position:0%
have to comply with 1.25 a which is an
 
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
exchange of financial documents in
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
addition to the financial affidavit so
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
that would be bank statements mortgage
 
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.710 align:start position:0%
that would be bank statements mortgage
statements

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
statements
 
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.549 align:start position:0%
statements
um

00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit information it
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
depends there are different requirements
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
if you're married or unmarried but
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
the financial affidavit is not the only
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
financial document that is required uh
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
in these cases
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up Madam chair yes
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you uh now with the
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
example you gave I
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
I couldn't follow what the I couldn't
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
follow what the uh what the issue was
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
um you know on the I'm the abuser who is
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
seeking child support and you're saying
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
this will have the
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
mother uh not be able to afford an
 
00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:05.930 align:start position:0%
mother uh not be able to afford an
attorney

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
well so because you've got to prioritize
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
child support payments right under this
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
so she wants to comply wants to pay her
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
child support but also needs an attorney
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
to show that the child support order
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
that the court may have issued is
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
incorrect because he's underemployed and
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not skilled or doesn't
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
understand the court rules I mean
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
attorneys have a hard time doing this so
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
someone who is self-represented trying
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
to go to court against her abuser to
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
show that a child support Ward is
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
incorrect and or that the award should
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
go to her
 
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
would be really challenging to do
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
without an attorney and I think that's
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it essentially says
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
you can't get an attorney and that's an
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
access to justice issue okay just one
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
more follow-up if I may it'll be brief
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
um so am I hearing you correctly I want
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
to be clear on what you're saying so I'm
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
hearing you correctly that it's it's
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
it's more important for the mother in
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
this example to be able to use her money
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
for an attorney than it is to pay child
 
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.270 align:start position:0%
for an attorney than it is to pay child
support

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
I'm saying it's an access to justice
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
issue to make sure that the person who
 
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
should be receiving the child support
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
and the correct child support award that
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
that is important child I'm not
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
disputing that child support is an
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
important obligation and that children
 
00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:41.339 align:start position:0%
should absolutely come first but we need
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the child support
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
award is going to the appropriate parent
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes the way to do that
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
because abusers can use the system to
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
work against the victim sometimes the
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
way to do that is to hire an attorney
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I will also point out that when the
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
litigation is going on if there's a
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
child support award there's in a rearage
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
building it's not saying this person's
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
not going to be responsible for child
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
support there will be in a rearage
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
building and that money will be owed at
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
some point to one of the parties once
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
are you outside representative
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
seeing representative on your good
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
of being done thank you very much
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
and is there anyone else ahead of time
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
um good uh good morning uh uh Madam
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee my
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
name is Richard head I'm the government
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
Affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
branch we don't have any position on
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
this bill I just and normally these are
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
comments that I would make in a work
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
session but I honestly don't know how
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
work sessions work this year
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to to raise a couple
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
points which which really relate to just
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of how this bill would
 
00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:26.030 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of how this bill would
work

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and what the court system's role
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
would be so if if for example if there's
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
priority to child support
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
but a lawyer has been paid by a retainer
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
how does that impact the retainer if a
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
child if if the costs or payments are
 
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.069 align:start position:0%
child if if the costs or payments are
um

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
are charged by the court and child
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
support is an ongoing obligation how
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
would that work if the first child
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
support payment is made payment of the
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
costs and fees are made but then
 
00:36:59.690 --> 00:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
subsequent child support is not made
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
does that somehow impact
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
um how those fees and costs are being
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
paid or is there some other obligation
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
so it's more or less just the mechanics
 
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
that are unclear in the language of the
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill which I would normally talk through
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
in a work session
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
but not knowing the process this year
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just raising it as questions for the
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
committee to consider this year thank
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
you and by the way I don't pretend to be
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
an expert in in family law on the court
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
process for family law but just have
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
these these concerns but again the court
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
system has no position relative to the
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
policies in this bill
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank

I'm ready Madam chair
yes

00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll open the hearing on
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 228
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I will call up a representative Deb
 
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.890 align:start position:0%
and I will call up a representative Deb
DeSimone

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
DeSimone
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Dallas Sayer can you hear
 
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.470 align:start position:0%
representative Dallas Sayer can you hear
me

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
um and members of the committee and the
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
father who was his name
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
that was Bill 228 uh
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
it is relative to the calculation of
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
classified increases with equal or
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunately equal parenting time is
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
given to those parents and it seems to
 
00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
be an inequity in that area of the law
 
00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.150 align:start position:0%
be an inequity in that area of the law
and

00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
um so that's why this bill was brought
 
00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.849 align:start position:0%
um so that's why this bill was brought
forward

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:04.220 align:start position:0%
and I will
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:11.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative DeSimone so you
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
won't be taking questions you'll be
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
deferring them to attorney Markel that
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
is correct okay great all right so next
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
up we have Marilyn Mahoney he's taken
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair hello and good
 
00:40:37.619 --> 00:40:38.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair hello and good
morning

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm an attorney who has practiced in
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
family law for about 40 years I did
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
submit a summary of my testimony to the
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
committee by email this morning
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
um in effect this bill
 
00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.870 align:start position:0%
um in effect this bill
um

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
as well as a bill that you're hearing
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
later today
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 161 I believe both addressed
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
the issue of what happens for child
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
support when parents have
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
well in one bill it's called shared
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
parenting time and in the other bill
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's called equal or approximately
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
equals parenting time
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
if this bill uses the term I believe
 
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
um equal or approximately equal
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it refers to any of those cases in
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
which there is quote a disparity of
 
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.530 align:start position:0%
which there is quote a disparity of
income

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:35.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
the two bills that are before the
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
committee are in are conflict uh in in
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
some significant ways
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
and they also would make a significant
 
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
change in what the current law is I
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the committee
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind that
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
every family every
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
parent and every parent's economic
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
situation and and family situation is
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
different and unique
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
concern I have particularly with this
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
bill is that it creates a rebuttable
 
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.849 align:start position:0%
bill is that it creates a rebuttable
presumption

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
the rebuttable presumption is really the
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
biggest flaw I believe this bill has
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
because it in effect
 
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:26.780 align:start position:0%
over would override
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
existing Provisions in New Hampshire law
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
that allows the court or the parties
 
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
um negotiate a settlement
 
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
from being able to take into
 
00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
consideration the various factors so for
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
example it is the case I believe in most
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
families where one parent is going to be
 
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
paying for daycare one parent is going
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
to be buying more clothes that may not
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
be the same parent
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
one parent is going to be incurring more
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
of the expenses for a child say for
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
school supplies or or extracurricular
 
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.230 align:start position:0%
school supplies or or extracurricular
activities

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.770 align:start position:0%
activities
that

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.349 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
the the results in uh um
 
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
even though they have equal time or
 
00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:21.500 align:start position:0%
approximately equal time not an equal
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
economic impact and those factors which
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
I said are currently allowed to be
 
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
considered in in current law would be
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
overridden by creating a rebuttable
 
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.910 align:start position:0%
overridden by creating a rebuttable
presumption

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
and I think that using that term is
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
problematic the formula that's laid out
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
that is that you do a set off between
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
each party's income is commonly used now
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's not required by law but people do
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
it all the time use it all the time as a
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
kind of a guideline and it in in and of
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
itself I don't believe is a bad idea I
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
think the bad idea in this bill is
 
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
making it a rebuttable presumption
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
given that there are these two competing
 
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
bills and the other bill is is much more
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
complex in terms of the changes it makes
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
to existing law
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
it would be my suggestion to the
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
committee to perhaps have these both
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
bills referred to an interim study and
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
look at those kinds of changes that
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
would be made to current law and look
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
for a way to equitably
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and reasonably
 
00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
um and reasonably
um

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
implement the concept of the formula
 
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.329 align:start position:0%
implement the concept of the formula
without

00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:38.990 align:start position:0%
without
shortchanging

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:39.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:39.849 --> 00:44:39.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
families that are struggling in any case
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
trying to make ends meet with children
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
that completes my testimony
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
up next is Brenda town a member of her
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
of the public to speak in our position
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
she's asked for three minutes
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
oh good morning everybody and thank you
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
for allowing the testimony today
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to start by saying I'm a
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
grandmother of four grandkids I've gone
 
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:24.380 align:start position:0%
through the family courts personally
 
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
that exposure had has led me to become
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
an advocate for parents I currently lead
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
um a couple New Hampshire parents
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
organizations one with 3 500 followers
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
on Facebook where we try to help parents
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
navigate their way through family court
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
issues and also to become stronger and
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
better family units I'm going to be
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
speaking on child support today on
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
multiple calls but I did want to speak
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
specifically to this issue for the past
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
two and a half years I've worked with
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
both the sponsors committee members and
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
the UNH research team that was
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
commissioned to address child support in
 
00:46:05.809 --> 00:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to touch quickly on
 
00:46:10.089 --> 00:46:10.099 align:start position:0%
the history of What's led us here today
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
and why this year this family court
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
sorry this uh child and family law
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee really owes it to the judges
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the families to make a directive on
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
how we address this Gap in our
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislation so in 2015 HB 378 was
 
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
introduced it was a shared parenting
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
bill but it was transitioned into a
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
study to be commissioned by UNH car seat
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
school on our entire child support
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
situation here in New Hampshire
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
in 2018 They concluded their study and
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
they prepared that for review here for
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
this Committee in 2019 UNH came to this
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
committee and presented their results
 
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately there was a
 
00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
significant calculation error in their
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
report on shared parenting that didn't
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
get corrected until January of 2020.
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
unh's study was exhaustive it took
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
multiple years and it cost this state
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
the study concluded with three important
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations and one of those
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations was that we needed a
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
standardized calculation for Shared
 
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.690 align:start position:0%
standardized calculation for Shared
Parenting

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
Parenting
 
00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
complicating the situation is we have
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
two Supreme Court cases in the state of
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that have now taken the
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
discretion of our family court judges
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
away in determining family
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
um sorry shared child support
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
cases in equitable distribution of child
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
support in 2018 there was a k Silva V
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
Silva which it was ruled in the state of
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that the family court
 
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:02.180 align:start position:0%
judge could not
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
allocate anything different than the
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
child support calculator unless there
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
was a determination that fixed costs
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
were reduced on the obligee's side so
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
what that did is it prevented a judge
 
00:48:19.569 --> 00:48:19.579 align:start position:0%
from making a a call of smoothing out
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
those child support cases where parents
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
were sharing significant time and
 
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
were sharing significant time and
expenses

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
this was followed in 2019 with Case
 
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
Anderson V Anderson in our own New
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court which then
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
basically pushed back the responsibility
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
of determining an equitable child
 
00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:41.470 align:start position:0%
of determining an equitable child
support

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
calculation for parents
 
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
um in the um case of shared child
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
support back to this family committee
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
because there is no legislation that a
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
judge can use to make an equitable
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
determination of Child Support so I know
 
00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of language guys but I
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
thought it was important you had that
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
history because there's a lot of effort
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
that brought this committee to this
 
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.069 align:start position:0%
that brought this committee to this
point

00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
last year and the year before we had a
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
bill that was brought before this
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee HB 362. it is identical to
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
Deb's bill today it was put out for
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
interim study the challenges with the
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill were that it didn't
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me please refer to the
 
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
members as representative de Simone okay
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh representative D Simone um
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh brought to the committee this bill
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
that is um in line with the HB 362 that
 
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
this committee had reviewed the prior
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
two years HB 362 was put out for interim
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
study and was was actually passed by
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
this committee to not bring for a vote
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
because it is missing some critical
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
information it doesn't Define parenting
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
time it doesn't Define approximate or
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time it doesn't reflect
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
any of the UNH recommendations and it
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover the spectrum of parenting
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
time other than approximate or equal
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
so what I would recommend and what I'm
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to recommend today is that the
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee take under consideration HP
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
161 which is a comprehensive bill that
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
reflects the half a million dollar study
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has
 
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.210 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has
commissioned

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.220 align:start position:0%
commissioned
 
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
I need you to stay on 228 you can
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
testify to 161 at the next hearing
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
people to testify on this specific Bill
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
okay I will I'm sorry Deb uh sorry
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
representative rice I I chair rice I
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
will try to stay on task so my my uh
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill are not that um in
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
fact we are addressing the shortcoming
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
in our legislation but that
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is uh falls short
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
um in the areas that were identified in
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
last session preventing us from moving
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill to the floor for
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
a vote thank you very much
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
all right staying done thank you very
 
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.690 align:start position:0%
all right staying done thank you very
much

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
up next is um Aaron Justina to speak in
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
support and she's requested two minutes
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you um I actually need
 
00:51:35.329 --> 00:51:35.339 align:start position:0%
to correct that we are
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
um signing in in opposition to this bill
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
and I will just say
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
um that we agree with Marilyn Mahoney
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
um in referring this bill to interim
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
study thank you and I apologize for the
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
inconvenience no problem thank you so
 
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
hey see you again thank you and up next
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
is um attorney Jane Markle and he put
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
down zero minutes but I'm gonna let you
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
have a few okay oh okay uh thank you um
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
I had signed in I thought for five
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
minutes uh briefly to address this bill
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
what it does is I have also submitted
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
some uh some written information on it
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh basically what this bill does is IT
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
addresses disparity of income issues the
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
offset method as was previously
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
testified to is a very well accepted way
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
of equalizing the child support between
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
the parties uh between the party's
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
income so it's pretty it's pretty easy
 
00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:39.559 align:start position:0%
to understand it's simple to calculate
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
the holes in the law that it tries to
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
address are the Draconian results of
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
Silva uh which was previously alluded to
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
um contrary to what I think I heard
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
before there is absolutely nothing in
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
this bill that in any way limits the
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
balance of our RSA Force 458 C5 because
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
it leaves intact and provides for
 
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
additional flexibility additional
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
arguments to be made as to why a child
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
support should be up or down the
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
presumptive order means that it's a
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption rebuttable
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
presumptions exist fairly all over the
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
place in law and what this does is is
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
that in essence it allows courts to
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
craft individual solutions to to the
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
problems that that come in four of it in
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
terms of determining child support so
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
the calculations are real simple it's
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
done as first in the first instance as
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
if parent a plays parent B then if
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
parent B were to pay parent a then take
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
the difference in the support order and
 
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
the difference in the support order in
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
the first instance goes to the lower
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
income parent as the child support
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's presumptive now all the other
 
00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
side really has to do is just look at
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
the balance of the statute because it
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
retains all of the virtues of the
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
existing statute it retains RSA uh
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
um 458 C5 adjustments to the
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
applications of the guidelines under
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
special circumstances so what it does
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
and contrary to the representations I
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
heard is gives enormous flexibility to a
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
court to be able to craft individual
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
solutions to a problem nobody gets
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
painted into a corner it allows the
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
court to consider the parenting schedule
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
it does not and I think it's pretty well
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
understood what equal or approximately
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time is it should not be
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
micromanaged priorities are free to
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
argue their cases as to whether they
 
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
whether or not they actually do have
 
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
equal or approximately equal parenting
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
time uh the courts can figure out what
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
that is that can be a variety of
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
circumstances it can be one week with
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
one parent one week with another parent
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
that can be a shared residential program
 
00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
or it can be any number of days in
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
between as the parties out okay remember
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
this is not one size fits all this is
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
designed so that the courts have
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility to stay within the
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
guidelines and create individuals and
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
create individual orders that are fair
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
and once again the person who spoke
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
before said
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
the Silva case presented as I pointed
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
out in my written testimony presents
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
Draconian options where they're simply
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
not necessary the Anderson case as I
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
remember presented something similar to
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
this uh to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
Court and the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
Court said your argument is not with us
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's with the legislature so this is
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
entirely appropriate in addition to
 
00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:52.790 align:start position:0%
entirely appropriate in addition to
which

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts below uh tried using uh
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
percentage-based formulas they found out
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
that in their situation on a six on a
 
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
six-year study that it simply wasn't
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
workable this will and basically what
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does is solve the problems it
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
provides predictable results it also has
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
the regular checks to make sure that the
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
child that the child support order is
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
adequate and that's why that language
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
stays in there it changes very little
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
but just what it does is solve a problem
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
and it does that rather effectively
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
using well-accepted means
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your time would be happy
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:49.069 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you it takes about four clicks to
 
00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
get unmuted so uh thanks for your
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
patience and thank you for taking my
 
00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.930 align:start position:0%
patience and thank you for taking my
question

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at this legislation and
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
it is an entirely
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
um new paragraph to be added into
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
statute and the part that I'm struggling
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
with and I I need some clarification
 
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.910 align:start position:0%
with and I I need some clarification
because

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I just don't understand this is lines
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
10 through 12 okay so the amount of
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
child support payment shall then be
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
calculated according to the guidelines
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
as if the higher income party were to
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
pay the lower income party
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
calculated as if the lower income party
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
were to pay the higher income party so
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
that just I
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
in my experience and I will admit it's
 
00:57:43.559 --> 00:57:44.809 align:start position:0%
in my experience and I will admit it's
limited

00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
limited
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's not a thing
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
so when I when one party is at a
 
00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.609 align:start position:0%
so when I when one party is at a
significant

00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:57:52.619 --> 00:57:53.410 align:start position:0%
significant
um

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:53.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
income disparity to the other one
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
we don't make that calculation and so to
 
00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
insert that seems to be creating
 
00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
um creating a formula that's based on
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
an impossibility so I'm I'm really
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
confused about this okay I'm glad to a
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
good question happy to answer it what
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
happens is is that okay let me start off
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
by saying that neither the legislation
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh the present legislation nor Silva
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
actually defined what a disparity of
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
income was so uh to trigger a full
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
guidelines order so was that a
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
difference of a hundred dollars a month
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars a month two three
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars a month it's
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
unclear and the present legislation
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that okay uh now as to the
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
child support calculation it would go
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
um when I say parent a and parent B so
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
one parent let's say for the sake of
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
argument makes five thousand dollars a
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
month and the other one makes two
 
00:58:59.329 --> 00:58:59.339 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month and there's a
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollar disparity so the
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
parent making five thousand dollars a
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
month the calculation is the five
 
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar parent okay
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
does a calculation as if the five
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar parent were to pay the
 
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollar parent the two
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar parent then makes the
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
calculation as if the two thousand
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
dollar parent were to pay the five
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar parent the difference
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
between those two numbers okay you take
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
the higher you take the lower number
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
subtract it from the higher number okay
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
that difference goes to the lower income
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
parent okay and that's a presumptive
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
order now the rest of the statute States
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
completely in place and then the court
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
is free to do a check and not only that
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
the other party is free to argue that
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
that is not a correct order based on the
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
entire statute okay absolutely very
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
little changes
 
00:59:58.609 --> 00:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
um what it does is that it gives you
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
predictability so for example if a child
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
support order would a result from higher
 
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
to lower would be two hundred dollars a
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
month from the higher income parent and
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
the lower income parent would have paid
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
the higher income parent a hundred
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
dollars a month the difference is a
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that hundred dollars
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
goes to the lower income parent now if
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
for any reason that order is not deemed
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
adequate okay that party is free to
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
argue to the court but judge it's not
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
adequate and I'm going to ask you to
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
take into considerations the following
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
adjustments that we need to make it's
 
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
all right there in the statute and the
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
parties are free to argue all it does is
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
it gives you a jumping off point and
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
then the parties are free and it's going
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
to solve a big problem because I think
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
as attorney Mahoney indicated it's been
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
in common use well this does not
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
reinvent anything this is not new or
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
novel and point of fact I'm referring to
 
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh what I consider to be the Bible in
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
this particular case which is child
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
support guidelines and application by
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
Laura Morgan uh Second Edition from 2020
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
who's probably one of the leading
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
authorities in the United States on
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
child support she recognizes and has
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
been widely recognized is that the
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
offset method is what's being used okay
 
01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:21.059 align:start position:0%
to determine a lot of Child Support
 
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
calculations so this is nothing new it's
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
generally well accepted once again I
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
would refer to people who did a six-year
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
study the Massachusetts court system did
 
01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
a six-year study and they concluded in
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
their 2018 guidelines that percentages
 
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
don't work and they use a variation of
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
the same thing and we know what shared
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
residential responsibility is you know
 
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
if it's six days or approximately equal
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
courts can make that determination along
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
with the parties
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
um May I follow up
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.910 align:start position:0%
thank you so
um

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to keep up with you here and
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
my question now is do you think that
 
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.789 align:start position:0%
my question now is do you think that
this

01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
um as it's written here can be used to
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
put a price tag on parenting time
 
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand what you mean
 
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.770 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand what you mean
madam

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
would parenting time be given a a
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
denomination of value in the child
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
support well
 
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.849 align:start position:0%
support well
um

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
the idea Financial incentive
 
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.809 align:start position:0%
the idea Financial incentive
okay

01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
um well this kind of takes the financial
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
incentive out of it this is the whole
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
point because right now what you have is
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
child support driving the parenting plan
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
and people fighting over this what this
 
01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:51.140 align:start position:0%
does is this frees parents to be parents
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
and uh makes child support has to be
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
adequate but it also should be fair and
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
easy to determine and transparent and
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative Bachelor
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just I think one of the things
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know as this is written it assumes
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the parents are in agreement and if
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is you know if they're not in
 
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.130 align:start position:0%
there is you know if they're not in
agreement

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I guess my question would be in
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
line four
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
where like
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
how would a pro se parent know that they
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
have to know that there's a rebuttable
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
presumption and know what they have to
 
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.430 align:start position:0%
presumption and know what they have to
do

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.809 align:start position:0%
do
um to

01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
to repeat that
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
particularly if that's not you know an
 
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.829 align:start position:0%
particularly if that's not you know an
agreeable

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
agreeable
 
01:03:51.839 --> 01:03:53.569 align:start position:0%
agreeable
separation

01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
separation
 
01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:54.950 align:start position:0%
separation
well

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
um once again parties okay well the law
 
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
is published online and I respectfully
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
point out that parties really should be
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
reading the even Pro seis should be
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
looking at the law online to determine
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
what their rights and obligations are
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
now obviously that may or may not happen
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
Okay but
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
um you know there there's certainly free
 
01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:21.299 align:start position:0%
to look up a lot of sources it's there
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
the law is there for everyone to see and
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
one of the virtues of this is that it's
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
easy to understand let's put it this way
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
I can understand how it would be foreign
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
if you're not used to working with it
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay and it would confuse any and let's
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
put it this way I can understand that
 
01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
but when you're used to working with it
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
and the judges understand it and the
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
parties can look at that and say well
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
wait a minute
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I make this she makes that uh she
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
makes this he makes this I make that so
 
01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
this is what my child support payment
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
would be okay now I'm going to ask for
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
more money because the order wouldn't be
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
adequate from my point of view whether
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
you're whoever you are uh parenting time
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know that you can quantify it
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
but it involves Mutual obligation uh the
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
other thing is is that it frees parents
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to focus on their kids and
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
involve in parenting and develop a
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
parenting plan rather than fighting over
 
01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
the Draconian results of what would be a
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
ah thank you madam chair uh thank you uh
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
attorney Markle
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
um just to say when you answer my
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
question uh with all due respect I I get
 
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
it after a couple of sentences when you
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
get into the five or six I lose my whole
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
thought so it would help me if it would
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
just be precise
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so with respect to uh proceed do you
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
believe this would be more complicated
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
for them to figure out I think it would
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
be less complicated than a competing
 
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.309 align:start position:0%
be less complicated than a competing
bill

01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:06:01.319 --> 01:06:02.870 align:start position:0%
bill
okay

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and also on um if if both parties
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
came and agreed to everything is that
 
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
still eligible if this became law
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
um yes it is in fact what it does is it
 
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
allows for example it allows parties to
 
01:06:23.089 --> 01:06:23.099 align:start position:0%
argue their cases individually this
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
paints nobody into a corner okay so for
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
example I'll give you some scenarios if
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
I don't need I don't need a scenarios I
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
I because I'm going to get lost okay uh
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up Madam speaker no
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the parties arguing
 
01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:44.579 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about my question was on
 
01:06:44.579 --> 01:06:45.770 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about my question was on
if

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
if the two parties agree on everything
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
who's getting paid what who's paying for
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
the dance lessons they agree on
 
01:06:54.539 --> 01:06:56.029 align:start position:0%
the dance lessons they agree on
everything

01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
does this still have to be
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
um implied that do they still have to go
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
through this calculation
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay uh they probably do but let me
 
01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
explain that's just a function of Child
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
Support worksheets that's all because
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
every every child support case has to be
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
accompanied by child support worksheets
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
okay and then the court is free to make
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
of course thank you thank you attorney
 
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.609 align:start position:0%
of course thank you thank you attorney
Michael

01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:39.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to look at the uh I'm
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
trying to look at the content you know
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
contentious litigations
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
um you know very
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
hard calculation in my mind I mean I
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
know it's easy in your mind but in mine
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
um how this will impact you know I'm
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
looking for you know they don't see an
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity where
 
01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.950 align:start position:0%
opportunity where
um

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
there's an incentive to uh not be
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
forthcoming on some issues when you're
 
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
when you're doing the calculation like
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
this because let's see at my real five
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar a month salary I pay
 
01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:25.970 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar a month salary I pay
this

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
but at my 4500
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
dollar salary I'll pay X
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
um so you don't do you see incentives to
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
circumventing uh
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
where there's more angles to circumvent
 
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
where there's more angles to circumvent
this

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
um oh okay I see well that's a common
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
problem and it has that and um uh
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
understating income becoming unemployed
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh imputation of incomes our problems
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
common to uh many divorce and parenting
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
cases across the board this would uh not
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
stand out one way or the other uh you
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
know there are always questions with
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
financial affidavits and whether or not
 
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
parties are being forthright as to their
 
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
parties are being forthright as to their
income

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't think this has Effect one way
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and also can I just ask everyone to
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
slow down a little bit when they're
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
talking because the clerk is trying to
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
keep up with everything
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
um representative you have a question
 
01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
yes I do Madam chair thank you
 
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
for me it is difficult to understand
 
01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
um uh section 3B I think we're TR uh
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
since I don't have the background I
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
fortunately have never been involved in
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
the child support situation and uh if
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
someone attorney Markle for facts could
 
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
provide us with some background and also
 
01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:00.500 align:start position:0%
turn the attempt there to do uh
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
basically uh put down arithmetic in text
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
I think if it were presented offline as
 
01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:08.930 align:start position:0%
I think if it were presented offline as
uh

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
the arithmetic it would be easier for me
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
to understand thank you yes so so
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
attorney Mark Howe my thought was
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps you could put together some sort
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
of a diagram that explains how we have
 
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
the two thousand three thousand and how
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
it intersects and meets and comes up
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
with something if you could set up some
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a diagram for us and email us or
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
something I think that would be very
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
helpful okay be happy to do it sure I
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
can give you some examples of how the
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
calculation works is that what I'm I'm
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
is that what I'm hearing is what you're
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
okay I can do that
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much
 
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.580 align:start position:0%

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you turning mark

time so
 
01:11:19.729 --> 01:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%

up sign up earlier I will be very brief
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bill Woodbury I am an
 
01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
attorney practicing in the City of
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
Laconia I practice primarily in family
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
law uh but also in other areas and I'm
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
also the legislative chair for the New
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
suppose I'm we're speaking in opposition
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh to this bill I would Echo the
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
thoughts of
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
um attorney Mahoney uh with respect to
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh study of both 228 and 161
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
um that I would disagree with attorney
 
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
Markle uh respectfully uh that you know
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
this this bill would take the financial
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
incentive out of this we oppose because
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
we believe
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
um and I would Echo the thoughts of uh
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative altshuler that
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
um anytime you you try and fold into the
 
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.090 align:start position:0%
um anytime you you try and fold into the
calculation

01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:34.100 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
calculation
the

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
um the parenting time then you create an
 
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
incentive for people to fight for more
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
parenting time solely because it will
 
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
potentially cost them less money
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so I was asked to be brief and I will
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
be but that is our position in this that
 
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
this you know should never be folded
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
into the child support calculation it
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
creates a a
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
um an appropriate incentive I'll take
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
any questions people may have
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Woodbury
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I have a quick question but would you
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
agree that right now there's Financial
 
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
incentive that people go to bat fighting
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
left and right because they don't want
 
01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
to pay child support or they feel
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
they're paying too much so they they
 
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
tend to drag out the court cases for you
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
know longer periods of time to try to
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
get the more parenting time because they
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
think in their mind that it's going to
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh representative writes it is a it is a
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
battle that I fight on a daily basis
 
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
however right now there is no incentive
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
for someone to say I want more time
 
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
because I'll pay less
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
and that is why these bills shouldn't
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
okay I only took two clicks to unmute
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
this time thank you uh thank you thank
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%

understanding what this legislation will
 
01:14:17.159 --> 01:14:18.830 align:start position:0%
understanding what this legislation will
do

01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
um we've actually had a very public case
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
where uh a father was physically abusive
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
um to the mother
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
was caught being physically abusive and
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
subsequently charged uh with domestic
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
job because his
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
um abuse is now known and there is no
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
longer trust in him to
 
01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
do his job that he had because it
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
required public trust and there's bad
 
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
press around it because I'm trying to
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
kill your wife doesn't really you know
 
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
do a lot for your job prospects so now
 
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
he's underemployed
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
um where's the incentive for him to get
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
another kind of work or to get work at
 
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.570 align:start position:0%
another kind of work or to get work at
all

01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:16.580 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
while his wife is employed and
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
supporting those children what's the
 
01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
incentive under this statute if it were
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
to come to pass for him to go forward
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh I mean it in that particular
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
situation I mean there's a there's a
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
number of things occurring there and
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
there's a number of motivations that he
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
has to continue kind of maintaining this
 
01:15:46.689 --> 01:15:46.699 align:start position:0%
you know this uh negative behavior but
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
it the the problem specifically here is
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
that that a person who is voluntarily
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
underemployed uh voluntarily unemployed
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
um or who simply does not want to you
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
know pay more money has an incentive to
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
argue that they're that's in the best
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
interest of the children to have equal
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
parenting time between the parents
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
um where that incentive does not exist
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
now everything is based on income and
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
the reason being is that child support
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
the specific intent of Child Support is
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
to equilibrate the economic experience
 
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:23.540 align:start position:0%
between the households
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
and um in in the situation that you
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned and in in a myriad of other
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
situations an individual who's looking
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
to game the system by
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
um by you know creating in this case a
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption that equal
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
parenting time should reduce their child
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
support obligation that is the the
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
problem we see with this and in 161 we
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
would go again we would Echo the
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
comments of attorney Mahoney that this
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney wood Barry thank you
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
I see
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
one more person with their hand raised
 
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
in the
attendees

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
Christians we're almost out of time on
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
this so I can give you two minutes and
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
then to the John that raised his hand I
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
can give you two minutes but we are out
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
of time on this earring
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
so Kristen Smith
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for um taking my uh comment
 
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm Kristen Smith can you hear me
 
01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.649 align:start position:0%
um I'm Kristen Smith can you hear me
yeah

01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm Kristen Smith I was one of the
 
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
co-authors of the child support report
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so I would just encourage you to take
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
a look at
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the third recommendation which lays
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
out the um
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Shared Parenting
 
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.010 align:start position:0%
the Shared Parenting
um

01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
proposal I'm neutral on this bill I just
 
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
want that to be out there
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
um and if you want some examples of how
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
different earnings and different
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
scenarios of parenting time would
 
01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.050 align:start position:0%
scenarios of parenting time would
influence

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:05.060 align:start position:0%
influence
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill that's a good place
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
for you to look the other thing that I
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
would just point out is that the bill
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
does not stipulate how parenting time
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
will be calculated so when I read it I
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
did not see whether this would be
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
measured in overnights or whether this
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
would be measured in
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
um you know time spent with children
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
so that is an um oversight in the in the
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill as well as we also recommended
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
um that there needs to be exceptions
 
01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
when parenting time is addressed to
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
ensure appropriate safeguards are
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
included particularly in cases with
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
intimate partner violence to guarantee
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
safety for the child and the abused
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
parent so that um sort of comes back to
 
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
what a representative else Tyler was
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
just talking about
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to meet with committee
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
members if you have questions about the
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
report thank you
 
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
all right see you again thank you very
 
01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.350 align:start position:0%
all right see you again thank you very
much

01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
next is John
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
this John
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out there's no I
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
don't see a threshold for parenting time
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's based on the UNH
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
study which did have a threshold of 30
 
01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:42.590 align:start position:0%
study which did have a threshold of 30
percent

01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering why there's no
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
threshold in this bill
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
so here secondly why okay but but you
 
01:19:54.130 --> 01:19:54.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay last point I would recommend if uh
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
if this is past that the uh it would
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
start on April 1st
 
01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.750 align:start position:0%
start on April 1st
um

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
2022 that would coincide with a major
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
update to child support that the
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
division of
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
performs on April 1st every year
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
so that would eliminate two major
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.729 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions John can we get
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
I I've had trouble with my connection so
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard the entire meeting you
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
need your you need your
 
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:54.770 align:start position:0%
need your you need your
um

01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
your last name for the record
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's a b l a s
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.770 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for John
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:32.570 align:start position:0%
and that's
that's

01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
it all right so that's that's all we
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
have for Testimony so um we had two
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
sign-in supports six in opposition and
 
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
four that were neutral and so I'm
 
01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give the clerk a minute to

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind we're running a little
 
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.330 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind we're running a little
behind

01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.470 align:start position:0%
behind
okay

01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.450 align:start position:0%
okay
hello

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:45.530 align:start position:0%
hello
um

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
um

thank you
 
01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman and uh members of the
 
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.669 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman and uh members of the
committee

01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:22:57.130 --> 01:22:57.140 align:start position:0%
I'm here to present hb161
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
this bill was worked on for a
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time last session
 
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.990 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time last session
um as

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
um as
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
response to the 2018 child support
 
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
guidelines review
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
recommended that we do three things it
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
recommended that the New Hampshire child
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
support guidelines table be updated
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
it recommended that we
 
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:35.420 align:start position:0%
increase the self-support reserve from
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
115 percent to 120 of the national or of
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty line and it
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
suggested that we enact changes to the
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh to address shared
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
parenting and those three things are
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
it um the simplest thing is just
 
01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
changing the 115 to 120 for the federal
 
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
poverty line
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh the child support uh percentages
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh recommended by the review are in the
 
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:18.260 align:start position:0%
the actual report and the only addition
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
made to that was for a fourth child it
 
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.169 align:start position:0%
made to that was for a fourth child it
only

01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
did percentages up to three children and
 
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh the calculation was kind of followed
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
out to the fourth child and that is
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
included in the legislation
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
and then came
 
01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.770 align:start position:0%
and then came
the

01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
um recommendation that we address shared
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
parenting time and it recommended that
 
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
parenting time and it recommended that
we

01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier it recommended that
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
we set uh a floor for what is shared
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
parenting time so that the courts will
 
01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
know and it recommended 30 percent and
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it also
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
recommended that
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
when you have to
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
to households
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
um parenting
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
that the costs of maintaining those
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
households is higher than
 
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
one household and so it recommended that
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
you multiply the
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
um the amount of Child Support or the
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
amount required to support the child to
 
01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
be multiplied by 1.5 percent and that
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation is also
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
um added to the bill
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
and it also wanted uh
 
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
the change
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
for child support to be
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
based on how much time was given so if
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
you have 50 percent you'll get more
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
credit towards supporting your child
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
because when they're with with your um
 
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
with you then you are spending that
 
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
money uh to support the child
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
you get more credit if you have 50 than
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
if you had 40 and you get more if you
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
have 40 than if you have 30 whereas
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and so those calculations
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
are uh all included in this bill
 
01:26:24.659 --> 01:26:27.110 align:start position:0%
are uh all included in this bill
and

01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
I wanted to uh
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
help give
 
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
by

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
let's see I wanted to
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
share some information that
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
01:26:49.139 --> 01:26:50.750 align:start position:0%
you guys
were

01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
seeing in
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have the ability to
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
share on the screen
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
if there's some I'm pretty sure we do
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
is this sharing
 
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
yeah can you see this great
 
01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:08.810 align:start position:0%
yeah can you see this great
so

01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
so I can you see this uh scenario one on
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
can you see this I can yeah I can I can
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I have to check I'm not sure that
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
we were allowing
 
01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:27.950 align:start position:0%
we were allowing
um

01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
things to be shared on screen because
 
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
the only panelists can do it but the um
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
members of the public can't yeah well
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
this is an important part of the aspect
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
so that we address the issues
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
um of people being able to understand
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
how this this is
 
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
um you know it was just recommended that
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
we share
 
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
um in the last bill some examples so
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
that people would be able to follow the
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
logic so
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
I think this is important
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
um that we do
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
be able to see this so in this this
 
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
first scenario the people have the same
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh amount of
 
01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.669 align:start position:0%
uh amount of
income

01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
and the percentage of the child support
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
amount is based on that income and then
 
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
there is a credit which is and then that
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
amount is Multiplied because this is a
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
shared parenting formula or a shared
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
parenting situation uh it's multiplied
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
by the 1.5 percent and then
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
the person gets a credit for the amount
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
of time so in this situation they both
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
earn the same amount they both have the
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
child for the same amount of time and so
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's no obvious obligation required
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
whereas in scenario two
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
one the obligor earns more than the
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
obligee and it the amount of parenting
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
time is the same
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
but the obligation
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
is where the obligee or the obligorn
 
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
needs to pay the obligee uh an amount to
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
offset based on the amount of money that
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
they of the difference of the money uh
 
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
the obligor in this case earns 59
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
whereas the obligee earns 41 of the
 
01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
household income
 
01:29:29.699 --> 01:29:31.370 align:start position:0%
household income
and

01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
so in scenario three the there's a
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
difference of the credit there's a
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
difference in the earning from the
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
obligee and the obligor and there's a
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
difference in the parenting time it's
 
01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
only 40 percent instead of 50 and so you
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
can see that when you multiply the total
 
01:29:50.639 --> 01:29:52.850 align:start position:0%
can see that when you multiply the total
amount

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219 align:start position:0%
um the adjusted amount for for shared
 
01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
child support obligation
 
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
you multiply that by 40 and that is the
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
credit that that person gets towards
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
their obligation and so
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
there is an amount reflective of both
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
the difference in income and obviously
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
the difference in
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
um parenting time and so that is all
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
um show you guys have a copy of those
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
slides in your email
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
and um so I just wanted to give that
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
information so that you would um be able
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
to make a decision on this on this issue
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy uh so so another thing one
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
last thing that I wanted to point out
 
01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:44.219 align:start position:0%
was that in the recommendations from the
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
2018 child support guidelines I think
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
that uh it's important to point out that
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
the recommendation is that we adopt all
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations of the of the
 
01:30:58.610 --> 01:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
report and not just pick and choose
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
because that can have some negative
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
impacts and so this bill actually tries
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
all the recommendations and Implement
 
01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:08.990 align:start position:0%
all the recommendations and Implement
them

01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
um I thank you and uh happy to take
 
01:31:12.179 --> 01:31:19.550 align:start position:0%
um I thank you and uh happy to take
questions

01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.850 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.689 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I think I hadn't taken my hand
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
down from the last time sorry
 
01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:32.270 align:start position:0%
down from the last time sorry
okay

01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
um questions representative Bill answer
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative Ocala for for your
 
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
introduction in this bill
 
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:42.890 align:start position:0%
introduction in this bill
um

01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
I guess being new I'm a little kind of
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
confused between 161 and 228 are they
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're addressing the
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
parenting time but as is 228 so can you
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
yes I'm happy to I'm happy to help so um
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
228 the language firm that came out
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
before the report for the review
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines and so it does not
 
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
incorporate the recommendations it just
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
identified one of the problems in our
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
child support system and does not really
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
address the entire thing which 161 is
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
trying to do and is trying to implement
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
and so it's completely apples and
 
01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
oranges between the two even though it's
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
it's also personally trying to address
 
01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
the same it would pick up and work
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
session okay okay
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so that we can distinguish the the
 
01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.890 align:start position:0%
um so that we can distinguish the the
two

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:44.750 align:start position:0%
two
um

01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.810 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
representative

01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.370 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
30 or more of the time
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
is that two nights a week
 
01:32:59.450 --> 01:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
seven days
 
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
what what do you know what do you know
 
01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
what that is how much time or how much
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
overnights how many overnights that is
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
so it would be more it's it's um in
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
between it's more than two but less than
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
three so
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you had you know two nights
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
a week and then some other you know
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
rotating layers seven nights is a
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
hundred percent right okay thank you uh
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
and one other question
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
um the one and a half calculation wait
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
where how did that come about
 
01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
well it's it's recommended in the um
 
01:33:39.649 --> 01:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.629 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
okay

01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
Madam chair the the uh
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
is that can you just slow down a little
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
bit the questions are coming really fast
 
01:33:59.159 --> 01:34:01.930 align:start position:0%
bit the questions are coming really fast
okay

01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.770 --> 01:34:05.780 align:start position:0%
so if you want
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
the uh so I'm asking if um
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
the fact that you put these calculations
 
01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:16.430 align:start position:0%
the fact that you put these calculations
in

01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year can I get a
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement because I said I was
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
calculated for 30 but when I did my
 
01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
so this so this would be
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
um based on the plan that you create so
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
so it would be the plan would be
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
encompassing the whole year like maybe
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
you have weekends and holidays and stuff
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
like that that would be incorporated for
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
the whole year and so if there was a
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
change you would need to file for an
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
adjustment and prove that the change is
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know permanent et cetera et cetera
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
you know it wouldn't be just um you know
 
01:34:57.129 --> 01:34:57.139 align:start position:0%
a rebate
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
hey any other questions for
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative yopella
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
 
01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.610 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
so

01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
can can you explain how a hundred
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
percent of parenting time would be
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
identified if someone is visiting with
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
their kids seven days a week are we
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
um percentages of days in one week or
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
the number of days per month that
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
they're visiting with the child
 
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
neither it would be it would be based on
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
so they would
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
the calculation is based on overnights
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
which was recommended inside the
 
01:35:47.689 --> 01:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
guidelines and it is
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
the plan would be able to in Comfort
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
Compass an entire year so you would you
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
know you would say every other weekend
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
you know three weeks in the summer maybe
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
holidays et cetera et cetera and so all
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
of that will be stipulated and you would
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
find that calculation
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see any other questions
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.330 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative

like to say this bill
um

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh should be passed in um
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
I personally experienced
 
01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
um having to pay the full
 
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.169 align:start position:0%
um having to pay the full
um

01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
child support payment uh when I had
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
shared parenting and um
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
it really just negatively impacted
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
um you know my parenting time with the
 
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:23.930 align:start position:0%
um you know my parenting time with the
kids

01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
and it took a long time
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
um for it to get corrected but
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
I would just say uh this is something
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
um prevent other people
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
okay we'll go on to
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
um attorney Maryland who's the freaking
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for allowing me
 
01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
to testify I am testifying in opposition
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
um uh but oh but only for there are
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
certain specific
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
um Provisions that are are very
 
01:39:39.239 --> 01:39:41.629 align:start position:0%
um Provisions that are are very
concerning

01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
01:39:41.639 --> 01:39:42.310 align:start position:0%
concerning
um

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
the devil is in the details as they say
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
and so as I look at this bill
 
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
um the the biggest concern one of the
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
biggest concerns I have is in providing
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
a specific definition for Shared
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
Parenting the definition uh with this is
 
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:00.649 align:start position:0%
Parenting the definition uh with this is
right

01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:00.659 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
but the fourth line from the beginning
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the text of the bill
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
is that it is where the child overnights
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
with each parent 30 or more of the time
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
my first concern is by counting shared
 
01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
parenting as overnights
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't take much imagination to
 
01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
realize that over at night is the least
 
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
expensive time to have a child with you
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
the expenses arise during the day
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and taking children to their
 
01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:37.100 align:start position:0%
activities and providing them with food
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
overnights doesn't do that so I think
 
01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:42.659 align:start position:0%
using the the calculation of overnights
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
is deeply flawed
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
the deeper concern I have is with the 30
 
01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.110 align:start position:0%
the deeper concern I have is with the 30
percent

01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
30 percent of anything it is certainly
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
not shared if I have a pie and I eat
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of it and only leave you with
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
less than a third we haven't we've
 
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
shared it but I don't think we've done
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
it in a way that is in any way close to
 
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
being equal or approximately equal
 
01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
also the minute that you start to use a
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
specific percentage you drive up the
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
conflict in the parenting end of things
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
and suddenly the issue of who has the
 
01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
child an additional overnight
 
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
um becomes a huge factor and you create
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
conflict in the place that you least
 
01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
want it to be you may solve a problem
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
with child support but the parenting
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
issues relating to the child suddenly
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
become intensely
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
conflicted and and for all the wrong
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
reasons it becomes conflicted because of
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
um the money and not about what's in the
 
01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:51.020 align:start position:0%
best interest of the child
 
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
that phrase doesn't appear anywhere what
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the child
 
01:41:59.330 --> 01:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear anywhere in this bill
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to that issue I think that
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
you you should
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
at least remove that
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
the phrase equal or approximately equal
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
has been recognized and understood
 
01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.709 align:start position:0%
has been recognized and understood
without

01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
really any
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
um confusion as far as my experience has
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
been as to what that means and so
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
um you don't need that definition to be
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
replacing what the practice has been for
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
many many years
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
the other issue that I have is with the
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
repeal this is at the end of the bill a
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
repeal of RSA c51h1
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
that states that uh equal or
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
residential responsibilities in and of
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
itself shall not eliminate the need for
 
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
child support and shall not by itself
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
constitute ground for an adjustment
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's crucial language that is referred
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
to all the time and that language should
 
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
remain in the statute it should not be
 
01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:08.510 align:start position:0%
remain in the statute it should not be
repealed

01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
um I I have more concerns but I know the
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
time is short and I don't want to take
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
too much of your time so I urge the
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.450 align:start position:0%
committee to
um

01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
send this as well as 228 to interim
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
study there's a lot of Merit to this
 
01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:24.590 align:start position:0%
study there's a lot of Merit to this
bill

01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
as I said the devil's in those details
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
law thank you madam chair
 
01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
law thank you madam chair
um

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
so would language
 
01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
like in uh nothing is paragraph shall
 
01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:43.820 align:start position:0%
preclude a court for modification of the
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
presumptive child support orders such as
 
01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
Justice and the best interest of the
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
child may require suffice some of your
 
01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:52.970 align:start position:0%
child may require suffice some of your
concerns

01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
no not really because
 
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
75 to 80 percent if not more of cases
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
settle and so the arguments and the
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
conflict occurs much earlier than that
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.810 --> 01:44:22.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
up next is Brenda town and she has asked
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
um and thank you members of the
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee um I wanted again to speak in
 
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
01:44:43.609 --> 01:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
um as we are looking at this huge gap in
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
our current legislation we are having
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
parents faced with significant financial
 
01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:50.270 align:start position:0%
parents faced with significant financial
hardship

01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
it has been well studied that equal and
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
shared parenting time actually creates
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
the most healthy viable children short
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
of an intact marriage and what we're
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
finding is that we are as a state
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
adopting more and more uh shared
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
parenting but unfortunately our child
 
01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
support orders have not kept pace
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
and so we end up with one parent because
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
of the outcome of Silva V Silva bearing
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the entire financial burden
 
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
um of the child support while the other
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
parent is participating in full
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
parenting responsibility up to as much
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
as 50 of the time and yet gets no
 
01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
Financial relief in my role
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
um as a parent support Advocate I have
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
met parents that are struggling um to be
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
able to meet the needs of their kids
 
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
because compounding the matter is that
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
our DHHS policies around food stamps
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
child care and all the other state aid
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we provide low-income parents did
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
not keep Pace with the move to Shared
 
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
Parenting so typically that secondary
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
parent does not have access to those
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
benefits as well I'd like to point out
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
that HB 161 is a direct reflection of a
 
01:46:13.129 --> 01:46:13.139 align:start position:0%
very deep dive study that was done on
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of New Hampshire that study is
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
posted out on our DHHS website and is a
 
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
reflection of the direction our state
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
was committed to going into as an
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
outcome of that study and I really
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate Kristen Smith uh dialing in
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
today because she interviewed along with
 
01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
her research Partners thousands of
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
lawyers gals and judges in order to get
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
the outcome and there was a outcry by
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
our illegal system for standardized
 
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
calculations because it takes the
 
01:46:50.090 --> 01:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
mystery out in in it drops the level of
 
01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
contention on this very tricky area and
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
without contention on the front end we
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
create a better situation for our kids
 
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
because parents aren't fighting over
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
this stuff I'd like to point out this um
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
calculation has been in practice in
 
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
Vermont for over eight years
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
successfully this is not something new
 
01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
that we're wading into and the gaps that
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've historically struggled with which
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
include a lack of definition around what
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
shared parenting is a lack of definition
 
01:47:20.159 --> 01:47:22.070 align:start position:0%
shared parenting is a lack of definition
around

01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
um uh around this entire calculation
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
will be remedied with this bill in many
 
01:47:30.169 --> 01:47:30.179 align:start position:0%
many parents here in the state will be
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
removed from financial hardship it's the
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this committee to
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
bring forward legislation and not kick
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
out another round of study because we've
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
done that since 2005 and we really owe
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
it to our parents here in New Hampshire
 
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
to reconcile this situation once and for
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
all and I just speak for those kids who
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
are stuck in the middle and are really
 
01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
looking for us to step it up and match
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
what other states in this country have
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
easily been able to tackle so um again
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to answer any questions and
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
I thank you again for all listening and
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
your participation in this family
 
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
your participation in this family
committee

01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you uh it's
 
01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
called the great great testimony
 
01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
um now is Vermont solely on overnight
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
also yes they use this exact
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
prescription so when you know UNH did
 
01:48:28.850 --> 01:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
all of their work through the car seat
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
school they looked at Best Practices and
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
um this was a best practice that they
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
identified that met the gaps that our
 
01:48:42.169 --> 01:48:42.179 align:start position:0%
judges and our lawyers and our gals came
 
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
um the only other thing I'd like to add
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
that I didn't include in my testimony is
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
that last year when we were trying to
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
remedy the HB 362 issue
 
01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and it had been recommended to go out
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
to interim study I had an opportunity to
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
meet with our title 4D as well as judge
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
Ashley the assistant administrative
 
01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
judge in our family courts and both of
 
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
them endorsed getting to the
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
standardized calculation because it will
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
preclude a lot of the front and acrimony
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
that affects parenting so again thank
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
you guys very much
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
are there any further are there any
 
01:49:23.530 --> 01:49:23.540 align:start position:0%
further questions from this town
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
um Miss town just to kind of confirm are
 
01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
you saying that the judicial system
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
supports this bill I didn't quite
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
we did not have the exact draft of this
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill in front of them what I will tell
 
01:49:44.209 --> 01:49:44.219 align:start position:0%
you is that they were very um supportive
 
01:49:47.390 --> 01:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
of having a standardized calculation to
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
take the mystery out of shared parenting
 
01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
which they typically find is an issue
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
between Family Court judges using their
 
01:49:57.050 --> 01:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
own prescription
 
01:49:59.810 --> 01:49:59.820 align:start position:0%
um it has created a Great Divide
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
um because some judges uh rule One Way
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
some do rule another way and it creates
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
a challenge so um judge Ashley was very
 
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
supportive of getting to the
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
being none thank you very much thank you
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%

01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%

01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%

01:51:17.649 --> 01:51:17.659 align:start position:0%

I asked Derek Yates to raise his hand
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%

support to the parent parenting time you
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
risk people seeking parenting time only
 
01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
in an effort to reduce their child
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
support obligation which in an abusive
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
situation can put kids at risk and thank

certainly data that I can get to you
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I I there's some Court information

I'm sure that can be shared regarding
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
the percentage of cases involving
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
domestic violence sexual assault or
 
01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.330 align:start position:0%

01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
an example of a co-sponsor of this bill
 
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
and it's an example of constituent
 
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
Service uh you heard earlier from Brenda
 
01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
Town who is a neighbor and uh brought
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
this to my attention
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
and uh I I met with a representative
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
yakola and uh representative abrami
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
about this and also I wanted to point
 
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
out that over the past year another
 
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
member I think of this committee uh The
 
01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
Honorable skip Baron helped put some of
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
this together uh in what you're seeing
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
in this bill so it's uh and it's been
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
around a while uh it was again this is
 
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
my work on behalf of a constituent uh
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
that I felt was important to hear this
 
01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
is at the uh I'm laying this uh
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative and Ireland at the feet
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee to consider and work
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
through I don't have charts I don't have
 
01:55:06.649 --> 01:55:06.659 align:start position:0%
the detail that others do this has not
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
been an experience that I've ever
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
personally had to go through but I just
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to come in and say uh I'm
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
supporting uh Miss town and others on
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
the committee who've worked to bring
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
this forward before so uh thank you for
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
your time and uh hearing my uh case for
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
all right seeing them thank you very
 
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
up next is attorney Markle
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes good uh good uh good morning again
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me you have to be very
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
brief please okay real brief uh the
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
problems that I see with RS with the
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill are that if you want to
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
try to do an overhaul that's fine that
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
would go to study however just off the
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
top of my head given the fact that you
 
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
have about 60 to 70 percent of the uh
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
parties and cases are self-represented I
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
think the calculations may be difficult
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
to follow uh one thing the UNH study did
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
not do was examine the Practical
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
consequences of its recommendations not
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
in the copy that I saw uh the
 
01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts system had done things
 
01:56:27.649 --> 01:56:27.659 align:start position:0%
like percentages which other people have
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
already addressed they're not workable
 
01:56:29.699 --> 01:56:31.490 align:start position:0%
already addressed they're not workable
the

01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't think they're workable as was
 
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned uh what they do is
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
they focus on the fighting and the child
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
support and that drives the attempt on
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
um the final thing I think that was not
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned was two things number one is
 
01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:49.490 align:start position:0%
mentioned was two things number one is
that

01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you may be opening floodgates with
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
this in terms of pro seis not
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
understanding this approach to Shared
 
01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
Parenting because if you have
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
percentages I can right now see the
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
modifications I can see the contempts
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I can see requests for reimbursement
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
because percentages weren't met for a
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
given month day or year and I can see
 
01:57:11.209 --> 01:57:11.219 align:start position:0%
the courts being clogged with this from
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
Pro seis uh and finally which also
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
should be recognized is is that none of
 
01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh is that
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
um I think when you look at the
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
parenting rights and responsibilities
 
01:57:26.930 --> 01:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
act I think it's RSA 461a14 I think you
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
suppose the courts are still free to use
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
child support in a manner which is most
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
conducive to the child's benefit okay
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
which is the overriding concern so uh
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's kind of it in a nutshell
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
um I look forward to further submissions
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
and I thank the committee first time
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
 
01:57:45.179 --> 01:57:49.370 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney

assistants we share those concerns
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
there's a phrase that stuck out in my
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
mind that I learned from working with
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
attorneys is criminal law brings out the
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
best in people Sammy law brings out the
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
worst in people it's a sad reality and
 
01:58:53.689 --> 01:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to work with the
 
01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you very much and then
 
01:59:17.089 --> 01:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
the last person testifying is Kristen
 
01:59:17.099 --> 01:59:18.350 align:start position:0%
the last person testifying is Kristen
Smith

01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
you just need to unmute yeah so it just
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
took me a minute to find
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
um so I just um I'm sorry when I
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
testified earlier I thought we were
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
um Hospital 161 I came in at 10 30. so
 
01:59:42.290 --> 01:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
the comments that I made for I guess it
 
01:59:45.609 --> 01:59:45.619 align:start position:0%
was Hospital 228 were in reference to
 
01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
um which is
 
01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:50.510 align:start position:0%
um which is
um

01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.890 align:start position:0%
um
basically

01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:53.270 align:start position:0%
basically
um

01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
having uh
 
01:59:58.370 --> 01:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
I I do see now that there is uh that
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
overnights is in the bill so I apologize
 
02:00:03.649 --> 02:00:03.659 align:start position:0%
for for missing that um but just not
 
02:00:14.089 --> 02:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
Ms Smith are you there
 
02:00:18.649 --> 02:00:18.659 align:start position:0%
I think she may have accidentally gotten
 
02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
bounced hold on here she comes
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
and Sam Smith are you there
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
oh I apologize I'm not sure how that
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
went from
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
unmuted to muted
 
02:00:35.159 --> 02:00:36.109 align:start position:0%
unmuted to muted
um

02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
I was just saying that my comments
 
02:00:40.609 --> 02:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
earlier were really in reference to
 
02:00:45.290 --> 02:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 161 I didn't realize that um
 
02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
we were you were talking about a
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
different bill so I apologize for
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
jumping in then
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I do want to just
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to in the report is
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
that 63 of the case of the child support
 
02:01:00.599 --> 02:01:02.270 align:start position:0%
that 63 of the case of the child support
cases

02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
um the the judges when they're
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
um when they're working through the
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
child support cases
 
02:01:13.129 --> 02:01:13.139 align:start position:0%
um 63 deviate from the child support
 
02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines and so
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
um we were asked
 
02:01:22.250 --> 02:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
um at UNH to look at the child support
 
02:01:26.689 --> 02:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
system and we were asked to look at what
 
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
a feasible
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
um shared parenting program would look
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
like and so we looked into what other
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
states have done and looked at Best
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
Practices and put forward this proposal
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier I'm neutral on this
 
02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.729 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier I'm neutral on this
bill

02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:46.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:01:49.129 --> 02:01:49.139 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
02:01:52.129 --> 02:01:52.139 align:start position:0%
the The Proposal that we put forward
 
02:01:55.070 --> 02:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
which looks like is well represented in
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is based on the research from
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
other states from what other states are
 
02:02:02.159 --> 02:02:03.410 align:start position:0%
other states from what other states are
doing

02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
um so the one exception that I would
 
02:02:06.239 --> 02:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
um so the one exception that I would
um

02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
would um like to just bring your
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
attention to is
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
um cases with intimate partner violence
 
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
and domestic abuse do need to have a
 
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
consideration and other other states are
 
02:02:26.689 --> 02:02:26.699 align:start position:0%
doing that there's other people who have
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
spoken today who are better equipped to
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
give guidance on what that would look
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
like than I am but it is
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
um a provision that is in other states
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and would be
 
02:02:46.609 --> 02:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
um a really good safeguard for those
 
02:02:46.619 --> 02:02:48.350 align:start position:0%
um a really good safeguard for those
situations

02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
um again I'm happy to talk about the
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
report with people who have questions on
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%

02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and uh fellow
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
representatives for the record I am
 
02:05:14.089 --> 02:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative Al baldos Rockingham
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
County District 5 testifying from an
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
undisclosed location
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh I brought this bill forward uh HB 317
 
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
uh to correct a major problem within the
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
state a few years ago I brought this
 
02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill forward and we were told by the
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justice lobbyists that the
 
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire does not go after
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
veterans disability uh they leave it
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
alone and I so the bill ended up dying
 
02:05:44.209 --> 02:05:44.219 align:start position:0%
and I agreed with them because when I
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
got a divorce my disability was not
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
touched of course I got custody of my
 
02:05:51.649 --> 02:05:51.659 align:start position:0%
daughter uh as I was a single father for
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
a while so it didn't affect me but I did
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
bring the federal law into court now we
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
have many veterans in the state of New
 
02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have called me and
 
02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
complained about uh they're using their
 
02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
disability some is causing homeless some
 
02:06:08.450 --> 02:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
of the cases I'm here and cause suicide
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
on the veterans on putting them out in
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
the street
 
02:06:12.119 --> 02:06:12.709 align:start position:0%
the street
um

02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
we try to get this corrected last time
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and then of course it went into
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
interstudy and um some of the veterans
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
that wanted to testify had problems on
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
were to zoom on their phones in their
 
02:06:27.169 --> 02:06:27.179 align:start position:0%
car and other stuff there so I'm hoping
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh there are quite a few that are on
 
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
this here now let me go where I'm going
 
02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
with this here this kid
 
02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
um disability veterans disability which
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm disabled veteran it affects many
 
02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
many families and the reason why it does
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
male and female have the same problem so
 
02:06:48.109 --> 02:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
this and it always is who ends up with
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
the children because no matter what
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
happens in the court somebody's not
 
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:53.330 align:start position:0%
happens in the court somebody's not
happy

02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
happy
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government for many years
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
came out with the law saying that there
 
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
is what's called apportionment in uh
 
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
during the divorce that the um courts on
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the individuals are required to write
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
to the VA and they make the decision on
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
apportionments on how much money will
 
02:07:14.689 --> 02:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
actually go to the dependents now
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's different stages in this here
 
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
whether you're retired because if you're
 
02:07:22.250 --> 02:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
retired like myself uh then a certain
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
portion of my retirement go uh would go
 
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
to the ex-wife there or whatever same
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
thing uh vice versa disability in your
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
disability uh which is not a marital
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
asset is there's a certain portion in
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
there that is divided uh to the
 
02:07:41.330 --> 02:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
apportionment that will go to dependence
 
02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
but my main thing here is to make sure
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we correct the formula and tell the
 
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
judges to comply with federal law and
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
not to use their disability money
 
02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:54.229 align:start position:0%
not to use their disability money
for

02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
um you know child support and let the VA
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
decide on this per the federal law and
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
like I said you're probably going to get
 
02:08:04.129 --> 02:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
some testimony today for male and female
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
onto a divorce and I know after being
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
married three times that sometimes
 
02:08:12.890 --> 02:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
children are used as pawns and nobody's
 
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
ever happy what you know on how much
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
money that they get
 
02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
so um you know and they always want more
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't blame them you know veterans
 
02:08:23.689 --> 02:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
want to take care of their children
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh and that's very important especially
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
me as a father of seven children I
 
02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
understand and paid my dues and educated
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
my children so I can understand where
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
some veterans are coming from and we do
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
have our five percent that they have to
 
02:08:39.169 --> 02:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
fight with in order to make sure that
 
02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
they support their children just like
 
02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else but this hair is a
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
no-brainer here you know to make sure
 
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire complies
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
with the uh federal law and I'm going to
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
stop right there because you're going to
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
get more testimony from the veterans in
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire today some are probably
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
homeless living out of their cars and
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
other ones have gone through this air
 
02:09:01.729 --> 02:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
and gone to the Supreme Court and they
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
can explain better to you than what I
 
02:09:06.169 --> 02:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
can so therefore I'll stop right now and
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'll take whatever questions you have
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative baldosaro so I
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
have a question could you kindly send to
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
the committee the federal lawyer talking
 
02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:19.669 align:start position:0%
the committee the federal lawyer talking
about

02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
uh yes it's actually in the bill
 
02:09:23.219 --> 02:09:25.189 align:start position:0%
uh yes it's actually in the bill
um

02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:30.010 --> 02:09:30.020 align:start position:0%
the entire Federal expression
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah what I can do is uh Sean bronstein
 
02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
is going to be speaking uh he probably
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
has the federal law right there in front
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
of him I'm actually not at my home I'm
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
in another location uh and I could
 
02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
probably try to search for it and send
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
it but I'm sure Sean has it right at his
 
02:09:52.370 --> 02:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
fingertips okay thank you thank you I
 
02:09:53.930 --> 02:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward on behalf of
 
02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
you know the many veterans that's the
 
02:09:57.290 --> 02:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
reason right
 
02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know I I believe that we all want to
 
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
support veterans and I think we all want
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
to support children in need you know and
 
02:10:24.410 --> 02:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
when I look at this legislation it seems
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
that veterans and their children are
 
02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
struggling over the same limited dollars
 
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
and personally I think that is a sad
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
commentary on how we treat veterans and
 
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
children in need do you know of any
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
other proposals or legislation out there
 
02:10:45.609 --> 02:10:45.619 align:start position:0%
by which we can actually increase
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
benefits to Veterans rather than to take
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
from their dependent children
 
02:10:56.330 --> 02:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
well it's this is a federal issue uh you
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
know the state has really has no law of
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
a silent on it and the federal law base
 
02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
says you know it's not a marital asset I
 
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
wish there was a better answer there I
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
know we were fortunate in the last
 
02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
president because it took over 40 years
 
02:11:13.850 --> 02:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
to finally get uh veterans in New
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't have a full service
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
hospital to get
 
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
treated by the best doctors in the
 
02:11:19.380 --> 02:11:20.149 align:start position:0%
treated by the best doctors in the
community

02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
you know and like myself I use Dana Faba
 
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
document and other operations that I've
 
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
had within the last nine months here in
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
cancer and throat operations so
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's a great question it's
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
something that we have to fight our two
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
senators in Congressman to push in the
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative balthazaro
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%

up next is beyond
brookshaw

02:11:55.850 --> 02:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
brookshaw
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
to speak in support I can give you two
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
minutes I know you asked for seven but
 
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of people that want to
 
02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:04.910 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of people that want to
testify

02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:22.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:22.689 --> 02:12:22.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
next is um attorney Mahoney
 
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much good morning
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
um I I am speaking in opposition to this
 
02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:42.050 align:start position:0%
um I I am speaking in opposition to this
bill

02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
well I have nothing but complete
 
02:12:47.689 --> 02:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
admiration for our veterans and I agree
 
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
with attorney long that they should or
 
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
attorney petrine I mean representative
 
02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
Petrino that they should probably be
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
receiving better benefits than what they
 
02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:56.689 align:start position:0%
receiving better benefits than what they
are

02:12:56.689 --> 02:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:58.970 --> 02:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is the entire
 
02:13:01.490 --> 02:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
family of a disabled veteran is impacted
 
02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:02.390 align:start position:0%
family of a disabled veteran is impacted
by

02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
their disability
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
and a veteran receives enhanced benefits
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
because it he or she has dependents
 
02:13:13.689 --> 02:13:13.699 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
basis in any law that says that the
 
02:13:19.729 --> 02:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran doesn't have an
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
obligation to support his family
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
or her family the
 
02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
or her family the
um

02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:29.209 --> 02:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
confusion I think sometimes arises and
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
it's important for the committee to
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a distinction
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
between treating disability veterans
 
02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
disability benefits as an asset
 
02:13:42.050 --> 02:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
and as a source of support
 
02:13:44.589 --> 02:13:44.599 align:start position:0%
as an asset the law is very clear
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
disability benefits veterans disability
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
benefits are not to be included in the
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
marital estate when dividing assets at
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
the time of a divorce off limits no
 
02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.390 align:start position:0%
the time of a divorce off limits no
question

02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
but the law is also equally clear that
 
02:14:02.330 --> 02:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
that is that disability benefit is a
 
02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:05.099 align:start position:0%
financial resource to that disabled
 
02:14:05.099 --> 02:14:06.229 align:start position:0%
financial resource to that disabled
veteran

02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
if the disabled veteran is a low income
 
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
if that disability is the only financial
 
02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:14.390 align:start position:0%
if that disability is the only financial
resource

02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
resource
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
he or she has then that is clearly taken
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
into account in the calculation of the
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
on the guidelines a very low income
 
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
individual has a maximum
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
um support obligation of fifty dollars a
 
02:14:28.199 --> 02:14:29.450 align:start position:0%
um support obligation of fifty dollars a
month

02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:31.010 align:start position:0%
month
however

02:14:31.010 --> 02:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:14:35.450 --> 02:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
many disabled veterans are able to work
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
um but they may not be working as much
 
02:14:40.569 --> 02:14:40.579 align:start position:0%
as they would if they weren't disabled
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
that impact on on a disabled veteran
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
also impacts his or her family
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the veteran disability is there to
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
not only
 
02:14:57.169 --> 02:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
provide financial support to the veteran
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
but also to his or her dependents that
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
is very clear and has been clearly
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
stated when this very issue came before
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court in a
 
02:15:09.649 --> 02:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
case of Rose versus Rose
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I can give you the site if you need
 
02:15:13.850 --> 02:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
that I'll I can look that up for you but
 
02:15:16.850 --> 02:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
there has been a clear
 
02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:18.250 align:start position:0%
there has been a clear
um

02:15:18.250 --> 02:15:18.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
precedent in the law in the federal law
 
02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
that veterans benefits
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
are available for the calculation of
 
02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
that veterans uh this I have to remember
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
to say disabled veterans benefits not
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
just veterans benefits but disabled
 
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
veterans benefits are available for
 
02:15:40.129 --> 02:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
calculation in determining a disabled
 
02:15:44.649 --> 02:15:44.659 align:start position:0%
vets support to his or her family
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
so I urge the committee to
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
um not
 
02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair so attorney the um
 
02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
so if if a disabled veteran was to get a
 
02:16:09.890 --> 02:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
compensation and I'm looking at the
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
calculations here of twelve hundred
 
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
dollars for a child
 
02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
um if this bill passed that compensation
 
02:16:20.569 --> 02:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be included
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you that's yeah I
 
02:16:26.450 --> 02:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
just wanted to confirm that thank you
 
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:30.380 align:start position:0%
attorney Mahoney
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%

thanks so much
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%

02:16:52.019 --> 02:16:52.549 align:start position:0%
okay thank you good morning
um

02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'm the ex-wave of Sean bronstein and
 
02:16:57.049 --> 02:16:57.059 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that he is one of
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
the authors of the spell and I just
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
learned about this bill last week but it
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
appears that he's been working on it for
 
02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
quite some time now unfortunately Sean
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I had a very lengthy and contentious
 
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
divorce process which took years to
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
complete it ended with him appealing all
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
the way to the U.S Supreme Court which
 
02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:17.460 align:start position:0%
declined to review his appeal the
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
primary driver behind this appeal
 
02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
process was because he vehemently did
 
02:17:22.969 --> 02:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
not want to pay me the child support
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
that Family Court granted me I'm here
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
today to express to you my strong
 
02:17:30.889 --> 02:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
concern in opposition to this bill and
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
it is my hope it will not be passed I
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
have nothing but great appreciation and
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
respect for all of our military men and
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
women especially our disabled veterans
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
and I feel that they are rightly
 
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
entitled to the many benefits and
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
programs that are offered to them in my
 
02:17:48.049 --> 02:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
eyes the bill in question today does not
 
02:17:50.570 --> 02:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
make sense child support is granted for
 
02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
a reason so there's Equity between both
 
02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the child's homes insinuating that
 
02:17:57.290 --> 02:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
the ex of a disabled veteran should
 
02:17:59.330 --> 02:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
forego child support despite being
 
02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
granted to the ex from a judge feels
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
unethical for instance if if this bill
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
were to pass it is likely I would lose
 
02:18:09.889 --> 02:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
my child support entirely which I rely
 
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
on to provide for my daughter who will
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
make up that difference in my situation
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
it has been explained to me I should
 
02:18:19.490 --> 02:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
TANF money or other benefits granted by
 
02:18:21.290 --> 02:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
the state which means the shortfall
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
created by not receiving child support
 
02:18:25.849 --> 02:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
would become a burden of the taxpayers
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
and not the person who helped bring my
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
child into the world
 
02:18:31.969 --> 02:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
in my case Sean receives a specific
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
benefit Social Security survivors
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from my daughter of about a
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars monthly and that money
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
is no longer split between the parents
 
02:18:41.650 --> 02:18:41.660 align:start position:0%
when they divorce in New Hampshire
 
02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
however when I apply for state benefits
 
02:18:47.209 --> 02:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
through DHHS they include the entire
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
amount of that thousand dollars benefit
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
because they say it follows the child
 
02:18:54.049 --> 02:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that it has already
 
02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:56.099 align:start position:0%
been calculated in my child support
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
payment from from Sean this means that I
 
02:19:02.690 --> 02:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
qualify for fewer benefits as it is with
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 317 it would mean none of
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
Sean's income would be considered when
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
calculating child support yet twelve
 
02:19:12.169 --> 02:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of income paid to him
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
for our daughter counts against me when
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
applying for benefits
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
think of how many people would be
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
impacted drastically by passing HB 317
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
and also think of who anyone who splits
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
custody with a disabled vet and makes
 
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
less annually than the vet would be
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted that means at a
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
minimum the most vulnerable would stand
 
02:19:35.929 --> 02:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
to lose the most I would be one of those
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
people I have full-time steady work and
 
02:19:41.330 --> 02:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
Sean's income as a disabled veteran is
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
more than double what mine is he lives
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the house that we bought together a
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
large home in a cul-de-sac neighborhood
 
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
and by contrast I live in a small second
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
floor two-bedroom apartment there are
 
02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
already great disparities between our
 
02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
daughters two homes without continued
 
02:19:58.849 --> 02:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
child support the disparities would
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
increase further and be potentially
 
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
devastating for my daughter as I may not
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
be able to afford what little I have I
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
believe there may be other programs or
 
02:20:09.469 --> 02:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
bills that would benefit disabled
 
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
veterans without encumbering the
 
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or hurting those of us single
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
parents trying to raise two small
 
02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
children if us this bill has the ability
 
02:20:20.330 --> 02:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
to potentially negatively impact
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of children in much the same
 
02:20:24.889 --> 02:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
way as my daughter thank you very much
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%

02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:32.389 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative hold on hold on I wasn't
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
calling you
 
02:20:53.870 --> 02:20:53.880 align:start position:0%

02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
Matthew okay he's not here go ahead
 
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative Graham thank you madam
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
chair for the record I am representative
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
John Graham and I represent Hillsborough
 
02:21:10.450 --> 02:21:10.460 align:start position:0%
district 7 which is the town of Bedford
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
as a military veteran and one who
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
receives uh disability compensation from
 
02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
the VA I oppose this bill
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
let's begin by looking at what uh
 
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
veterans disability compensation is it
 
02:21:27.050 --> 02:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
is a monetary payment for injuries
 
02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
suffered as a result of military service
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
depending upon the severity the VA
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
assigns a
 
02:21:38.809 --> 02:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
um a rating in 10 10 increments from 10
 
02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
to 100 percent
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
each of these has a different monetary
 
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
value and in my written testimony I did
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
provide a break out of what those
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
um were at each of the levels
 
02:21:55.250 --> 02:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
but at no matter which level the payment
 
02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
is exempt from federal income tax
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
thus at a hundred percent level the
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
veteran will be receiving over three
 
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
thousand a month
 
02:22:08.330 --> 02:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
and it is tax-free and at that level the
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
veteran is eligible to have all of his
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
medical expenses including Dental
 
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
and they're showing at the tables at the
 
02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:20.990 align:start position:0%
and they're showing at the tables at the
end

02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
end
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
for each eligible child the veteran
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
receives an additional amount of money
 
02:22:28.969 --> 02:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
to representative Long's comment earlier
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
on that one chart where it shows for
 
02:22:33.290 --> 02:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
example twelve hundred dollars that is
 
02:22:37.210 --> 02:22:37.220 align:start position:0%
not all just for the child it is part of
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the overall package
 
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
I would also like to point out that
 
02:22:44.210 --> 02:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's a problem in paragraph two of
 
02:22:47.330 --> 02:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically a statement unless
 
02:22:49.130 --> 02:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
the veteran has waived a portion of
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
retirement pay in order to receive such
 
02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:53.929 align:start position:0%
retirement pay in order to receive such
compensation

02:22:53.929 --> 02:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
this refers to an ongoing policy that
 
02:22:59.690 --> 02:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
reduces a member's service member's
 
02:23:02.889 --> 02:23:02.899 align:start position:0%
retirement pay dollar for dollar
 
02:23:07.730 --> 02:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
if he receives the VA disability pay
 
02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
thus my disability of 400 a month comes
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
directly out of my retirement pay
 
02:23:17.330 --> 02:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
however the law was recently changed so
 
02:23:20.210 --> 02:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
if you're 50 or more which are the
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
higher levels that we're talking about
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
um you receive both your military
 
02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
retirement pay and the full compensation
 
02:23:29.929 --> 02:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
from the VA
 
02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
but what I'd like to stress here is that
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
um the higher the VA ratings we are
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
potentially talking thousands a month
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
and as a
 
02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
veteran and as
 
02:23:46.490 --> 02:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
um representative baldusaro said earlier
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
we all want to support our children I
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
think that we ought to continue along
 
02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
the path
 
02:23:54.410 --> 02:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
um that we currently have where it is
 
02:23:56.809 --> 02:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
considered uh I know that one of the
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
previous speakers mentioned Roe Rose
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
versus Rose under the Supreme Court I
 
02:24:05.090 --> 02:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
did provide you all with the synopsis of
 
02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
that and I would ask that you read that
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
before making any judgments with that I
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
hope I kept it under two minutes Madam
 
02:24:15.889 --> 02:24:15.899 align:start position:0%

02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%

Madam chair yes I oh definitely not that
 
02:26:54.889 --> 02:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
was like a
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
that was like the biggest misstatement
 
02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
ever anyway thank you very much Madam
 
02:26:58.500 --> 02:26:59.210 align:start position:0%

chair

02:26:59.210 --> 02:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:26:59.220 --> 02:26:59.870 align:start position:0%
chair
um

02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:27:03.410 --> 02:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
actually miss Angelini and attorney
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
Mahoney and John Graham made a lot of
 
02:27:07.370 --> 02:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
the same points I made in my uh written
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
testimony or they did a lot more
 
02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
eloquently than I could um and just as
 
02:27:14.090 --> 02:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
problems or even noticed this is an
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
exact repeat of HB 1716 which came up
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
last year was one of the first all
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
virtual bills the hearing executive
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
session took place entirely on Zoom but
 
02:27:26.450 --> 02:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
it uh never got a floor vote you know
 
02:27:28.190 --> 02:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
there's some strange stuff happen on the
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
floor but it probably could have been
 
02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
and it would have just been an interim
 
02:27:34.610 --> 02:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
study bill anyway and it was inspired by
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
a her case of Sean bronstein and Jessica
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
bronstein who's the same person as
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
Jessica Jerica Angelini who just heard
 
02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
from a few minutes ago and I um
 
02:27:46.250 --> 02:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
I could provide a copy of the court case
 
02:27:48.889 --> 02:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
in case you you in case you uh in case
 
02:27:51.530 --> 02:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
you need it so he he lost that case and
 
02:27:54.410 --> 02:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Angelini well it's nobody ever
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
wins a family law case but she you know
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
she she was on the prevailing side
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:28:05.690 --> 02:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
whenever the facts we've already covered
 
02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
the facts of the case um
 
02:28:10.130 --> 02:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
Mr Brownstein and some of the other
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
Witnesses in the previous case uh put
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
some child support worksheets in the uh
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
permanent Bill files and um I I looked
 
02:28:19.250 --> 02:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
at those I actually feel a bit
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable that
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's some identifying information
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
that wasn't reacted from all protected
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
from all the sheets and Mr Bronstein's
 
02:28:28.429 --> 02:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
case he he blanked out his daughter's
 
02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
name but not her
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
birth date but um that's something we'll
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
have to think about especially now that
 
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
the bill files are like more accessible
 
02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
than they used to be
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
um and um he argued that his veterans
 
02:28:40.319 --> 02:28:41.510 align:start position:0%
um and um he argued that his veterans
disabilities

02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
benefits should have been left out of
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
the child support calculations I I moved
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
the opinion as is the Supreme Court and
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
others that um
 
02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
they should be should be included in
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
fact the disability uh program uh
 
02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
specifically supports not just the
 
02:29:00.889 --> 02:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
veteran himself or herself and but um
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh the families as well and um
 
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
and also so like you know in child
 
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
support you are supporting a family
 
02:29:11.929 --> 02:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
member you know you you and um
 
02:29:14.990 --> 02:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
then there's Us in Boulder sorrow uh
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
let's well one more time about last time
 
02:29:18.889 --> 02:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
but more so this time we already just
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
built victimizes veterans but actually
 
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
veterans are both sides of the child
 
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
support equation there's many uh
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
especially female veterans who are back
 
02:29:28.429 --> 02:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
receiving child support and deserve to
 
02:29:31.550 --> 02:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
receive uh child support and even though
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
veterans do have a higher incident of uh
 
02:29:37.130 --> 02:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
mental health issues um
 
02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:29:41.570 --> 02:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily uh
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
in other ways other ways they actually
 
02:29:45.050 --> 02:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
do better than most members of society
 
02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
simply because you know they're they're
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have a volunteer military with a you
 
02:29:51.290 --> 02:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
know high standards for who who gets in
 
02:29:54.290 --> 02:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
and then um and also military service
 
02:29:56.570 --> 02:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
you learn a lot from that although I
 
02:29:58.969 --> 02:29:58.979 align:start position:0%
should like and myself I'm either a
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
veteran nor a uh nor have I been through
 
02:30:04.250 --> 02:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
a child custody case I want divorce I
 
02:30:05.450 --> 02:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
went through we had no children or
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
anything that much to fight about but
 
02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:09.110 align:start position:0%
anything that much to fight about but
um

02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
so anyway I'm in opposition to Bill and
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh the federal law a question I believe
 
02:30:16.730 --> 02:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
is 45
 
02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:18.230 align:start position:0%
is 45
uh

02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:21.969 --> 02:30:21.979 align:start position:0%
45 CS CFR paragraph
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
302.56 and that's there's also reference
 
02:30:26.929 --> 02:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
to that in the bill and also uh if you
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
get a copy of bronstein versus
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
Bronstein's decision that mentioned it
 
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
there they um the Supreme Court it was a
 
02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:34.670 align:start position:0%
there they um the Supreme Court it was a
rather

02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
rather
 
02:30:38.210 --> 02:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
they were they had it was a rather uh
 
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
scathing it's rather skating decision so
 
02:30:42.770 --> 02:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
they cited many many precedents this is
 
02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
a anyway the veterans disabilities
 
02:30:46.849 --> 02:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
get back to the main point the veteran
 
02:30:46.859 --> 02:30:47.929 align:start position:0%
get back to the main point the veteran
disabilities

02:30:47.929 --> 02:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
um our earnings and income so they are
 
02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
something that the uh
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
parent you jump to wrap it up
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative okay so anyway I'm I'm
 
02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
gonna post this bill I think the federal
 
02:31:02.210 --> 02:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
law actually uh requires us to count
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
those uh disability benefits because it
 
02:31:06.530 --> 02:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
says all earnings and income and
 
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh benefits our income and
 
02:31:11.809 --> 02:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
also I think I probably forgot the
 
02:31:13.730 --> 02:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
formerly statement record I'm president
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan I represent Stratford
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
County district 6 Thurman Matt Berry and
 
02:31:19.849 --> 02:31:19.859 align:start position:0%
I'm in opposition to this bill and I did
 
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
send in um it's in some written
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'd be happy to send in a
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
copy of the bronstein case in case you
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
don't get it from some other source and
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that's it I mean I'd be happy asking
 
02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
any questions but you probably want to
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh move on and hear from the other
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
Witnesses so
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:42.410 --> 02:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
02:31:45.469 --> 02:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you and it's
 
02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
anticlimatic but thanks thank you
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.290 --> 02:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
hi everybody
 
02:31:57.300 --> 02:31:58.429 align:start position:0%
hi everybody
um

02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
my name is Christopher Cianci and um I
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
am a disabled veteran and I just think
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
this bill uh needs to be passed it's
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
important that it is passed uh veterans
 
02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh who are disabled receive benefits and
 
02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
um it's up to the VA uh what benefit
 
02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
amount that may or may not be and
 
02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
um they've issued the im9803 which is
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
the apportionment process
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
for state courts to follow and it's just
 
02:32:30.530 --> 02:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
important that that process is followed
 
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:32.630 align:start position:0%
so that
um

02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
benefits that veterans receive are
 
02:32:37.610 --> 02:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
accurately distributed and that's what
 
02:32:40.849 --> 02:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
that process has been set up for is for
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the benefits to go directly from the
 
02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
VA to whatever beneficiary is receiving
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
the benefit and so I just think that
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is important to pass
 
02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say today
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for Mr
 
02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:59.270 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for Mr
Cianci

02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:04.090 --> 02:33:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.330 --> 02:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:20.750 --> 02:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay next we'll go to Brenda town
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me
 
02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you very much
 
02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today again just to speak in
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and my role as a
 
02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
parent advocate
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I had my first face-to-face session
 
02:33:41.690 --> 02:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
with parents of New Hampshire 40 parents
 
02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
showed up and in the course of meeting
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
them all 20 of them I recognized were
 
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
homeless and of the homeless population
 
02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
um 18 of them were veterans when I dug
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
into this issue what I found is that
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
they were disabled veterans and it had
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
their child support taken from their
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
disability pay which was the sole um uh
 
02:34:05.570 --> 02:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
source of their income I want to say
 
02:34:08.450 --> 02:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
that veterans do in fact uh want to
 
02:34:10.010 --> 02:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
support their children and these
 
02:34:13.370 --> 02:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
veterans did unfortunately the
 
02:34:15.849 --> 02:34:15.859 align:start position:0%
compensation that the VA gives a veteran
 
02:34:19.370 --> 02:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
is a relatively small versus the child
 
02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
support calculation that the state of
 
02:34:24.650 --> 02:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh grants for instance in
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
one case that I'm familiar with the the
 
02:34:30.530 --> 02:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
state gave 39 a child for four children
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
sorry that was the Veterans
 
02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
Administration gave that to the parent a
 
02:34:36.170 --> 02:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
total of a hundred and thirty dollars
 
02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
and the state removed twelve hundred
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
dollars from the veterans disability
 
02:34:43.250 --> 02:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
leaving him incapable of supporting
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
himself with that being said there is a
 
02:34:49.490 --> 02:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
very discreet process Associated or for
 
02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
veterans uh disability to be granted to
 
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
the obligee parent and that is tied to
 
02:34:58.969 --> 02:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
what the secretary of the veteran
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
administration has put in place it's per
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
USC 511 and what should happen is the
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has no visibility
 
02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
into the issues that a suffering veteran
 
02:35:11.929 --> 02:35:11.939 align:start position:0%
is dealing with he could be dealing with
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
huge medical costs prescriptions all
 
02:35:17.809 --> 02:35:17.819 align:start position:0%
kinds of other expenses in order to be
 
02:35:20.270 --> 02:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
able to maintain his health because this
 
02:35:22.010 --> 02:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
compensation is granted because of
 
02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:23.750 align:start position:0%
compensation is granted because of
injury

02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
injury
 
02:35:25.610 --> 02:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
um what the Veterans Administration does
 
02:35:27.650 --> 02:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
is it offers an apportionment process
 
02:35:29.809 --> 02:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
and what we are asking the state of New
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do is follow federal law it
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
is the federal law that a parent
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
approached the Veterans Administration
 
02:35:39.469 --> 02:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
and follow the apportionment process at
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
which times the VA will allocate those
 
02:35:43.969 --> 02:35:43.979 align:start position:0%
funds to the parent it is not in the
 
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
state's purview to issue These funds so
 
02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to flag that to you guys I
 
02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
know that USC 511 will be provided to
 
02:35:56.030 --> 02:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
you and it is my hope that we have
 
02:35:58.130 --> 02:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
Carson Tucker on the phone who is an
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
attorney who just won a Supreme Court
 
02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
case in another state prevailing over
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that veterans disability
 
02:36:08.809 --> 02:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
compensation should not be included in a
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
state's child support calculations thank
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%

02:36:59.690 --> 02:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm actually in the United

and I would love for you um to be able
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
to read that I think it's extremely
 
02:37:11.690 --> 02:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
important to clarify some of the
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about federal law for
 
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
example I'll go over one in particular
 
02:37:19.610 --> 02:37:19.620 align:start position:0%

career I was enlisted before that in the
Navy

02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
Navy
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I sent a tremendous amount of
 
02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
veterans downrange which meant I uh took
 
02:37:52.490 --> 02:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
care of their legal Affairs uh advised
 
02:37:53.809 --> 02:37:53.819 align:start position:0%
them and their families what would
 
02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
happen to them if they did not come back
 
02:37:57.050 --> 02:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
or if they did come back wounded and
 
02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
injured and I can tell you that um I
 
02:38:02.570 --> 02:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
sent thousands of veterans uh deployed
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
thousands of veterans and you know they
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
did not all come back and the ones that
 
02:38:08.450 --> 02:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
did come back did not come back the same
 
02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
as when they left and this has had an
 
02:38:12.530 --> 02:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
enormous impact upon me and the work
 
02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
that I have done in the last uh
 
02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
essentially six or seven years for
 
02:38:19.309 --> 02:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans it's uh uh it's
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
something that I have taken very
 
02:38:23.929 --> 02:38:23.939 align:start position:0%
seriously and um I want to establish a
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
misconception Rose versus Rose is a 1987
 
02:38:28.730 --> 02:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
opinion from the United state supreme
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
court which did state that the states
 
02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
were free to consider veterans
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
disability pay even if the veteran is a
 
02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
hundred percent disabled for purposes of
 
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
establishing a child support obligation
 
02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
the year after Rose versus Rose in 1988
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
Congress established legislation called
 
02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:51.899 align:start position:0%
the veterans judicial review act they
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
amended Provisions that were referred to
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
in Rose as uh allowing the United States
 
02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to hold that way
 
02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:02.469 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to hold that way
Congress

02:39:02.469 --> 02:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
fundamentally changed the Paradigm for
 
02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
the consideration by the states of
 
02:39:10.910 --> 02:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
veterans disability pay for child
 
02:39:13.490 --> 02:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
support and spousal support purposes and
 
02:39:15.410 --> 02:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
the reason that that's so important to
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
understand it was in 1988 I have seen as
 
02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker said firsthand the
 
02:39:25.849 --> 02:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
states have spent the better part of 30
 
02:39:25.859 --> 02:39:27.410 align:start position:0%
states have spent the better part of 30
years

02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:39:30.889 --> 02:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't want to say ignoring but
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
um misunderstanding and misapplying
 
02:39:36.110 --> 02:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
these Federal statutes that restrict and
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
limit the States from considering a very
 
02:39:41.929 --> 02:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
specific amount of disability
 
02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
compensation that's paid to veterans
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh in child support obligations and what
 
02:39:49.730 --> 02:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
it does is it allows the states to count
 
02:39:52.030 --> 02:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the veterans income
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's 100 disability or if
 
02:39:56.929 --> 02:39:56.939 align:start position:0%
there are other sources it allows them
 
02:39:59.570 --> 02:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
to take 100 of that disability
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
compensation and put it over in The
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
Ledger of available income uh earlier
 
02:40:05.809 --> 02:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
someone asked whether there were
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
specific legal provisions and laws I
 
02:40:09.530 --> 02:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
will give you those they are in the
 
02:40:14.570 --> 02:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
statement 38 USC section 511
 
02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
um removed concurrent jurisdiction from
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
the state courts to consider even the
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not these
 
02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
benefits can be considered section 511
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
of title 38 of the United States code
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
actually states that the veterans the
 
02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the
 
02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
exclusive final and conclusive
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction with respect to all
 
02:40:41.210 --> 02:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
questions of law in fact concerning a
 
02:40:43.730 --> 02:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
claim for benefits by both the veterans
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
and their dependent
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
um the reason that this bill is correct
 
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
is because it allows or I'm sorry it
 
02:40:53.690 --> 02:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
defers to that exclusive jurisdiction of
 
02:40:55.610 --> 02:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Administration the Veterans
 
02:40:58.250 --> 02:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
Administration and the secretary can and
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
in some cases do a portion of part of
 
02:41:04.610 --> 02:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
the veterans disability compensation and
 
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
allow that to be paid to the um to the
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
dependents in support obligations but it
 
02:41:12.650 --> 02:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
it has to be the VA that does that
 
02:41:14.330 --> 02:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
because they have the Appropriations
 
02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
from Congress by virtue of the military
 
02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
Powers Clauses in the Constitution which
 
02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
is the source of this legislation and as
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
some of you may know when Congress
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
passes legislation pursuant to its
 
02:41:28.849 --> 02:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
enumerated powers the supremacy clause
 
02:41:30.410 --> 02:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
provides that that's legislation
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
preempts all state law that stands in
 
02:41:35.690 --> 02:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
its way another misconception of rose
 
02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
is that um the statement that states
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
have presumption
 
02:41:42.889 --> 02:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
presumptions of authority and
 
02:41:44.809 --> 02:41:44.819 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over matters concerning
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
domestic and family law that was a
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
statement that was stated in Rose but in
 
02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
fact every Supreme Court case before and
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
after Rose has rejected that proposition
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
and in fact Hillman versus Moretta which
 
02:41:59.270 --> 02:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
is a 2015 case from the U.S Supreme
 
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
Court and Howell versus Howell which is
 
02:42:04.910 --> 02:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
a 2017 case from the United States
 
02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court which is the case that I
 
02:42:09.170 --> 02:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
was the Amicus brief writer on I'm
 
02:42:11.150 --> 02:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
admitted to the U.S Supreme Court for
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
the Veterans of Foreign Wars that was a
 
02:42:15.230 --> 02:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
unanimous opinion agreeing with every
 
02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
one of the propositions we posited
 
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
concerning the protection that federal
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
law provides for these particular
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
benefits okay
 
02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and and the statement in Rose that's
 
02:42:29.090 --> 02:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
been rejected is while State family and
 
02:42:31.849 --> 02:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
family property law must do major damage
 
02:42:33.770 --> 02:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
to clear and substantial Federal
 
02:42:35.929 --> 02:42:35.939 align:start position:0%
interests before the supremacy clause
 
02:42:38.929 --> 02:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
will demand that state law be overridden
 
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
the relative importance to the state of
 
02:42:45.230 --> 02:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
its own law is not Material when there
 
02:42:47.389 --> 02:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
is a conflict with a valid federal law
 
02:42:49.610 --> 02:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
because the framers of our constitution
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
provided that federal law must Prevail
 
02:42:55.130 --> 02:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
and specifically this is a quote from
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court a state
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
divorce decree like other laws governing
 
02:43:02.570 --> 02:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
the economic aspects of domestic
 
02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
relations must give way to clearly
 
02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
conflicting Federal enactments that
 
02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
principle is but the necessary
 
02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
consequence of the supremacy clause of
 
02:43:14.450 --> 02:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
the national Constitution that case is
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
Ridgeway versus Ridgeway it's been
 
02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
repeated in Hillman versus Mareta on
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
2015 case from the court and again in
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
Howell versus Howell the 2017 case now I
 
02:43:30.170 --> 02:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
want to assure the committee that there
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
is provision in the law in federal law
 
02:43:35.690 --> 02:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
for the payment to dependence of support
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
obligations ah
 
02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 317 refers to that
 
02:43:45.889 --> 02:43:45.899 align:start position:0%
provision it's 42 USC 659 H-1B
 
02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
3 and 42 U.S 659 h1a25
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
those two Provisions explain clearly
 
02:43:57.710 --> 02:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
when the states can and when they cannot
 
02:44:00.650 --> 02:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
count as quote unquote remuneration for
 
02:44:02.809 --> 02:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
employment which is income these
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
benefits the issue here and I think it's
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
a cultural issue as well as an economic
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
issue and it's an issue that relates to
 
02:44:13.849 --> 02:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have been at War on one
 
02:44:15.849 --> 02:44:15.859 align:start position:0%
sense or another for over 30 years
 
02:44:18.830 --> 02:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
multiple theaters of operation
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
um significant injuries we have over 5
 
02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
million disabled veterans in the United
 
02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
States 70 percent of that number is
 
02:44:29.929 --> 02:44:29.939 align:start position:0%
greater than 70 percent disabled and the
 
02:44:32.030 --> 02:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're not retirees these are people
 
02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
that go into the military spend four
 
02:44:36.889 --> 02:44:36.899 align:start position:0%
five six seven years they get injured
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
and wounded too much to continue in that
 
02:44:41.330 --> 02:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
career so they become disabled and
 
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
medically discharged we're not talking
 
02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm sorry to interrupt but we
 
02:44:50.450 --> 02:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
have to stop now
 
02:44:52.130 --> 02:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna have to recess the is
 
02:44:55.969 --> 02:44:55.979 align:start position:0%
public hearing to a future date and time
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
it will be noticed in the calendar those
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%

all right
 
02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I am recessing the public hearing on
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 317 and we will be in recess
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:43.200 --> 03:41:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:53.330 --> 03:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.510 --> 03:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
people have to know I do have a laptop
 
03:41:57.889 --> 03:41:57.899 align:start position:0%
and I just have to get it configured
 
03:42:01.330 --> 03:42:01.340 align:start position:0%
enough so that I can use it Oh
 
03:42:04.370 --> 03:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
no I got it
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
afraid of last week I got it right and
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:13.130 --> 03:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
all right on the other hand I figured to
 
03:42:19.130 --> 03:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.429 --> 03:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:27.950 --> 03:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
what part of the cell phone do you have
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
I have a TracFone okay
 
03:42:32.570 --> 03:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
oh yeah look there's no cell phone
 
03:42:35.389 --> 03:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
reception where I live either so uh no
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
point in having a fancy phone
 
03:42:38.040 --> 03:42:40.550 align:start position:0%
point in having a fancy phone
together

03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:42:42.050 --> 03:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
but there are lots of good things about
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.960 --> 03:42:55.250 align:start position:0%
 
ing

03:42:55.250 --> 03:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
all right so I don't have representative
 
03:42:58.680 --> 03:43:00.349 align:start position:0%
all right so I don't have representative
Testament

03:43:00.349 --> 03:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
Testament
 
03:43:16.570 --> 03:43:16.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.120 --> 03:43:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
oops

03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to go on to clarify what
 
03:43:38.090 --> 03:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.809 --> 03:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone Thanks for
 
03:43:45.729 --> 03:43:45.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:48.769 --> 03:43:48.779 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify before we start
 
03:43:52.190 --> 03:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
the next hearing I I know I sounded a
 
03:43:54.290 --> 03:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
little confused last time because I said
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
recess twice but we are going to we we
 
03:43:59.929 --> 03:43:59.939 align:start position:0%
are recessing
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
um 317 to another date
 
03:44:05.570 --> 03:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay and when I said recess I meant we
 
03:44:07.969 --> 03:44:07.979 align:start position:0%
were recessing for lunch but 317 but
 
03:44:10.969 --> 03:44:10.979 align:start position:0%
we'll be rescheduled to another date
 
03:44:14.330 --> 03:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
um okay as will
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately
 
03:44:19.610 --> 03:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 68 I only scheduled a half
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
an hour for it and it's going to take a
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
lot longer than that so I'm gonna have
 
03:44:29.330 --> 03:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
to reschedule that one at 145. we'll get
 
03:44:31.370 --> 03:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
through as many as we can and then we'll
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
have to then we'll have to be
 
03:44:35.090 --> 03:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
rescheduled also
 
03:44:35.100 --> 03:44:37.130 align:start position:0%
rescheduled also
okay

03:44:37.130 --> 03:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:40.490 --> 03:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
so is everyone ready did everyone have
 
03:44:44.210 --> 03:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:47.330 --> 03:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
good good okay
 
03:44:47.340 --> 03:44:48.610 align:start position:0%
good good okay

03:44:48.610 --> 03:44:48.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:52.130 --> 03:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.570 --> 03:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right so I'm gonna open
 
03:45:01.550 --> 03:45:01.560 align:start position:0%

03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
I will follow up the Bill's sponsor

03:45:17.450 --> 03:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.570 --> 03:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
I thought we have to do a roll call to
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're all present
 
03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.349 --> 03:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
do we have to do that
 
03:45:33.359 --> 03:45:36.830 align:start position:0%
do we have to do that
Christina

03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
no I can see that there is a quorum
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
present so we don't need to do that oh
 
03:45:41.760 --> 03:45:42.769 align:start position:0%
present so we don't need to do that oh
okay

03:45:42.769 --> 03:45:42.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%

03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
so representative Testament
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh I uh this is Dave testerman I
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
represent uh two Wards of Franklin in
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
the town of Hill uh this is my third
 
03:46:04.080 --> 03:46:06.349 align:start position:0%
the town of Hill uh this is my third
term

03:46:06.349 --> 03:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
term
 
03:46:10.190 --> 03:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing a bill to you today hb68 is
 
03:46:13.490 --> 03:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
a relatively straightforward uh it uh
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's about two sentences it
 
03:46:18.530 --> 03:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
just changes the deaf one it adds a
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
definition to one of the cases for child
 
03:46:22.080 --> 03:46:23.630 align:start position:0%
definition to one of the cases for child
abuse

03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
03:46:25.790 --> 03:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
I don't care how parents want to dress
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
their kids how they want to address
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
their kids
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
things like that not my not my business
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
to get into is the bill says I'm just
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
talking about drugs and operations or
 
03:46:37.800 --> 03:46:38.809 align:start position:0%
talking about drugs and operations or
surgery

03:46:38.809 --> 03:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
03:46:41.389 --> 03:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit like you know cutting
 
03:46:45.410 --> 03:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
off a finger a little boy points at you
 
03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
because it represents a gun uh that's
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
not something you should do of course uh
 
03:46:55.969 --> 03:46:55.979 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago we we banned a female
 
03:47:00.050 --> 03:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
genital immutilation uh it's uh it's a
 
03:47:02.570 --> 03:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
law now and of course we don't want to
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
be doing that in a case like this
 
03:47:08.929 --> 03:47:08.939 align:start position:0%
uh using puberty blockers these are
 
03:47:11.650 --> 03:47:11.660 align:start position:0%
hormones they're used to slow down the
 
03:47:15.170 --> 03:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
puberty cycle or in fact sometimes uh
 
03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know stop it all together it's not
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
really a healthy uh in many cases it has
 
03:47:25.090 --> 03:47:25.100 align:start position:0%
long-term effects it ends up with
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
Suicidal Tendencies blood clots brittle
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
bones things like that
 
03:47:35.450 --> 03:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
a few uh what would have been a year and
 
03:47:38.210 --> 03:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
a half ago I talked to a person who had
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh gone the complete route he was very
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
unsatisfied with his life he decided to
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
change it and had a an operation and
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
took all the hormones and so on
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing he said was I
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
still had the same problems I did before
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
the same concerns and so on so it's
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat a pointless issue I know a lot
 
03:48:05.229 --> 03:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
of people talk about it but it's really
 
03:48:07.849 --> 03:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
somewhat nonsensical
 
03:48:12.410 --> 03:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh okay yeah all I'm trying to do is
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
protect young kids by the time most
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
children are 20 to 25
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
they'll have decided whatever their
 
03:48:22.729 --> 03:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
sexual preferences are are probably the
 
03:48:25.190 --> 03:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
same ones they were born with it's
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
higher high percentage of that
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.779 --> 03:48:36.229 align:start position:0%

03:48:40.250 --> 03:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%

03:49:48.170 --> 03:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
these caseworkers are currently dealing
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:55.250 --> 03:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
I am I and uh yeah this is a situation
 
03:49:57.769 --> 03:49:57.779 align:start position:0%
that I think is important uh and it
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
should be uh should be taken care of by
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
dcyf that's no excuse for an easy wayf
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
not to do their job
 
03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
and one more follow-up and one more
 
03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:08.630 align:start position:0%
and one more follow-up and one more
follow-up

03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:50:11.570 --> 03:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
and why sir do you feel like this should
 
03:50:14.150 --> 03:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
be child abuse
 
03:50:18.050 --> 03:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
well it clearly uh makes a physical
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
change either through drugs or through
 
03:50:25.969 --> 03:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
surgery uh that just makes no sense to
 
03:50:29.170 --> 03:50:29.180 align:start position:0%
do it yeah it's like I said earlier
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
would you cut off the index finger
 
03:50:34.429 --> 03:50:34.439 align:start position:0%
because a little boy points it and uses
 
03:50:39.530 --> 03:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative cross
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
hi representative testerman
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that when these
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
children go see doctors for
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
let's say surgery there are multiple
 
03:51:00.410 --> 03:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
check boxes that they have to
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
hit before the doctor will do any type
 
03:51:06.769 --> 03:51:06.779 align:start position:0%
of surgery
 
03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes I am I've seen some of the
 
03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:11.469 align:start position:0%
yes yes I am I've seen some of the
checklists

03:51:11.469 --> 03:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
checklists
 
03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
in this case because I'm only talking
 
03:51:16.849 --> 03:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
about children you know you would have a
 
03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
delay until age 18. you know there's
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.260 --> 03:51:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.370 --> 03:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh hello representative Testament my
 
03:51:34.380 --> 03:51:35.389 align:start position:0%
uh hello representative Testament my
question

03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:51:37.490 --> 03:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I have two quick questions
 
03:51:39.050 --> 03:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
one is
 
03:51:39.060 --> 03:51:39.889 align:start position:0%
one is
um

03:51:39.889 --> 03:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:43.190 --> 03:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's a very different
 
03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
um there's a there's a big difference
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
between a child that's six and wants a
 
03:51:48.410 --> 03:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
sex change
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and a child that's 16 or 17 that has
 
03:51:55.969 --> 03:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
been through a lot more of the
 
03:51:59.090 --> 03:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
counseling the medications and the
 
03:52:00.769 --> 03:52:00.779 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments with their parents
 
03:52:03.889 --> 03:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
you're proposing that the parents get
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh criminally charged
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
with child abuse for that when they have
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
been working with doctors and probably
 
03:52:15.290 --> 03:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
therapists along the way
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
up until the age of 18. if that's what
 
03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
the abuse law calls for then that's what
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:26.690 --> 03:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
Lester man my question then would be
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
what would happen to the
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
with that doctor be charged with child
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
abuse I'm not sure how that goes but it
 
03:52:39.290 --> 03:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
it supposedly he was one of the
 
03:52:41.690 --> 03:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
reporting people he would have to to
 
03:52:43.550 --> 03:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
report it if he didn't report it he
 
03:52:45.530 --> 03:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
would be guilty of child abuse
 
03:52:47.929 --> 03:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
would he also be guilty of child abuse
 
03:52:49.550 --> 03:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
if that child ended up committing
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
suicide because it didn't get the
 
03:52:52.729 --> 03:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
treatment it needed
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
I think that is a case that is these
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
children are they do have a higher
 
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
suicide rate
 
03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
having that kind of operation and that
 
03:53:07.849 --> 03:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
kind of drugs won't reduce it
 
03:53:11.150 --> 03:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
do you have statistics to back up those
 
03:53:14.150 --> 03:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
facts I don't have them with me
 
03:53:15.769 --> 03:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
could you get those to the committee
 
03:53:18.429 --> 03:53:18.439 align:start position:0%
please I could yes you know
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative cross oh Madam chairwoman
 
03:53:25.010 --> 03:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
I had another another follow-up question
 
03:53:28.610 --> 03:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
I I apologize I'm sorry uh
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative cross just one minute
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry go ahead I'm sorry
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
um representative testerman if you are
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
saying that parents are criminally
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
um having their child go through a
 
03:53:49.729 --> 03:53:49.739 align:start position:0%
medical treatment like that could it not
 
03:53:49.739 --> 03:53:51.110 align:start position:0%
medical treatment like that could it not
be

03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:53:51.120 --> 03:53:51.950 align:start position:0%
be
um

03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
like where does this end so could you
 
03:53:58.010 --> 03:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
then charge a parent if their teenage
 
03:54:00.410 --> 03:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
child has an abortion
 
03:54:03.290 --> 03:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
um many would have would
 
03:54:05.870 --> 03:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
possibly think that that is child abuse
 
03:54:07.969 --> 03:54:07.979 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about that I'm just
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
talking about this one specific
 
03:54:12.170 --> 03:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
situation I wouldn't I know but you're
 
03:54:15.050 --> 03:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
opening the door is what I'm saying I I
 
03:54:17.330 --> 03:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
don't believe I am opening the door
 
03:54:19.370 --> 03:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
I mean you
 
03:54:19.380 --> 03:54:21.110 align:start position:0%
I mean you
yeah

03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:54:23.450 --> 03:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
you have definitions of abuse is that
 
03:54:25.849 --> 03:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
open the door for me
 
03:54:29.410 --> 03:54:29.420 align:start position:0%
I mean I I just think it's a a
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
ludicrous comparison
 
03:54:35.450 --> 03:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:54:37.729 --> 03:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
representative cross
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%

03:54:44.170 --> 03:54:44.180 align:start position:0%
proof of any plastic surgeons performing
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
surgeries Top surgery any kind of
 
03:54:51.290 --> 03:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
surgery changing their bodies in any way
 
03:54:55.610 --> 03:54:55.620 align:start position:0%

I do not I know of some cases
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
nationally but I don't know in New

Hampshire

03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
there any further questions for
 
03:55:14.809 --> 03:55:14.819 align:start position:0%

Tang
 
03:55:58.189 --> 03:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm a 17 year old trans person who goes
 
03:56:00.170 --> 03:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
to school in New Hampshire
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
I oppose House Bill 68 because I believe
 
03:56:03.889 --> 03:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
that denying me the health care I need
 
03:56:06.290 --> 03:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
to feel safe and affirmed is abuse in
 
03:56:07.490 --> 03:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
and of itself
 
03:56:10.010 --> 03:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
under house bill 68's proposed changes I
 
03:56:11.210 --> 03:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
would not be able to get the surgery nor
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
the hormone treatment I need for my
 
03:56:15.469 --> 03:56:15.479 align:start position:0%
mental and physical health
 
03:56:17.210 --> 03:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
when I was young whenever I looked in
 
03:56:19.490 --> 03:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
the mirror I never ever saw a body or a
 
03:56:20.809 --> 03:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
face that I could call mine or feel
 
03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable with I have been trans for
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
as long as I've been able to think and
 
03:56:26.450 --> 03:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
feel and move and I can confirm it's not
 
03:56:29.570 --> 03:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
a phase and if it is 17 years is an
 
03:56:31.370 --> 03:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
awfully long period of time to call a
 
03:56:31.380 --> 03:56:32.150 align:start position:0%
awfully long period of time to call a
phase

03:56:32.150 --> 03:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
phase
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
before I even knew what word to call
 
03:56:35.870 --> 03:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
myself or what to call myself or what I
 
03:56:38.090 --> 03:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
was I learned about transness through
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
someone called Leela Alcorn
 
03:56:42.410 --> 03:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
her name was Lila Alcorn she committed
 
03:56:44.929 --> 03:56:44.939 align:start position:0%
suicide on December 28 2014 because she
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
never received the gender affirming care
 
03:56:48.170 --> 03:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
or support she needed
 
03:56:50.389 --> 03:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
for months I followed eulogy's articles
 
03:56:52.250 --> 03:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
and comments calling her by the wrong
 
03:56:54.410 --> 03:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
name and the wrong pronoun the first
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
trans youth I ever knew I knew through
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%

03:57:39.410 --> 03:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
a step backwards is House Bill 68. we
 
03:57:41.090 --> 03:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
need to keep on moving forward and that
 
03:57:42.889 --> 03:57:42.899 align:start position:0%
means opposing bills like these
 
03:57:45.410 --> 03:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care is health care and
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 68 would make it illegal for
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
me as a minor to receive the health care
 
03:57:50.570 --> 03:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
that affirms my identity
 
03:57:52.429 --> 03:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill 68 would make it illegal for
 
03:57:53.929 --> 03:57:53.939 align:start position:0%
my peers in the trans Community to feel
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
affirmed and to finally feel comfortable
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
and safe in their own bodies why do you
 
03:57:59.210 --> 03:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
think 40 of trans people that aren't
 
03:58:00.349 --> 03:58:00.359 align:start position:0%

access to a basic human right it tells

that can act as caretakers is the best
 
03:59:18.830 --> 03:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
way to keep trans youth healthy in a
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
safe environment it is not abuse but
 
03:59:22.610 --> 03:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
rather affirmation a Yale University
 
03:59:24.769 --> 03:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
study found in 2020 that for Trans folks
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
that received gender affirming surgery
 
03:59:28.130 --> 03:59:28.140 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts to drop to zero up to
 
03:59:29.229 --> 03:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
three years after their surgery
 
03:59:31.729 --> 03:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
furthermore a 2018 study published in
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
JMA Pediatrics corroborates out of 68
 
03:59:35.689 --> 03:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
trans youth that receive gender
 
03:59:37.490 --> 03:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery virtually none of them
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
experienced any regret up to five years
 
03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
after their surgery in fact their
 
03:59:43.250 --> 03:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
dysphoria was significantly reduced as a
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
result of the surgery
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
this type of Health Care works this type
 
03:59:48.469 --> 03:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
of Health Care is what me and many other
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
trans youth need to continue having
 
03:59:52.010 --> 03:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
access to
 
03:59:54.050 --> 03:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
maintaining the ability for Trans youth
 
03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
to receive gender affirming surgery and
 
03:59:57.050 --> 03:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
treatment gives us the ability to
 
03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
transition with our families before we
 
04:00:00.769 --> 04:00:00.779 align:start position:0%
leave for college or before we leave for
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
the workplace both of which are
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar environments at least
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
separate trans kids from our support
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
systems that would otherwise help us
 
04:00:07.199 --> 04:00:09.110 align:start position:0%
systems that would otherwise help us
transition

04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
transition
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
doctors activists academics families and
 
04:00:15.650 --> 04:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
trans youth have all provided countless
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
reasons and statistics and studies to
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
support maintaining access to gender
 
04:00:20.450 --> 04:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery and treatment for
 
04:00:23.689 --> 04:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
Trans youth none of it is ever abuse you
 
04:00:25.189 --> 04:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
should join us in opposing house bill
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
68. opposing this bill is an opportunity
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
to Signal your support for the trans
 
04:00:31.010 --> 04:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire and Across
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
the Nation because opposing this bill is
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
a recognition that access to healthcare
 
04:00:36.530 --> 04:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
is a basic human right and a recognition
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
that families have the freedom to work
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
with their trans youth in deciding if
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care will help them
 
04:00:43.250 --> 04:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
it is a recognition that access to
 
04:00:44.689 --> 04:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
health care for Trans youth is not abuse
 
04:00:46.910 --> 04:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
but affirmation it is recognition that
 
04:00:48.769 --> 04:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
doctors families and most importantly
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
trans youth know what is best for them
 
04:00:53.150 --> 04:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
not someone without a medical degree
 
04:00:54.889 --> 04:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
opposing the spell signals to families
 
04:00:55.849 --> 04:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
that they have the right to choose
 
04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
gender firming surgery and treatment for
 
04:00:59.090 --> 04:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
their trans Youth and as a step forward
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen along with this
 
04:01:01.849 --> 04:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
rest of the nation
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%

04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%

04:01:09.769 --> 04:01:09.779 align:start position:0%
testify before State committees when
 
04:01:10.969 --> 04:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
there's an issue we especially believe
 
04:01:10.979 --> 04:01:11.809 align:start position:0%
there's an issue we especially believe
in

04:01:11.809 --> 04:01:11.819 align:start position:0%

youth Outreach worker with trans youth I
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because I believe it is
 
04:02:38.450 --> 04:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
harmful to trans Youth and their
 
04:02:40.030 --> 04:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
Guardians in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
it is not the state's place to make a
 
04:02:44.450 --> 04:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not someone
 
04:02:46.250 --> 04:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
should receive gender affirming Medical
 
04:02:49.849 --> 04:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
Care much less Define it as child abuse
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
this could be harmful for a trans youth
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
trans youth need our support and need to
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
be equitably included they are some of
 
04:02:59.450 --> 04:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable in our community and
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
this could in fact lead to worsening of
 
04:03:04.189 --> 04:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
mental health issues I believe this bill
 
04:03:06.769 --> 04:03:06.779 align:start position:0%
is a danger to trans youth in their
 
04:03:09.410 --> 04:03:09.420 align:start position:0%

04:08:17.450 --> 04:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
we strongly urge you to vote no on House
 
04:08:20.210 --> 04:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
Bill 68 which would cause incredible
 
04:08:22.250 --> 04:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
harm to the health and well-being of
 
04:08:25.250 --> 04:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
transgender youth in New Hampshire
 
04:08:27.769 --> 04:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
it can be hard to understand what it is
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
like to have a transgender child
 
04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
especially if you've never met someone
 
04:08:34.130 --> 04:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
who is transgender
 
04:08:36.769 --> 04:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
parents of transgender children
 
04:08:39.290 --> 04:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
like most parents simply want to do what
 
04:08:41.450 --> 04:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
is best for their child
 
04:08:44.210 --> 04:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
in addition to harming transgender youth
 
04:08:46.849 --> 04:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
this bill would directly interfere in
 
04:08:48.650 --> 04:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
the physician patient family
 
04:08:51.769 --> 04:08:51.779 align:start position:0%

medical professionals not politicians

questioning or gender diverse
 
04:09:21.170 --> 04:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy path for many
 
04:09:23.929 --> 04:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
children and teenagers around half of
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
these children consider suicide and the

third attempt it
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
we know that if youth are provided with
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate gender affirming care the

04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
medical treatment ever used and only in
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
some patients
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
treatment with medications to
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
temporarily suppress puberty is
 
04:11:30.650 --> 04:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
reversible and allows the patient time
 
04:11:32.809 --> 04:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
with their ongoing medical supervision
 
04:11:35.450 --> 04:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
of their doctor to explore their gender
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
identity before committing to a
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
treatment path
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
these puberty suppressing medications
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
are commonly used for other conditions
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
such as early puberty and prostate
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
conditions in men and their safety is
 
04:11:51.769 --> 04:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
well established later teenagers can
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
elect to receive hormonal therapy if it
 
04:11:56.570 --> 04:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
is indicated generally after the age of
 
04:11:59.150 --> 04:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
16 and after living in their authentic
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
gender for some time
 
04:12:03.650 --> 04:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
fewer than one quarter of transgender
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
patients ever have surgical procedures
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
and these are generally recommended
 
04:12:10.330 --> 04:12:10.340 align:start position:0%
after age 18.
 
04:12:12.410 --> 04:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
this bill would make providing
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Medical Care according to
 
04:12:16.610 --> 04:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized medical standards
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
of practice a crime
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
providing patient care that has helped
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
rather than harms is our duty according
 
04:12:27.290 --> 04:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
to our Oaths as doctors this bill sets a
 
04:12:28.969 --> 04:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedent and puts politics
 
04:12:31.610 --> 04:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
rather than medical expertise ahead of
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
our patients health
 
04:12:35.330 --> 04:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
this bill is an extreme attack on
 
04:12:37.070 --> 04:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
transgender youth in New Hampshire and
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
will criminalize access to
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medical care for this
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population by all standards
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
this bill is also an egregious attack on
 
04:12:46.610 --> 04:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
pediatricians and other medical
 
04:12:48.290 --> 04:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
professionals ability to provide
 
04:12:50.210 --> 04:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
evidence-based Medical Care
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote no on House Bill 68.
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:13:00.410 --> 04:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
um Miss arsenau
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:13:07.250 --> 04:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
now I'd like to go back to Allison for
 
04:13:11.469 --> 04:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
y'all if I see her in the
 
04:13:15.050 --> 04:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
waiting room so we will have her
 
04:13:15.060 --> 04:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
waiting room so we will have her
um

04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
Allison you would ask for five minutes
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask you to keep it to
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yeah yes oh
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful keep it to the five minutes
 
04:13:36.050 --> 04:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
that you requested though because and I
 
04:13:37.729 --> 04:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
won't even need that much because I feel
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
like all these speakers have already
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
said much of what I wanted to sing
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
especially the first Speaker I applaud
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
that individual so much such passion and
 
04:13:50.330 --> 04:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
knowing knowing themselves so well
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I am speaking as a parent of a
 
04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
transgendered son as well as a nurse and
 
04:13:58.610 --> 04:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
a future nurse practitioner
 
04:14:00.769 --> 04:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
what I have seen
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
is the psychological damage that can
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
happen from somebody who is not allowed
 
04:14:07.969 --> 04:14:07.979 align:start position:0%
to be themselves and a bill like this
 
04:14:12.290 --> 04:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
would destroy my son even more he
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
um has self-mutilated he has
 
04:14:17.809 --> 04:14:17.819 align:start position:0%
contemplated suicide and according to
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
different research out there over half
 
04:14:23.210 --> 04:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent of transgender youth
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
either contemplate or attempt suicide
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
when they don't have appropriate
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
treatment right now my son is on a
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
hormone blocker this is reversible it
 
04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
does not do any damage to him all it's
 
04:14:37.490 --> 04:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
doing is stopping him from getting a
 
04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
period which is very traumatic
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
soon hopefully he'll be starting
 
04:14:45.650 --> 04:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
testosterone which has made him so happy
 
04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
I can't even explain that much and I
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
really wish that representative
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
testerman could be here to hear these
 
04:14:51.779 --> 04:14:52.610 align:start position:0%
testerman could be here to hear these
things

04:14:52.610 --> 04:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:14:54.650 --> 04:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
I'm happy that he has kids and that he's
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
never had to experience the hardship of
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
a child wanting to kill themselves
 
04:15:01.490 --> 04:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
and maybe if he had he'd have a slight
 
04:15:04.910 --> 04:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
bit of empathy for this but I'm pleading
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
with this house to not pass this to vote
 
04:15:11.570 --> 04:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
no and to show all the youth in our
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
state and in our country that we want
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
the best for them that we love them and
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we support them thank you
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
04:15:21.840 --> 04:15:24.410 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
Mysterio

okay saying none thank you very much
 
04:15:29.570 --> 04:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.510 --> 04:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately I am going to have to
 
04:15:35.150 --> 04:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
recess this recording because
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
there were 69 people who
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
um signed up in advance for this to
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%

um recess this to a letter later date
 
04:15:55.370 --> 04:15:55.380 align:start position:0%

over 70 people because this is they're
 
04:16:13.969 --> 04:16:13.979 align:start position:0%

speak on behalf of hb60
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
with this bill we hope
 
04:17:20.330 --> 04:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
to rage for an in-child marriage in
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why am I determined to end
 
04:17:25.010 --> 04:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
child marriage the answer is simple
 
04:17:28.010 --> 04:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
marriage before age 18
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
can have lifelong impacts on people's
 
04:17:32.929 --> 04:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
lives undermining their health and
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
education economic opportunities and
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
increasing their
 
04:17:40.670 --> 04:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
risk of experiencing violence
 
04:17:42.710 --> 04:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the past five years I've worked to
 
04:17:44.330 --> 04:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
raise awareness and attempted to end
 
04:17:46.490 --> 04:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
child marriage I have talked with
 
04:17:46.500 --> 04:17:48.110 align:start position:0%
child marriage I have talked with

this if there's history held their hands
 
04:17:53.689 --> 04:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
and cried with them I have made
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
connections and partnered with
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
organizations who work on their
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
behalf and I am beyond pleased that so
 
04:18:02.769 --> 04:18:02.779 align:start position:0%
many are here with us today

04:18:08.349 --> 04:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
are ready to share their
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
history some are not and are just
 
04:18:12.710 --> 04:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
watching the proceedings
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%

04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%

if we move forward
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to leave something
 
04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
damaging in the past and move on to a

think that pregnant teen is on their own

marriage should not be encouraged just
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%

longer will we wait before it's time to

stop this practice how many of our

are there any questions for
 
04:28:30.649 --> 04:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.250 --> 04:28:34.260 align:start position:0%

so up next I'm going to call
Representative

04:28:37.729 --> 04:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
04:28:59.649 --> 04:28:59.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
all right I'm here can you hear me yes
 
04:29:06.290 --> 04:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much for the record
 
04:29:09.290 --> 04:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
my name is Mary Beth walls I am the
 
04:29:10.729 --> 04:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative for Merrimack County
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
District number uh 23 which is the towns
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
of Bowen Dunbarton I'm in my seventh
 
04:29:18.410 --> 04:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
term and for purpose of this testimony I
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
want to point out that I'm a lawyer
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
who's actually currently certified in
 
04:29:23.290 --> 04:29:23.300 align:start position:0%
four jurisdictions to practice because
 
04:29:26.570 --> 04:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
the main point of my testimony today and
 
04:29:27.649 --> 04:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
and there are others that are going to
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
address other issues but mine is to
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
address some of the legal consequences
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
facing New Hampshire in this bill
 
04:29:36.050 --> 04:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to start with pointing out
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
that under our current law our current
 
04:29:40.610 --> 04:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
marriage laws in New Hampshire are
 
04:29:40.620 --> 04:29:42.110 align:start position:0%
marriage laws in New Hampshire are
unconstitutional

04:29:42.110 --> 04:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
and they are unconstitutional because we
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
require people going into a same-sex
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
marriage to be 18 years old to be
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
married for a heterosexual marriage the
 
04:29:56.450 --> 04:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
requirement is only 16. that is clearly
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
an unconstitutional discrepancy here in
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and passing this law and
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
raising everybody to the age of 18 would
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
fix that unconstitutional discrepancy
 
04:30:11.330 --> 04:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
so we are as we sit here today in
 
04:30:14.210 --> 04:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
serious danger of being sued over this
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm frankly surprised it hasn't
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
happened yet but I wanted to start out
 
04:30:19.870 --> 04:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
with what perhaps is the most
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
significant legal problem with our
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
current laws and that is the
 
04:30:24.600 --> 04:30:27.229 align:start position:0%
current laws and that is the
unconstitutionality

04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality
 
04:30:30.410 --> 04:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
um many of you have heard me speak
 
04:30:33.229 --> 04:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
before we have addressed this a number
 
04:30:36.410 --> 04:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
of times in committee over the last few
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
years and one of the things that we did
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
in committee was we raised the burden of
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
proof and marriage
 
04:30:47.210 --> 04:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
so for a minor child to get married
 
04:30:50.450 --> 04:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
today they need to go and get a judge's
 
04:30:52.670 --> 04:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
approval in a New Hampshire Court
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
and that standard before was the lowest
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
possible standard and we raised that
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
standard to the mid-level standard of
 
04:31:04.370 --> 04:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence
 
04:31:07.490 --> 04:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
so now when a child goes to court the
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
judge has to find by a standard of clear
 
04:31:12.110 --> 04:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence which is about a
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
75 or 80 percent standard that it is in
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child to
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
approve that marriage
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
so our Hope was that this would drop the
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
number of child marriages in New
 
04:31:24.479 --> 04:31:25.429 align:start position:0%
number of child marriages in New
Hampshire

04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:31:28.729 --> 04:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
we passed the law in 2018 effectively
 
04:31:31.729 --> 04:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
the beginning of 2019 it's now been in
 
04:31:34.490 --> 04:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
effect two years while I don't have the
 
04:31:37.849 --> 04:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
data on child marriages in 2020 I do
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
have them in 2019 and the marriage rate
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
is unchanged
 
04:31:46.130 --> 04:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
so it unfortunately did not drop the
 
04:31:48.170 --> 04:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
rate of child marriage at all in this
 
04:31:48.180 --> 04:31:49.070 align:start position:0%
rate of child marriage at all in this
state

04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
I will tell you there's been some sort
 
04:31:53.929 --> 04:31:53.939 align:start position:0%
of natural drop I've got the data from
 
04:31:59.389 --> 04:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
2009. and from 2000 to about 2011 we had
 
04:32:01.490 --> 04:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
double digit number of kids anywhere
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
from you know 12 to 25 who were getting
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
married in the state
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
since then it has dropped and from 2012
 
04:32:11.689 --> 04:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
on it's been in the single digits and
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
last year uh for the last year I have
 
04:32:16.849 --> 04:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
data which is 2019 there were five child
 
04:32:16.859 --> 04:32:18.349 align:start position:0%
data which is 2019 there were five child
marriages

04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
marriages
 
04:32:20.809 --> 04:32:20.819 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of them 85 percent of
 
04:32:23.090 --> 04:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
them involve a woman or a young girl
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually being married to a man
 
04:32:28.010 --> 04:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and while now many of them are
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
similar ages there's still a third of
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
them that are marrying people who are
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
significantly older than they are
 
04:32:37.729 --> 04:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
so the courts are still rubber stamping
 
04:32:43.490 --> 04:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.500 --> 04:32:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to talk about
 
04:32:49.729 --> 04:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
um a little bit legally about how we
 
04:32:52.610 --> 04:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
treat children under the law
 
04:32:55.130 --> 04:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
um there is extensive uh evidence out
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
there that many of you are aware of
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
about the physical or lack of physical
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
and emotional maturity of children
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
and we have recognized that in the law
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
you have to be 18 to vote you have to be
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
18 to sign a contract
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
to sign a lease to open a bank account
 
04:33:15.289 --> 04:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
to buy a house
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
to buy a car
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
um at 16 and 17 you cannot smoke
 
04:33:24.051 --> 04:33:24.061 align:start position:0%
you cannot drop out of school
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
um you are still subject at 16 and 17 to
 
04:33:34.490 --> 04:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
the delinquency laws in our state
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
and when a child goes to toast
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
themselves at a wedding when it's a
 
04:33:40.490 --> 04:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
child marriage they can't do that
 
04:33:43.849 --> 04:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
because they're not old enough to drink
 
04:33:47.570 --> 04:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
across the board we recognize 16 and 17
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
year olds as children
 
04:33:53.090 --> 04:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
and by failing to recognize them here
 
04:33:57.369 --> 04:33:57.379 align:start position:0%
we are uh making a major mistake
 
04:33:59.929 --> 04:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
we know that children who go into
 
04:34:02.269 --> 04:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
marriage are eighty percent of those
 
04:34:04.490 --> 04:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
marriages are likely to end in divorce
 
04:34:07.131 --> 04:34:07.141 align:start position:0%
that means if the five children that we
 
04:34:10.250 --> 04:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
know that were married in 2019 four of
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
them are probably already divorced
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
because most of those divorces happen
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
we know that the education dropout rate
 
04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
is much higher we know that this leads
 
04:34:24.289 --> 04:34:24.299 align:start position:0%
to a lifetime of poverty for those we
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
know that this poverty extends into
 
04:34:28.131 --> 04:34:28.141 align:start position:0%
multi-generational as it did in Cassie's
 
04:34:28.141 --> 04:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
multi-generational as it did in Cassie's
family

04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:34:32.810 --> 04:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
we need to recognize that 16 and 17 year
 
04:34:35.150 --> 04:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
olds are still children when it comes to
 
04:34:35.160 --> 04:34:36.349 align:start position:0%
olds are still children when it comes to
marriage

04:34:36.349 --> 04:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
04:34:39.170 --> 04:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
we need to pass House Bill 60 and we
 
04:34:41.810 --> 04:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
need to fix this unconstitutionality in
 
04:34:42.890 --> 04:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
our law
 
04:34:46.490 --> 04:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm prepared to take any questions
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walls I have a
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
couple of quick questions
 
04:34:53.209 --> 04:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
um can you refresh my memory when the
 
04:34:56.570 --> 04:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
last change in statute went into effect
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
I put I pulled statutes this morning and
 
04:35:02.090 --> 04:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
it looks like the last amendment was
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.051 --> 04:35:09.061 align:start position:0%
when it went into effect
 
04:35:10.849 --> 04:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
I think the first of the year I think it
 
04:35:12.289 --> 04:35:12.299 align:start position:0%
was the one that changed the burden of
 
04:35:12.299 --> 04:35:13.189 align:start position:0%
was the one that changed the burden of
proof

04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
proof
 
04:35:15.890 --> 04:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100 sure the way the laws are
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
the statutes are presented in the rsas
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's not immediately apparent you can
 
04:35:23.150 --> 04:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
see the date the last year of change but
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
you can't exactly see what the change is
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
but I was hunting through old bills on
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
our website today and I from what I can
 
04:35:34.010 --> 04:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
see that's the most recent change
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and um just for one
 
04:35:40.250 --> 04:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
regarding emancipation didn't we just
 
04:35:43.609 --> 04:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
change the Emancipation statute
 
04:35:43.619 --> 04:35:44.750 align:start position:0%
change the Emancipation statute
um

04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
two years ago was it I think that was
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
about I did not look at the Emancipation
 
04:35:52.369 --> 04:35:52.379 align:start position:0%
statutes this morning I'm sorry but I
 
04:35:54.769 --> 04:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
think it was the same year I do think
 
04:35:56.570 --> 04:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
that it was an 18 that we changed it and
 
04:35:59.090 --> 04:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
probably went into effect in 19.
 
04:36:01.789 --> 04:36:01.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm gonna have the
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
committee researcher send us the
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
Emancipation patient statute and um the
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
current marriage statute and to also
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
find out the exact date that that went
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
into effect
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
well the the marriage statute I can tell
 
04:36:17.449 --> 04:36:17.459 align:start position:0%
you because I did find it and it was
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2019 it was signed in 18 and
 
04:36:22.970 --> 04:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
went into effect in 19. I suspect the
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
Emancipation is the same but if they
 
04:36:27.470 --> 04:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
look at the bills that were in 2018
 
04:36:29.209 --> 04:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
you're going to find that's where those
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
bills were
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:36:34.369 --> 04:36:34.379 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
representative walls representative
 
04:36:35.879 --> 04:36:38.090 align:start position:0%
representative walls representative
Belanger

04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
Belanger
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
the vice chair can go first okay
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:47.689 --> 04:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
um representative walls walls excuse me
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
um of the list that you named when you
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
talked about being able to smoke or
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
um sign up for the military or um of
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
that list how many of those are you
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
aware of that you need parental approval
 
04:37:05.570 --> 04:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
to be involved in
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
because correct me if I'm wrong you can
 
04:37:09.890 --> 04:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
sign up for the military under the age
 
04:37:13.310 --> 04:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
of 18 if a parent does sign
 
04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
um for you
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger I wondered that
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
so I researched it this morning and
 
04:37:20.810 --> 04:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
honestly I'm not an expert on it and
 
04:37:22.490 --> 04:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
there are witnesses Beyond me that know
 
04:37:24.109 --> 04:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
more than I do I know they're going to
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
testify but what I found when I was
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
Googling it is that you can enlist at
 
04:37:28.080 --> 04:37:29.510 align:start position:0%
Googling it is that you can enlist at
17.

04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
17.
 
04:37:31.131 --> 04:37:31.141 align:start position:0%
um it did not appear that we can still
 
04:37:33.769 --> 04:37:33.779 align:start position:0%
enlist at 16 but it does the they did
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
say you can enlist at 17 when I was
 
04:37:38.051 --> 04:37:38.061 align:start position:0%
trying to research that
 
04:37:39.910 --> 04:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:37:42.769 --> 04:37:42.779 align:start position:0%
so just of the list that you named off
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
can you give me an exit can you give me
 
04:37:47.990 --> 04:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
any others that would need parental
 
04:37:48.000 --> 04:37:50.750 align:start position:0%
any others that would need parental
approval

04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure with opening a bank
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
account you could open it jointly with
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
parents it's not quite approval I'm sure
 
04:37:59.449 --> 04:37:59.459 align:start position:0%
on buying a house a parent or a car a
 
04:38:01.551 --> 04:38:01.561 align:start position:0%
parent could co-sign a loan again that's
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
not approval that's really them putting
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
themselves out there at the same time
 
04:38:06.959 --> 04:38:09.170 align:start position:0%
themselves out there at the same time
um

04:38:09.170 --> 04:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.390 --> 04:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
I can't see anything else in here where
 
04:38:13.490 --> 04:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
you need parental approval
 
04:38:15.131 --> 04:38:15.141 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
04:38:19.609 --> 04:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
thank you question representative walls
 
04:38:24.529 --> 04:38:24.539 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what constitutional
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
article talks about safe gender marriage
 
04:38:31.369 --> 04:38:31.379 align:start position:0%
well nothing specifically addresses same
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
gender marriage what IT addresses is
 
04:38:35.090 --> 04:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the equal protection
 
04:38:38.570 --> 04:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
clause and so it's it's really the 14th
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and when you look at the 14th
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment the equal protection Clause
 
04:38:44.209 --> 04:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
says that you've got to treat people in
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
a similar way similarly situated people
 
04:38:49.330 --> 04:38:49.340 align:start position:0%
in a similar way
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
so representative walls I just have one
 
04:39:00.051 --> 04:39:00.061 align:start position:0%
more question because I I'm going to get
 
04:39:01.730 --> 04:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
the statute and look it over but I could
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
have sworn that we amended the marriage
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
bill so that we wouldn't run into that
 
04:39:06.359 --> 04:39:07.789 align:start position:0%
bill so that we wouldn't run into that
problem

04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:39:10.010 --> 04:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
I I thought we included same-sex
 
04:39:10.020 --> 04:39:11.570 align:start position:0%
I I thought we included same-sex
marriage

04:39:11.570 --> 04:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
in that bill am I wrong I I did not find
 
04:39:18.769 --> 04:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
it when I was researching it that and
 
04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know Kim this is my seventh term
 
04:39:23.449 --> 04:39:23.459 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this a long time I don't
 
04:39:26.689 --> 04:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
recall but I when I was looking it up I
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
did not find that you could be correct
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:39:32.330 --> 04:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
um but honestly my recollection was not
 
04:39:33.890 --> 04:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
the same as yours
 
04:39:36.289 --> 04:39:36.299 align:start position:0%
yeah but my recollection isn't that good
 
04:39:36.299 --> 04:39:39.948 align:start position:0%
yeah but my recollection isn't that good
so

04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions for
 
04:39:45.288 --> 04:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
all right saying that you've been saying
 
04:39:50.330 --> 04:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much representative
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
okay and up next we're going to take our
 
04:39:57.410 --> 04:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Al chiller
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:40:01.130 --> 04:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair I
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
unmuted ahead of time this time so
 
04:40:07.250 --> 04:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you committee members for your
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
time and attention to this really
 
04:40:11.810 --> 04:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
important matter marriage is a contract
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire cannot enter
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
into legal contracts before they reach
 
04:40:19.850 --> 04:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
the age of majority which is 18. it's
 
04:40:22.850 --> 04:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
the threshold of adulthood as recognized
 
04:40:25.250 --> 04:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
in law and I submit to the committee
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
that the people on in New Hampshire
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
under the age of majority who must seek
 
04:40:33.288 --> 04:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
parental and judicial approval to enter
 
04:40:36.770 --> 04:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
into a contract which they may not exit
 
04:40:39.530 --> 04:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
until they actually reach the age of
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
majority is a manifestation of coercive
 
04:40:42.718 --> 04:40:44.050 align:start position:0%
majority is a manifestation of coercive
control

04:40:44.050 --> 04:40:44.060 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:40:47.090 --> 04:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
coercive control creates an unequal
 
04:40:49.970 --> 04:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
power dynamic in a relationship it's a
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
form of domestic abuse and intimate
 
04:40:55.130 --> 04:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
partner violence it describes a pattern
 
04:40:58.368 --> 04:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
of behaviors a perpetrator uses to gain
 
04:41:01.850 --> 04:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
control and power by eroding a person's
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
autonomy and self-esteem and this
 
04:41:06.650 --> 04:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
includes acts of intimidation threats
 
04:41:09.170 --> 04:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
and humiliation the younger the
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
Adolescent the more likely it is that if
 
04:41:14.750 --> 04:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
they are sexually active they have
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
experienced coercive sex this is the
 
04:41:19.850 --> 04:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
core understanding that underlies our
 
04:41:22.970 --> 04:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
statutory rape laws and coercion is one
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the three warning signs of the
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
presence of human trafficking according
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%

States existing laws against child

when girls at risk of child marriage or

in the U.S 200 000 children under the

age of 18 were married off between the
 
04:43:58.610 --> 04:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
ages between the year 2000 and 2015. PBS

Frontline dug into that number and
 
04:44:03.410 --> 04:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
discovered that more than 80 percent of
 
04:44:06.708 --> 04:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
those children who were married off were
 
04:44:09.050 --> 04:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
married off to somewhat substantially
 
04:44:10.850 --> 04:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
older than them
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%

are they burdens to be discarded raising

the floor the entrance into the contract

of marriage to be 18 years old for all
 
04:44:27.170 --> 04:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens will be a
 
04:44:29.330 --> 04:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
meaningful step in curbing the violence

yes okay thank you very much Madam

chairperson much of what my testimony
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
should be very brief because much of it
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
has already been stated I think one of
 
04:45:14.810 --> 04:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
the important things to note right off
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
the fact is that the U.S state
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
department and you've heard this has
 
04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
called child marriage human rights abuse
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
04:45:29.448 --> 04:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
when it's when is it when a child is
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
married off they are 50 50 more likely
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
to drop out of high school
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
they are four times less likely to
 
04:45:43.250 --> 04:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.410 --> 04:45:45.420 align:start position:0%

school after childbirth
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
than mothers who are not married off
 
04:45:53.510 --> 04:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and that's important those that are not
 
04:45:55.850 --> 04:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
married tend to keep their family
 
04:45:55.860 --> 04:45:57.350 align:start position:0%
married tend to keep their family
relationships

04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
and they tend to go back to school
 
04:46:01.128 --> 04:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
because of the support facilities that
 
04:46:03.530 --> 04:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
they have amongst their family which
 
04:46:05.448 --> 04:46:05.458 align:start position:0%
they do not get if they are out of the

family and married off
 
04:46:10.128 --> 04:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
they tend to be lifelong wage earners
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
because of their lack of Education
 
04:46:16.490 --> 04:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
being like long wage low wage earners
 
04:46:19.730 --> 04:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
they earn 30 percent will live their
 
04:46:22.490 --> 04:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
entire life in po poverty and this is
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
something that is multi-generational as
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
well so it isn't just the one single
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
person the young girl or young boy who
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
marries at a very young age who is in
 
04:46:34.490 --> 04:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
poverty but they tend to have more
 
04:46:37.310 --> 04:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
further Generations in that situation
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
married teens are 40 more likely to give
 
04:46:44.570 --> 04:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
birth to a second child within 24 months
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
and they are three times more likely to
 
04:46:51.410 --> 04:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
have at least five children
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
when we look at the rates of welfare in
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
our country and within our state a lot
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
of times we look and we look down on a
 
04:46:59.330 --> 04:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
family that has a number of children
 
04:47:01.550 --> 04:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of children well this is
 
04:47:03.170 --> 04:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
a rate because they probably were
 
04:47:05.090 --> 04:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
married at a very young age
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
did not attend did not finish school
 
04:47:10.610 --> 04:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
have lived in poverty and know nothing
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
else about that being a mother who is on
 
04:47:13.200 --> 04:47:15.288 align:start position:0%
else about that being a mother who is on
Welfare

04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
Welfare
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
lastly they have a shockingly high
 
04:47:22.368 --> 04:47:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
just one other thing that I would want
 
04:47:26.030 --> 04:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
to address I had a chance to talk to
 
04:47:28.430 --> 04:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
someone in the National Guard in the U.S
 
04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
who had been in the Army and he advises
 
04:47:32.510 --> 04:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh he is currently in the Army's first
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
sergeant in the in the National Guard
 
04:47:36.590 --> 04:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
and he advises new recruits and one of
 
04:47:38.570 --> 04:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
the questions he has a lot of times is
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
my girlfriend is pregnant is there a
 
04:47:43.788 --> 04:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
problem here we aren't married
 
04:47:47.690 --> 04:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
and he says have no fear you are covered
 
04:47:50.090 --> 04:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
if you name her as a dependent the child
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
is a dependent they are covered under
 
04:47:55.610 --> 04:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
the military benefits programs so that's
 
04:47:57.170 --> 04:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
not an issue I know people have brought
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
it up in the past and throughout the
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
years that we've talked about this bill
 
04:48:02.090 --> 04:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
that's one of the big things is that oh
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
the young boy who's going off to war or
 
04:48:06.650 --> 04:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
going off to the military has got his
 
04:48:08.208 --> 04:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
girlfriend home and he needs to marry
 
04:48:09.770 --> 04:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
her before he leaves so she won't get
 
04:48:12.288 --> 04:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
the benefits it's not true
 
04:48:14.208 --> 04:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman I'll be happy to answer
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:48:17.330 --> 04:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:48:19.570 --> 04:48:19.580 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Grassi
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Belanger uh thank you
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
grassy for taking my question uh my
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
question to you sir is
 
04:48:32.330 --> 04:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
when you refer to quote married off
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
unquote can you define what you mean by
 
04:48:34.680 --> 04:48:35.990 align:start position:0%
unquote can you define what you mean by
that

04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
in other words in this situation you
 
04:48:39.770 --> 04:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
have parents who are agreeing or signing
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
off to basically
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership of that young lady or
 
04:48:47.330 --> 04:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
young boy to their spouse and in many
 
04:48:49.250 --> 04:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
cases a young girl who is with a man
 
04:48:52.368 --> 04:48:52.378 align:start position:0%
that is much older uh it's a way to get
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
people out of get a girl out of their
 
04:48:57.890 --> 04:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
family uh in some cases it's uh it's
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's not right
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times you know some of these
 
04:49:04.850 --> 04:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
young girls they're in love
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
and particularly if the boy is going off
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
into the military or
 
04:49:11.810 --> 04:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
um these marriages don't last a long
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
time they end up on their own so when I
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
say married off I think it's important
 
04:49:18.350 --> 04:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
to look at it that way they're not
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
consenting to a the parents aren't
 
04:49:21.890 --> 04:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
consenting to a marriage they could wait
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
till 18 if they wanted to do that what
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
they're doing is they're basically
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
removing their daughter from their
 
04:49:26.760 --> 04:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
removing their daughter from their
family

04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.570 --> 04:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
just for clarification
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
my husband in no way owns me never has
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
never will neither does my first husband
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
that I got married with at 19.
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay just because I got married young
 
04:49:48.410 --> 04:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.970 --> 04:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
04:49:52.070 --> 04:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative grassy a follow-up
 
04:49:54.050 --> 04:49:54.060 align:start position:0%

I'm 26 years old I'm married too I've
 
04:50:01.010 --> 04:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
been with my wife since she was 17 and I
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
was 18. I do not own my wife for the
 
04:50:06.050 --> 04:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
record I agree with you madam chair

um in regards to
 
04:50:11.878 --> 04:50:13.868 align:start position:0%
um in regards to
that

04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
sorry I lost it my apologies
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so representative grassy
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
just need clarification on uh
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
married married out I understand what
 
04:50:37.970 --> 04:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
you're saying so we're talking about
 
04:50:41.810 --> 04:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
16 15 year olds that I'm marrieding 40
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
year olds or 35 year olds not a 17 year
 
04:50:48.170 --> 04:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
old married and an 18 year old or a 19
 
04:50:54.970 --> 04:50:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.850 --> 04:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
a 17 year old marrying a 25 year old and
 
04:51:00.590 --> 04:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I think that the the thing you're
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
looking at as well is when I say
 
04:51:05.690 --> 04:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
ownership that young girl at 16 years
 
04:51:08.570 --> 04:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
old cannot engine a contract
 
04:51:10.430 --> 04:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
she has to have her husband do those
 
04:51:12.530 --> 04:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
things for her
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
so so in a sense that that is an
 
04:51:18.890 --> 04:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
accurate a statement okay so uh follow
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
up Madam chair
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
sure so the um
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
the ownership in your mind is if I'm in
 
04:51:29.150 --> 04:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
if I'm underage and the uh
 
04:51:31.490 --> 04:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm into a contract that I can't get
 
04:51:33.410 --> 04:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
out of until I'm
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
at age
 
04:51:37.970 --> 04:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh that is what you're forming has
 
04:51:37.980 --> 04:51:39.830 align:start position:0%
uh that is what you're forming has
ownership

04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
04:51:42.288 --> 04:51:42.298 align:start position:0%
yeah it was probably a poor term to use
 
04:51:45.890 --> 04:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
in a sense but the thing is is yes many
 
04:51:47.690 --> 04:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
girls who get stuck in that situation
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
feel they have no way out
 
04:51:51.288 --> 04:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
and you know when you're looking at that
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
that they have no way out it makes it
 
04:52:01.250 --> 04:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.050 --> 04:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
04:52:03.060 --> 04:52:04.368 align:start position:0%
are there any other
um

04:52:04.368 --> 04:52:04.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:07.490 --> 04:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
I have a question I do believe that when
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
we passed the Emancipation The Limited
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
emancipation a few years ago we did
 
04:52:12.480 --> 04:52:14.150 align:start position:0%
emancipation a few years ago we did
include

04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
include
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
marriage so that I believe we included
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
it so that they could contract an
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
attorney to get out of the marriage and
 
04:52:23.868 --> 04:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
so that they could um open their own
 
04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
bank account would you believe that
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
I would
 
04:52:28.798 --> 04:52:30.430 align:start position:0%
I would
thanks

04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:52:32.570 --> 04:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Litchfield you have a
 
04:52:32.580 --> 04:52:33.948 align:start position:0%
representative Litchfield you have a
question

04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair actually I believe
 
04:52:38.690 --> 04:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
that you've just answered it um but if I
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
could just repeat it and you clarify my
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
question was basically is so is the
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
bottom line concern on this bill not
 
04:52:49.368 --> 04:52:49.378 align:start position:0%
necessarily the age of mad marriage but
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
rather the opportunity to dissolve the
 
04:52:53.868 --> 04:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
union if necessary am I hearing that
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
correctly no no it is the age of
 
04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
marriage specifically it is not the
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
right to dissolve the marriage but to
 
04:53:03.410 --> 04:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
someone who is 16 or 17 uh getting into
 
04:53:05.690 --> 04:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
that situation statistically statistics
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
have proven that they have a much they
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
have it much harder in life even if they
 
04:53:12.288 --> 04:53:12.298 align:start position:0%
can dissolve the marriage uh when you're
 
04:53:14.810 --> 04:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
married at 16 or 17 a lot of that is
 
04:53:14.820 --> 04:53:16.070 align:start position:0%
married at 16 or 17 a lot of that is
beyond

04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
um your ability to understand what's
 
04:53:19.368 --> 04:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
going on you're in a bad City you may be
 
04:53:21.470 --> 04:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
in a bad situation you may be hopefully
 
04:53:23.810 --> 04:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
in a good situation eighty percent of
 
04:53:25.610 --> 04:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
them turn out not to be good situations
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
and they end up in divorce
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
so it's that's not it it's not being
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
able to get out of the situation they
 
04:53:33.650 --> 04:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be put into into the situation
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
where they are allowed to get themselves
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
into that kind of situation prior to
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
Turning 18. I mean I know 18 and 19 year
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
old boys and girls that shouldn't be
 
04:53:44.570 --> 04:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
married as well but our age or majority
 
04:53:46.730 --> 04:53:46.740 align:start position:0%

um thank you for allowing me the space
 
04:54:30.170 --> 04:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
to testify again my name is Don Tyree
 
04:54:33.288 --> 04:54:33.298 align:start position:0%
and I'm a member of the public I'm a
 
04:54:35.390 --> 04:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
Survivor of child marriage and I'm here
 
04:54:38.510 --> 04:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
to support hb60 in ending child marriage
 
04:54:40.670 --> 04:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's never in the best interest for a
 
04:54:42.890 --> 04:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
child to marry I was forced into
 
04:54:45.350 --> 04:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
marriage at 13 years old
 
04:54:47.090 --> 04:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
and while I can relate that that's much
 
04:54:48.288 --> 04:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
younger than what we're talking about
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
today I can tell you that a 17 year old
 
04:54:53.090 --> 04:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
is at risk and it has devastating
 
04:54:53.100 --> 04:54:55.970 align:start position:0%
is at risk and it has devastating
repercussions

04:54:55.970 --> 04:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
repercussions
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
my marriage was more about abuse control
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
and manipulation Than Love
 
04:55:05.208 --> 04:55:05.218 align:start position:0%
I was married to my rapist after he got
 
04:55:07.250 --> 04:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
me pregnant he had been sexually abusing
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
me for two years
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
I was powerless over my body with no
 
04:55:14.090 --> 04:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
rights not one adult in my life talked
 
04:55:16.610 --> 04:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
to me about birth control so 13 months
 
04:55:18.890 --> 04:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
later I had my second child at 15 years
 
04:55:18.900 --> 04:55:20.930 align:start position:0%
later I had my second child at 15 years
old

04:55:20.930 --> 04:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
old
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's no equality in America in a
 
04:55:25.788 --> 04:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
child marriage even a 17 year old to a
 
04:55:28.250 --> 04:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
19 year old there is no equality it
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
started off without equality
 
04:55:34.730 --> 04:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
I couldn't register myself for school at
 
04:55:36.410 --> 04:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
15 years old and I couldn't register
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
myself for school at 17 years old when I
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
left him I left at 16 years old and when
 
04:55:43.610 --> 04:55:43.620 align:start position:0%
I went to register myself back into high
 
04:55:46.010 --> 04:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
school at 17 years old I was told that I
 
04:55:48.530 --> 04:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
needed my parents and when I when I
 
04:55:50.930 --> 04:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I was divorced and wanted
 
04:55:52.910 --> 04:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
to enroll myself in school I was told
 
04:55:54.830 --> 04:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
that I needed my ex-husband to come and
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.110 --> 04:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
I couldn't rent a hotel room when I
 
04:56:01.970 --> 04:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave with my new with my two
 
04:56:01.980 --> 04:56:03.410 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave with my new with my two
children

04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:56:05.810 --> 04:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
I was turned away from shelters and
 
04:56:08.030 --> 04:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
Social Services advised me to go back to
 
04:56:09.530 --> 04:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
my parents
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
my my ex-husband reported me as a
 
04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
runaway and law enforcement threatened
 
04:56:18.288 --> 04:56:18.298 align:start position:0%
to take me back to my ripe rapist
 
04:56:20.810 --> 04:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
we live below the poverty line for
 
04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
probably a decade
 
04:56:25.368 --> 04:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
we lived without toilet paper or shampoo
 
04:56:30.650 --> 04:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
how was I to go back to school work or
 
04:56:37.990 --> 04:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.270 --> 04:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
investigations are dangerous loopholes
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
saying that the court is going to
 
04:56:45.890 --> 04:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
mandate an investigation before allowing
 
04:56:47.208 --> 04:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
a marriage
 
04:56:50.930 --> 04:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
puts the minor at even more risk she has
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
been manipulated and coerced for weeks
 
04:56:56.810 --> 04:56:56.820 align:start position:0%
before the marriage to say yes
 
04:57:00.530 --> 04:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
there is no way that a minor child is
 
04:57:04.190 --> 04:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
going to stand up against their parents
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
or a caseworker and say look I'm being
 
04:57:10.730 --> 04:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
forced to do this I'm being coerced
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
children are peacemakers and they're
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that we have evolved as a
 
04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
nation and that our laws need to do the
 
04:57:22.560 --> 04:57:23.390 align:start position:0%
nation and that our laws need to do the
same

04:57:23.390 --> 04:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:57:26.090 --> 04:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
teen marriage is a thing of the past and
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes lots of our parents grandparents and
 
04:57:31.730 --> 04:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
ancestors married young
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're a different Nation now I think we
 
04:57:36.530 --> 04:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
can agree that we want our children to
 
04:57:39.530 --> 04:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
have the same opportunities as we did or
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
as most of us have and that is to live
 
04:57:45.128 --> 04:57:45.138 align:start position:0%
to their fullest potential
 
04:57:49.010 --> 04:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
emancipation is not going to save this
 
04:57:52.850 --> 04:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
as I said my marriage was considered an
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
automatic emancipation And yet when I
 
04:57:57.470 --> 04:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
want it out or needed a lawyer or wanted
 
04:57:59.330 --> 04:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
to enroll in school
 
04:58:03.288 --> 04:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
going back to the military that we were
 
04:58:09.890 --> 04:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier my second husband
 
04:58:13.010 --> 04:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
was a career active duty in the Army and
 
04:58:15.410 --> 04:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
then Coast Guard and retired as a Navy
 
04:58:17.690 --> 04:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
officer recruiter
 
04:58:20.090 --> 04:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
two of my sons joined the military one
 
04:58:21.708 --> 04:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
in the National Guard and one in the
 
04:58:21.718 --> 04:58:22.730 align:start position:0%
in the National Guard and one in the
Navy

04:58:22.730 --> 04:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
Navy
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
they both signed contracts at 17 years
 
04:58:26.930 --> 04:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
old and that contract was a promise not
 
04:58:29.930 --> 04:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
a legal binding contract so in fact even
 
04:58:31.850 --> 04:58:31.860 align:start position:0%
though they signed it and promised that
 
04:58:34.128 --> 04:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
they would join at 18 years old they
 
04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
could have backed out if they wanted to
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
I submitted a written testimony for
 
04:58:41.810 --> 04:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
myself and that of another child
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
marriage Survivor and I thank you to the
 
04:58:47.810 --> 04:58:47.820 align:start position:0%

the 17 year old that I was allowed to
interview

04:58:52.850 --> 04:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
interview
 
04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
wished that there were Protections in
 
04:58:59.090 --> 04:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
place to prevent her from marrying
 
04:59:02.810 --> 04:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to marry but were told
 
04:59:04.850 --> 04:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
that it was in their best interest to
 
04:59:04.860 --> 04:59:06.470 align:start position:0%
that it was in their best interest to
marry

04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
marry
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
they believed that had they not married
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
and had they stayed home there's we're
 
04:59:11.628 --> 04:59:11.638 align:start position:0%

before they turned 18.
 
04:59:15.530 --> 04:59:15.540 align:start position:0%

04:59:17.330 --> 04:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
graduated from high school felt
 
04:59:19.868 --> 04:59:19.878 align:start position:0%

05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
years old and I live in North Haverhill
 
05:00:08.030 --> 05:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where I attend Woodsville
 
05:00:10.490 --> 05:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
high school I'm also a member of the
 
05:00:12.830 --> 05:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory Council and
 
05:00:14.530 --> 05:00:14.540 align:start position:0%
though I'm not representing them today
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
at the moment we are planning on
 
05:00:19.490 --> 05:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
releasing a statement as it pertains to
 
05:00:22.368 --> 05:00:22.378 align:start position:0%
this Bill I'm here to testify in support
 
05:00:25.550 --> 05:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
of hb60 and act relative to raising the
 
05:00:28.128 --> 05:00:28.138 align:start position:0%
minimum age of marriage I've been
 
05:00:30.350 --> 05:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
following this issue and representative
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
levesque's work on it for quite some
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
time and so I'm super excited to be here
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
today to hear the discussion and to add
 
05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
my two cents
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be graduating high school
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
in a couple of months and heading off to
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
college and I'm so blessed to be in a
 
05:00:47.448 --> 05:00:47.458 align:start position:0%
situation where I can do that where I've
 
05:00:49.250 --> 05:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
been financially and emotionally
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
supported and now I can take the next
 
05:00:52.430 --> 05:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
step in my life
 
05:00:54.288 --> 05:00:54.298 align:start position:0%
most victims of child marriage aren't so
 
05:00:56.330 --> 05:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
lucky as we've already discussed women
 
05:00:58.850 --> 05:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
who marry as minors are 50 more likely
 
05:01:00.770 --> 05:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
to drop out of high school and those who
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
do go to college are four times less
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
likely to finish this leaves them with a
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
lack of opportunities for growth in
 
05:01:08.090 --> 05:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
their careers making them financially
 
05:01:10.070 --> 05:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
dependent on their husbands especially
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
when there are children involved this
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
makes it harder for them to escape when
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
they are faced with abuse at the hands
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
of their spouse and unfortunately abuse
 
05:01:19.250 --> 05:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
rates are high in child marriages
 
05:01:21.650 --> 05:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
women who married under the age of 18
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
are three times more likely to be abused
 
05:01:25.850 --> 05:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
than women who aren't this fact should
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
be even more concerning considering the
 
05:01:29.448 --> 05:01:29.458 align:start position:0%
uptick in reports of domestic violence
 
05:01:31.730 --> 05:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
05:01:33.530 --> 05:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
a common argument for child marriage is
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
teen pregnancy supporters want teens to
 
05:01:37.850 --> 05:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
be able to get married as if marriage
 
05:01:40.010 --> 05:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
somehow is a solution and that's an
 
05:01:41.810 --> 05:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
argument within itself but regardless
 
05:01:43.910 --> 05:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
the statistics show that marriage as a
 
05:01:45.530 --> 05:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
result of teen pregnancy does more harm
 
05:01:46.490 --> 05:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
than good
 
05:01:48.410 --> 05:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
teen mothers who marry are even less
 
05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
likely to go to college than those those
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
who don't and teen mothers who marry
 
05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
before or within two years of the birth
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
of their first child are more likely to
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
have a second child within that two-year
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
interval if we really wanted to do
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
something about teen pregnancy maybe
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's time we take another look at our
 
05:02:05.030 --> 05:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
state's sex ed guidelines which haven't
 
05:02:08.690 --> 05:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
been updated last I checked since 2003.
 
05:02:10.850 --> 05:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
and sex ed isn't required in the state
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
outside of learning about STIs and HIV
 
05:02:15.050 --> 05:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to take another look into
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of teen pregnancy I think
 
05:02:18.708 --> 05:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
that's a better way to start and as for
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
supporting teen mothers maybe we should
 
05:02:22.128 --> 05:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
invest more into programs that actually
 
05:02:24.288 --> 05:02:24.298 align:start position:0%
support their needs like lowering the
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
cost of education and child care and
 
05:02:27.650 --> 05:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
paid family leave
 
05:02:31.128 --> 05:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
as I said I'm 17 years old and I wanted
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
to testify today because in the state of
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm legally allowed to
 
05:02:37.310 --> 05:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
marry with my parents permission I
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
flattened myself to say that I'm a
 
05:02:41.390 --> 05:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
pretty responsible kid I don't drink I
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
do my chores study hard and keep my nose
 
05:02:43.680 --> 05:02:44.448 align:start position:0%
do my chores study hard and keep my nose
clean

05:02:44.448 --> 05:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
clean
 
05:02:47.208 --> 05:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
but I'm just a kid three weeks ago I
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
almost burned down my house making
 
05:02:48.480 --> 05:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
almost burned down my house making
waffles

05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
waffles
 
05:02:51.410 --> 05:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
I don't even know how to schedule my own
 
05:02:53.090 --> 05:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments let alone how to
 
05:02:56.510 --> 05:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
be a wife no one by age does to say that
 
05:02:58.490 --> 05:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds aren't mature enough
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
to enter into the commitment that is
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
marriage is ludicrous at best and
 
05:03:03.410 --> 05:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
dangerous at worst
 
05:03:04.850 --> 05:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
don't you remember what it was like to
 
05:03:07.310 --> 05:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
be 17 don't remember how young you were
 
05:03:09.170 --> 05:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
then and how little you knew and how
 
05:03:11.208 --> 05:03:11.218 align:start position:0%
much you've learned since
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I'm so passionate
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
about this issue is because when I hear
 
05:03:16.490 --> 05:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
these statistics I don't just hear
 
05:03:19.490 --> 05:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
numbers I see my friends I see how
 
05:03:21.288 --> 05:03:21.298 align:start position:0%
excited we are to be starting our lives
 
05:03:23.208 --> 05:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
to be planning our next few years at
 
05:03:23.218 --> 05:03:24.288 align:start position:0%
to be planning our next few years at
college

05:03:24.288 --> 05:03:24.298 align:start position:0%
college
 
05:03:26.090 --> 05:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
I think of the girls I know who are
 
05:03:28.310 --> 05:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
getting their first car their first kiss
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
who are pulling all-nighters to finish
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
their chem homework and scraping by on
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
three hours of sleep in an ungodly
 
05:03:35.448 --> 05:03:35.458 align:start position:0%
amount of iced coffee
 
05:03:37.550 --> 05:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think of them and it makes me want to
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
cry to think of them being put into a
 
05:03:40.730 --> 05:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
situation where they get married within
 
05:03:42.050 --> 05:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
we are so young we don't know anything
 
05:03:46.368 --> 05:03:46.378 align:start position:0%
we don't know what we want to do with
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
our lives most of us haven't even had
 
05:03:50.448 --> 05:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
our first boyfriends yet we're not ready
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
to be wives and if there are teens out
 
05:03:54.530 --> 05:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
there who think that they're ready to
 
05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
settle down with the love of their life
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
before the age of 18. at most this bill
 
05:04:01.010 --> 05:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
would only be an inconvenience
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
this bill is about giving girls every
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
chance at life we deserve to grow up to
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
find ourselves young people girls and
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
guys shouldn't be getting married before
 
05:04:13.610 --> 05:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
the age of 18. I can see no good
 
05:04:15.170 --> 05:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
arguments as to why we should keep this
 
05:04:17.150 --> 05:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
practice alive in our state and so I
 
05:04:19.128 --> 05:04:19.138 align:start position:0%
hope you join me in supporting hb60
 
05:04:21.770 --> 05:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and um I'm happy
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
to answer for questions if you have any
 
05:04:26.810 --> 05:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any um
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
questions from Miss Reagan
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
05:04:50.330 --> 05:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
hi this is Amanda Parker can you hear me
 
05:04:55.550 --> 05:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.128 --> 05:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chair rice and and for
 
05:04:59.570 --> 05:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
the distinguished committee members for
 
05:05:01.310 --> 05:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
prioritizing a hearing on this important
 
05:05:03.410 --> 05:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
legislation and to representative
 
05:05:05.810 --> 05:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
Levesque for her unrelenting leadership
 
05:05:08.510 --> 05:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
on this issue over the years I'm Amanda
 
05:05:10.250 --> 05:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
Parker I'm the senior director for the
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
AHA Foundation
 
05:05:13.490 --> 05:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
at the AHA Foundation we work to end
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
harmful practices including forced
 
05:05:16.730 --> 05:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
marriage child marriage and female
 
05:05:19.310 --> 05:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
genital mutilation in the U.S including
 
05:05:20.810 --> 05:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
supporting survivors and at-risk
 
05:05:23.270 --> 05:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
individuals find safety and services
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
we were founded by ion here CLE who
 
05:05:27.410 --> 05:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
herself is a survivor of forced marriage
 
05:05:29.570 --> 05:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
and female genital mutilation
 
05:05:32.090 --> 05:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to record our strong
 
05:05:34.490 --> 05:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
support for hb60 which would end all
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
child marriage in the state without
 
05:05:35.760 --> 05:05:37.850 align:start position:0%
child marriage in the state without
exceptions

05:05:37.850 --> 05:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
I want to talk specifically today about
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
the loopholes that allow for 16 and 17
 
05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
year olds to marry
 
05:05:46.368 --> 05:05:46.378 align:start position:0%
the first is the parental consent
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
loophole which dates back to 1907 and
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
which is also absurd
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
in aha foundation's experience when a
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
child is forced to marry the
 
05:05:56.330 --> 05:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
perpetrators are almost always the
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
parents so parental consent is often
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
parental coercion
 
05:06:03.948 --> 05:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
children can easily be forced or coerced
 
05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
into marriage or trapped into abusive
 
05:06:06.060 --> 05:06:07.430 align:start position:0%
into marriage or trapped into abusive
marriages

05:06:07.430 --> 05:06:07.440 align:start position:0%

marriage may feel fear familial violence
 
05:06:14.810 --> 05:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
should they refuse to comply or they may
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
be physically or emotionally manipulated
 
05:06:19.310 --> 05:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
into accepting unwanted marriages
 
05:06:21.288 --> 05:06:21.298 align:start position:0%
minors may also not have the resources
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
to find a way out of the situation
 
05:06:25.128 --> 05:06:25.138 align:start position:0%
they face significant legal and
 
05:06:26.750 --> 05:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
practical barriers if they try to leave
 
05:06:29.930 --> 05:06:29.940 align:start position:0%

file a legal action such as divorce
 
05:06:38.570 --> 05:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
this is why the AHA Foundation started
 
05:06:40.490 --> 05:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
working to fight child marriage in the
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
U.S it's because we had minors coming to
 
05:06:46.010 --> 05:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
us trying to seek escape from a forced
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
marriage and we were unable to use those
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
normal tools that we would have
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
available to us if we were working with
 
05:06:53.868 --> 05:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:55.730 --> 05:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
the judicial review process is also
 
05:06:57.050 --> 05:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
deeply flawed
 
05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
a judge is allowed but not required to
 
05:07:02.208 --> 05:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
interview a 16 or 17 year old who seeks
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
permission to marry without their
 
05:07:05.390 --> 05:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
parents present
 
05:07:07.730 --> 05:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
now even if a judge opts to conduct such
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
an interview that does little to prevent
 
05:07:12.050 --> 05:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
a forced marriage and in fact introduces
 
05:07:13.550 --> 05:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
additional trauma to an already
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
traumatic situation
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
it puts the onus on a terrified 16 or 17
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
year old who is being forced to marry to
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
choose between telling the truth and
 
05:07:25.010 --> 05:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
facing the repercussions back at home or
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
lying to the court
 
05:07:30.110 --> 05:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not the parents Guardians and
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
or the intended spouses are in the room
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
when the interview is occurring the 16
 
05:07:36.288 --> 05:07:36.298 align:start position:0%
or 17 year old knows that the family is
 
05:07:37.610 --> 05:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
going to figure out what happened during
 
05:07:40.250 --> 05:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
the interview based on the outcome
 
05:07:42.288 --> 05:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
we have never heard of a single Survivor
 
05:07:44.090 --> 05:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
going through a judicial review process
 
05:07:45.830 --> 05:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
when they were being forced to marry
 
05:07:47.930 --> 05:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
whoever chose to be honest with the
 
05:07:49.610 --> 05:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
court whether or not they were alone
 
05:07:52.430 --> 05:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
during the court interview
 
05:07:54.288 --> 05:07:54.298 align:start position:0%
a judgment must conclude also that the
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
marriage is in the best interest of the
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
child as we've heard
 
05:07:59.390 --> 05:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
as we've also heard the U.S state
 
05:08:01.128 --> 05:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
department has called marriage before 18
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
human rights abuse and we've also heard
 
05:08:06.110 --> 05:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
about the the numerous harms that are
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
associated with child abuse or with a
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
child marriage right here in the United
 
05:08:09.120 --> 05:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
child marriage right here in the United
States

05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
States
 
05:08:12.050 --> 05:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
now how can something that that we've
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
deemed to be a human rights abuse ever
 
05:08:16.010 --> 05:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
be something that's deemed to be in the
 
05:08:18.050 --> 05:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
best interest of a child
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
it can't
 
05:08:21.708 --> 05:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
judges are prohibited from approving a
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
marriage between parties with an age
 
05:08:24.770 --> 05:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
difference that constitutes statutory
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
rape this is pretty much pointless
 
05:08:28.490 --> 05:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
though because the age of consent is 16
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
and 16 year olds are no longer allowed
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
to marry in New Hampshire
 
05:08:31.860 --> 05:08:32.930 align:start position:0%
to marry in New Hampshire
yeah

05:08:32.930 --> 05:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:08:34.610 --> 05:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
the law also requires the marriage
 
05:08:36.110 --> 05:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
petition to indicate whether the Bureau
 
05:08:37.490 --> 05:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
of child protection has been involved
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
with the child's family however it does
 
05:08:41.090 --> 05:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
not indicate what the judge should do
 
05:08:43.310 --> 05:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
with such information
 
05:08:45.170 --> 05:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
now the solution is not to strengthen
 
05:08:47.090 --> 05:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
this judicial review process by adding
 
05:08:49.128 --> 05:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
more so-called safeguards
 
05:08:51.288 --> 05:08:51.298 align:start position:0%
even the most robust judicial review
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
process has a fatal flaw as I said it
 
05:08:56.510 --> 05:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
puts the onus on children to find a safe
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
way to communicate to a judge that they
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
are being forced into marriage
 
05:09:02.990 --> 05:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
this only causes further trauma in an
 
05:09:04.730 --> 05:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
already traumatic situation
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
children are facing a horrible decision
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
when they face that situation being
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
honest with the court or lying and
 
05:09:12.770 --> 05:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
feeling complicit in their own forced
 
05:09:12.780 --> 05:09:14.570 align:start position:0%
feeling complicit in their own forced
marriage

05:09:14.570 --> 05:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
the parental consent and judicial review
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
process is effectively disempower
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
children allowing adults to enter
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
children into marriage and providing
 
05:09:23.330 --> 05:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
little or no recourse for children who
 
05:09:25.610 --> 05:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
do not who do not want to marry
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
as you've heard today child marriage
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
severely limits opportunities to health
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
education and economic freedom it also
 
05:09:33.530 --> 05:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
increases the risk of domestic violence
 
05:09:36.050 --> 05:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
and it almost always ends in divorce
 
05:09:38.208 --> 05:09:38.218 align:start position:0%
given these factors one case of forced
 
05:09:40.970 --> 05:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
marriage is one too many I urge each of
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%

here at UNICEF USA I am constantly
 
05:10:55.368 --> 05:10:55.378 align:start position:0%
reminded how important it is that
 
05:10:57.530 --> 05:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
children have the right to be children
 
05:11:00.050 --> 05:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
too many children lose that right for
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
too many reasons one of those reasons is
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
child marriage worldwide more than 650
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
million women and girls alive today were
 
05:11:12.288 --> 05:11:12.298 align:start position:0%
married before their 18th birthday some
 
05:11:13.730 --> 05:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
of them are right here in the United
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%

05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
because child marriage often results in
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
child pregnancy girls married at a young
 
05:12:24.890 --> 05:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
age face serious health risks teenage
 
05:12:27.050 --> 05:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
girls are much more likely to die in
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and childbirth than women in
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
their 20s in addition
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
childhood pregnancy increases risks of
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
nutritional deficiencies for both mother
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
and baby with permanent consequences
 
05:12:42.350 --> 05:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
these risks are just as real for child
 
05:12:44.208 --> 05:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
marriages in the United States as they
 
05:12:46.610 --> 05:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
are in developing countries for the sake
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
of protecting children from abuse and
 
05:12:50.810 --> 05:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
protecting their Futures we believe
 
05:12:54.410 --> 05:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
every single U.S state must take steps
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
to ban child marriage child marriage is
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
a violation of Human Rights and comes at
 
05:13:02.448 --> 05:13:02.458 align:start position:0%
a cost Society cannot afford on behalf
 
05:13:04.850 --> 05:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
of Unicef USA I urge you to take a stand
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
for child rights and vote Yes on House
 
05:13:09.770 --> 05:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 6C thank you all so much for your
 
05:13:11.930 --> 05:13:11.940 align:start position:0%

05:13:18.590 --> 05:13:18.600 align:start position:0%

05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
05:13:27.230 --> 05:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.970 --> 05:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Michelle
 
05:13:31.610 --> 05:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
hanash and I'm testifying today in
 
05:13:34.128 --> 05:13:34.138 align:start position:0%
support of hb60 the bill that would
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
finally end the shameful practice of
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
child marriage in New Hampshire
 
05:13:41.150 --> 05:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
marriage at 16 or 17 is extremely
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
harmful and dangerous and that is true
 
05:13:45.288 --> 05:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
even though a child in New Hampshire is
 
05:13:47.810 --> 05:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
currently emancipated automatically upon
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
marriage and here's why automatic
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
emancipation does nothing absolutely
 
05:13:55.550 --> 05:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent the forced marriage
 
05:13:58.010 --> 05:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
because the minor facing the forced
 
05:14:00.350 --> 05:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
marriage is not yet emancipated
 
05:14:03.050 --> 05:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
so a child must first undergo the trauma
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
of the forced marriage which means being
 
05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
raped on the wedding night and often
 
05:14:09.530 --> 05:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
means being pulled out of school before
 
05:14:12.530 --> 05:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
she gets the right to escape you cannot
 
05:14:15.650 --> 05:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
unrape a child by later emancipating her
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and issuing
 
05:14:20.570 --> 05:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
that marriage license is a party to the
 
05:14:23.330 --> 05:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
subjugation of that minor for example
 
05:14:25.610 --> 05:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
miners cannot easily Escape an impending
 
05:14:27.890 --> 05:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
forced marriage just by leaving home and
 
05:14:29.810 --> 05:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
domestic violence shelters will not take
 
05:14:32.090 --> 05:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
in children under the age of 18. and
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
youth shelters are required to alert
 
05:14:36.590 --> 05:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
that Minor's parents within 72 hours and
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
as you heard minors often are not
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to rent a hotel room and is
 
05:14:42.890 --> 05:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible for a minor to obtain
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
legal Health as contracts with children
 
05:14:46.670 --> 05:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
including retainer agreements with
 
05:14:48.770 --> 05:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
attorneys are avoidable and only the
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
most generous attorney would agree to
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
represent a child it is also difficult
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
for a child to obtain a protective order
 
05:14:56.810 --> 05:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
against parents forcing her to marry
 
05:14:58.730 --> 05:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
typically children in New Hampshire
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
cannot even initiate illegal proceeding
 
05:15:03.770 --> 05:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
or obtain a protective order without the
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
assistance from a parent guardian or
 
05:15:08.810 --> 05:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
next friend and the 83 percent of
 
05:15:10.550 --> 05:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
children marrying in New Hampshire who
 
05:15:13.368 --> 05:15:13.378 align:start position:0%
are girls marrying adult men face all
 
05:15:15.470 --> 05:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
these hurdles while their adult spouses
 
05:15:17.690 --> 05:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
have no such handicaps
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
also since the court does not issue an
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
order of limited emancipation with
 
05:15:24.708 --> 05:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
automatic emancipation upon marriage as
 
05:15:26.570 --> 05:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
it typically would in an emancipation
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
proceedings it is entirely unclear
 
05:15:32.330 --> 05:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
whether a child married has the right to
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
file for divorce or seek a protective
 
05:15:36.890 --> 05:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
order against an abusive spouse or even
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
leave home to escape an abusive spouse
 
05:15:41.570 --> 05:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
or unhappy marriage furthermore
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
automatic emancipation is very dangerous
 
05:15:46.730 --> 05:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
it likely ends the parents financial
 
05:15:49.368 --> 05:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
obligation without even evaluating the
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
child's Financial or emotional
 
05:15:53.810 --> 05:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
Independence or educational needs in
 
05:15:55.970 --> 05:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
other cases minors cannot be emancipated
 
05:15:57.948 --> 05:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
unless they first show they have lived
 
05:15:59.448 --> 05:15:59.458 align:start position:0%
separately from their parents or legal
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
Guardians for at least three months can
 
05:16:03.650 --> 05:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
financially support themselves and have
 
05:16:05.208 --> 05:16:05.218 align:start position:0%
obtained or pursuing a high school
 
05:16:07.730 --> 05:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
diploma or an equivalent certificate the
 
05:16:09.170 --> 05:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
court looks at none of this when it
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
automatically emancipates a minor just
 
05:16:12.948 --> 05:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
because they are married and as you
 
05:16:15.050 --> 05:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
heard as child marriage likely ends in
 
05:16:18.288 --> 05:16:18.298 align:start position:0%
divorce the child can then be abandoned
 
05:16:20.810 --> 05:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
and ill-equipped to support herself or
 
05:16:23.690 --> 05:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
the children she is likely to now have a
 
05:16:25.610 --> 05:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
child automatically emancipated through
 
05:16:28.010 --> 05:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
marriage and divorce before 18 may end
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
up homeless if her parents refuse to
 
05:16:31.490 --> 05:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
allow her back home
 
05:16:33.650 --> 05:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
additionally already emancipated
 
05:16:35.448 --> 05:16:35.458 align:start position:0%
children should not be allowed to marry
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's emancipation statute
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
allows children to petition the court
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
for an order granting limited
 
05:16:43.310 --> 05:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
emancipation to the youth however such
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
emancipation is intended to help
 
05:16:48.530 --> 05:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
children who cannot be reunited with
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
their parents by giving them some
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
limited rights of adulthood such as
 
05:16:55.310 --> 05:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
living independently managing their
 
05:16:57.470 --> 05:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
financial affairs and entering contracts
 
05:17:00.050 --> 05:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
it is unclear what other of any limited
 
05:17:02.090 --> 05:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
rights of adulthood are conferred like
 
05:17:04.610 --> 05:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
being able to file a protective order or
 
05:17:06.770 --> 05:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
having the ability to navigate a
 
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
contract as serious as marriage
 
05:17:12.530 --> 05:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
as stated domestic violence shelters
 
05:17:14.570 --> 05:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
typically also do not accept anyone
 
05:17:16.970 --> 05:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 and it's unclear how
 
05:17:19.128 --> 05:17:19.138 align:start position:0%
emancipation would affect that rule and
 
05:17:20.930 --> 05:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
imagine how a landlord might feel about
 
05:17:23.570 --> 05:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
renting an apartment to a 16 or 17 year
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
old even one who is emancipated and
 
05:17:28.128 --> 05:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
legally allowed to rent the apartment
 
05:17:30.770 --> 05:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
the law specifies also that an
 
05:17:32.810 --> 05:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
emancipated minor does not have the
 
05:17:34.368 --> 05:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
right to violate certain health and
 
05:17:36.890 --> 05:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
safety regulations relevant to the minor
 
05:17:39.230 --> 05:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
because of the miners age such as using
 
05:17:40.868 --> 05:17:40.878 align:start position:0%
or possessing tobacco or alcohol
 
05:17:44.330 --> 05:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
possessing firearms or gambling given
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
the serious risks to child's health and
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
safety that marriage poses which is an
 
05:17:51.890 --> 05:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
increase in the likelihood of a myriad
 
05:17:53.570 --> 05:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
of physical and mental health problems
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
as well as increased risk of living in
 
05:17:58.190 --> 05:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
poverty and being beaten The Logical
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that children also should
 
05:18:01.810 --> 05:18:01.820 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to be married
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
marriage before 18 brings devastating
 
05:18:08.270 --> 05:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
lifelong consequences for girls the many
 
05:18:10.730 --> 05:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
repercussions of child marriage do not
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
disappear if we stamp emancipated on a
 
05:18:16.128 --> 05:18:16.138 align:start position:0%
girl's forehead emancipated or not
 
05:18:19.128 --> 05:18:19.138 align:start position:0%
marriage at 16 or 17 is too dangerous
 
05:18:21.288 --> 05:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
and a child can wait to marry just as
 
05:18:23.390 --> 05:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
they would enter into any other contract
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I urge each of you to advance hb60
 
05:18:30.170 --> 05:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
and vote Yes for those reasons thank you
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%

05:19:49.850 --> 05:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for taking my
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is Sophia biando
 
05:19:54.530 --> 05:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
Lilo I'm 14. I live in Manchester and
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking today on behalf of the New
 
05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School Democrats in
 
05:20:00.170 --> 05:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
support of hb60
 
05:20:02.090 --> 05:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this bill because the
 
05:20:03.410 --> 05:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
marriage age in New Hampshire has been
 
05:20:05.570 --> 05:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
dangerously low for far too long
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
I remember when the marriage age was 13.
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
I remember thinking that it was absurd
 
05:20:10.970 --> 05:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
that I a child who could barely even
 
05:20:12.530 --> 05:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
manage getting my homework done could
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
make that sort of commitment to another
 
05:20:13.798 --> 05:20:14.750 align:start position:0%
make that sort of commitment to another
person

05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the fact is that keeping the
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
marriage age as low as it is is
 
05:20:18.770 --> 05:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
dangerous for Youth and is rooted in
 
05:20:20.690 --> 05:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
Traditions that should be long varied
 
05:20:22.490 --> 05:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
first of all most children who are at
 
05:20:23.868 --> 05:20:23.878 align:start position:0%
this stage in their life don't have a
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
lot of experience with this type of
 
05:20:26.930 --> 05:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
reasoning or decision making
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
according to Stanford Children's Health
 
05:20:30.050 --> 05:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
kids in their early adolescent
 
05:20:31.368 --> 05:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
development are just beginning to
 
05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
develop personal decision making skills
 
05:20:34.490 --> 05:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
and think about the future
 
05:20:36.170 --> 05:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
and this pivotal stage in their
 
05:20:37.128 --> 05:20:37.138 align:start position:0%
development I don't think it's
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
reasonable or fair to put this type of
 
05:20:41.090 --> 05:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
decision in their hands after all if a
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
16 year old can't be trusted to drive a
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
car drink alcohol Vote or buy a house
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
why should they be able to get married
 
05:20:49.010 --> 05:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
marriage is also a somewhat permanent
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
decision that can have long-term effects
 
05:20:51.590 --> 05:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
on the health of the person getting
 
05:20:52.910 --> 05:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
married according to the international
 
05:20:54.830 --> 05:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
Council of Defense of research on women
 
05:20:56.868 --> 05:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
sorry International Council of research
 
05:20:57.770 --> 05:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
on women
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
those who are married in their teen
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
years are at a much higher risk of
 
05:21:02.208 --> 05:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
becoming victims of domestic abuse and
 
05:21:04.850 --> 05:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
sexual assault the quality now which is
 
05:21:06.410 --> 05:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
an organization dedicated to ending
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
gender inequality and human trafficking
 
05:21:10.730 --> 05:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
says the girls married girls married as
 
05:21:12.350 --> 05:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
teens have higher risk for PTSD
 
05:21:14.030 --> 05:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
depression and certain heart conditions
 
05:21:16.490 --> 05:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
as well so not only is this decision one
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
that many minors aren't ready to make
 
05:21:19.010 --> 05:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's something that could affect them
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
longer to their adult lives
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
finally the idea of child marriage is
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
rooted in misogyny and hundreds of years
 
05:21:26.930 --> 05:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
of abuse in the past Marion young was
 
05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
often done out of a perceived economic
 
05:21:30.530 --> 05:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
necessity this meant that a majority of
 
05:21:32.270 --> 05:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
child marriages affected immigrants and
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
to this day most of the teens who get
 
05:21:35.690 --> 05:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
married in America are undereducated or
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
impoverished this so-called tradition
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
needs to be abolished and New Hampshire
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
needs to step forward and protect the
 
05:21:41.930 --> 05:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
youth in our state
 
05:21:43.850 --> 05:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I urge the committee to
 
05:21:45.288 --> 05:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
support this bill in order to protect
 
05:21:46.550 --> 05:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
those most vulnerable in New Hampshire
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
and treat our children with the respect
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.970 --> 05:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:21:57.230 --> 05:21:57.240 align:start position:0%

great seeing them thank you very much

05:22:18.250 --> 05:22:18.260 align:start position:0%
so we will go to
 
05:22:26.350 --> 05:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:28.190 --> 05:22:28.200 align:start position:0%

also a vocal National Advocate to end
 
05:22:52.250 --> 05:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
child marriage in the United States
 
05:22:53.990 --> 05:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
because of the horrors I had to endure
 
05:22:55.730 --> 05:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
as a child with absolutely no Escape
 
05:22:58.368 --> 05:22:58.378 align:start position:0%
legal or otherwise I hope that no other
 
05:23:00.110 --> 05:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
child must go through what I did and
 
05:23:03.050 --> 05:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
that is why I support hv60 I was forced
 
05:23:05.990 --> 05:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
into a marriage at 15 while visiting my
 
05:23:07.570 --> 05:23:07.580 align:start position:0%
father in California
 
05:23:10.010 --> 05:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
I was living with my mom at the time and
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
she didn't know what was going on
 
05:23:15.230 --> 05:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
um I was I was introduced to a man that
 
05:23:17.150 --> 05:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
morning who was 13 years older than me
 
05:23:20.208 --> 05:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
that night that man became my husband in
 
05:23:22.788 --> 05:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
a forced spiritual ceremony
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
six months later after being impregnated
 
05:23:28.850 --> 05:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
I was forced to legally marry him and it
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
took me eight long years of overcoming
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
enormous obstacles including physical
 
05:23:38.150 --> 05:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
abuse sexual abuse PTSD anxiety being
 
05:23:40.128 --> 05:23:40.138 align:start position:0%
taken out of school as a 15 year old and
 
05:23:41.930 --> 05:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
facing extreme poverty to be able to
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
leave this man
 
05:23:44.160 --> 05:23:45.410 align:start position:0%
leave this man
um

05:23:45.410 --> 05:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
05:23:46.798 --> 05:23:47.390 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry

05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:49.490 --> 05:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
I am not the exception
 
05:23:52.128 --> 05:23:52.138 align:start position:0%
I am actually the majority of miners who
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
marry we are three times more likely to
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
be abused in our marriages
 
05:23:58.850 --> 05:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
um where
 
05:24:00.708 --> 05:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
we're much more likely to be pulled out
 
05:24:03.410 --> 05:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
of school and face extreme poverty later
 
05:24:03.420 --> 05:24:06.350 align:start position:0%
of school and face extreme poverty later
on

05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.850 --> 05:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
we are
 
05:24:10.850 --> 05:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
at risk of having lifelong repercussions
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
that we have to face throughout our
 
05:24:12.718 --> 05:24:13.730 align:start position:0%
that we have to face throughout our
lives

05:24:13.730 --> 05:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
lives
 
05:24:16.250 --> 05:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
as a 15 year old I became pregnant right
 
05:24:18.770 --> 05:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
away I had two more children and I was
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
left with the responsibility of caring
 
05:24:22.550 --> 05:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
for my kids after eight long years of
 
05:24:24.410 --> 05:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
fine of finally getting out of that
 
05:24:24.420 --> 05:24:26.810 align:start position:0%
fine of finally getting out of that
marriage

05:24:26.810 --> 05:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's taken me years to recover from the
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
abuse and it's taken me years to get
 
05:24:34.368 --> 05:24:34.378 align:start position:0%
back to where my peers are as far as
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
education and finances I just recently
 
05:24:40.730 --> 05:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
graduated with a master's in 2019 that
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
said most most of my peers
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
um are just starting their families and
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
already have their careers ahead of them
 
05:24:51.050 --> 05:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
I am here
 
05:24:54.590 --> 05:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
um to really say that um on behalf of
 
05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
myself and for the people who can't be
 
05:24:58.850 --> 05:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
here to testify
 
05:25:01.550 --> 05:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
um I would urge you all to pass this
 
05:25:03.708 --> 05:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
bill because I can't think of any reason
 
05:25:05.810 --> 05:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
why New Hampshire would want to continue
 
05:25:08.330 --> 05:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
these harms and expose minors to a human
 
05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
rights abuse and um with that I I really
 
05:25:13.310 --> 05:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of you and all of your
 
05:25:16.128 --> 05:25:16.138 align:start position:0%

I was 16 when I was forced to marry
 
05:25:57.650 --> 05:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
while living in a cult in California
 
05:25:59.208 --> 05:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
and I need to give you a little bit of
 
05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
context around this
 
05:26:04.850 --> 05:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
I was my parents um that it's all
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
relevant to the story so I just want to
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
tell you just a little bit about me my
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
parents divorced at five and my mother
 
05:26:14.570 --> 05:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
remarried a man who started a cult
 
05:26:18.730 --> 05:26:18.740 align:start position:0%
and it had a culture of
 
05:26:18.740 --> 05:26:20.570 align:start position:0%
and it had a culture of
celibacy

05:26:20.570 --> 05:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
celibacy
 
05:26:22.930 --> 05:26:22.940 align:start position:0%
um of people
 
05:26:26.530 --> 05:26:26.540 align:start position:0%
marrying dominance over people
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I was adopted by my stepfather when
 
05:26:34.010 --> 05:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
I was 11 so my father lost all legal
 
05:26:36.410 --> 05:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
rights to me and he was unable to
 
05:26:37.970 --> 05:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
protect me
 
05:26:40.128 --> 05:26:40.138 align:start position:0%
I was pulled out of school in eighth
 
05:26:40.138 --> 05:26:41.208 align:start position:0%
I was pulled out of school in eighth
grade

05:26:41.208 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
grade
 
05:26:44.570 --> 05:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
and at 16 I fell in love with an 18 year
 
05:26:44.580 --> 05:26:45.830 align:start position:0%
and at 16 I fell in love with an 18 year
old

05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
old
 
05:26:45.840 --> 05:26:47.330 align:start position:0%
old
and

05:26:47.330 --> 05:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:50.208 --> 05:26:50.218 align:start position:0%
they did not approve of that because it
 
05:26:52.850 --> 05:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
was a secret relationship although I
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:58.610 --> 05:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
I was
 
05:27:01.030 --> 05:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
basically stripped
 
05:27:04.128 --> 05:27:04.138 align:start position:0%
in front this is just the punishment
 
05:27:06.288 --> 05:27:06.298 align:start position:0%
that they gave me I was confined to my
 
05:27:09.410 --> 05:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
room I was brought to community meetings
 
05:27:11.810 --> 05:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
where I was stripped to my underwear
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
with children watching
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
I was made an example of
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
I was shunned and ultimately I was
 
05:27:21.110 --> 05:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
forced to get married
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
and otherwise I would have been an
 
05:27:27.410 --> 05:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
outcast there I couldn't run away I was
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
a child
 
05:27:32.570 --> 05:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
and at 16
 
05:27:35.050 --> 05:27:35.060 align:start position:0%
I was forced to marry a 28 year old
 
05:27:39.830 --> 05:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
after an engagement of three days
 
05:27:43.128 --> 05:27:43.138 align:start position:0%
there were no questions by the clerk
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
there was no judge
 
05:27:47.690 --> 05:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
and then I was taken to the South
 
05:27:50.810 --> 05:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
Pacific for two and a half years
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
they took my passport
 
05:27:56.690 --> 05:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
it was statutory rape
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
I basically lost consent over my body I
 
05:28:02.090 --> 05:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
lost consent over my life
 
05:28:04.850 --> 05:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
my dad was told after the wedding that I
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
was married
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
and this man was obsessed with sex
 
05:28:15.530 --> 05:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
on the 4th of July 1984 when I was 19
 
05:28:17.090 --> 05:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
years old
 
05:28:21.770 --> 05:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
he showed some weakness about his being
 
05:28:21.780 --> 05:28:23.330 align:start position:0%
he showed some weakness about his being
um

05:28:23.330 --> 05:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:25.810 --> 05:28:25.820 align:start position:0%
basically being
 
05:28:30.170 --> 05:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
committed to the cult and I seized on
 
05:28:32.448 --> 05:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
this and I called his mother who lived
 
05:28:35.150 --> 05:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
in a nearby City and asked her if she
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
could help us and she delivered a car
 
05:28:40.250 --> 05:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
with the key on the tire
 
05:28:44.570 --> 05:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
I escaped that evening and with him and
 
05:28:46.430 --> 05:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
I went to see my father who I hadn't
 
05:28:48.650 --> 05:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
seen in 12 years
 
05:28:51.288 --> 05:28:51.298 align:start position:0%
the aftermath for me is I still have
 
05:28:54.350 --> 05:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
nightmares I'm 53 years old
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
I have mental health issues I've been
 
05:28:59.570 --> 05:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
through a lot of therapy I'm still in
 
05:28:59.580 --> 05:29:00.948 align:start position:0%
through a lot of therapy I'm still in
therapy

05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
05:29:04.430 --> 05:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a mother of a 16 year old that's the
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
age that I was married off
 
05:29:10.550 --> 05:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
she still likes stuffed animals
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
she's only been on one date and it was a
 
05:29:12.718 --> 05:29:15.050 align:start position:0%
she's only been on one date and it was a
picnic

05:29:15.050 --> 05:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:19.250 --> 05:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's emotional for me
 
05:29:21.530 --> 05:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
in the state of California you can't tan
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
until you're 18.
 
05:29:26.510 --> 05:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
in a tanning booth
 
05:29:28.850 --> 05:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
just a little relevance
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is not about religious freedom
 
05:29:35.690 --> 05:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's a child protection issue
 
05:29:37.850 --> 05:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
05:29:41.208 --> 05:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
the doors just kept closing for me I was
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
adopted I was married my passport was
 
05:29:47.208 --> 05:29:47.218 align:start position:0%
taken away I would have been a runaway
 
05:29:49.368 --> 05:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
if and I would have been returned to my
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
parents I had no options
 
05:29:55.850 --> 05:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
women in distress get help
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
children in distress married do not
 
05:30:03.530 --> 05:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
my story is actually a story of
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
resilience I became an international
 
05:30:08.930 --> 05:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
model at the age of 20.
 
05:30:11.448 --> 05:30:11.458 align:start position:0%
I got my master's degree
 
05:30:13.550 --> 05:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
and I have a thriving career in health
 
05:30:13.560 --> 05:30:14.510 align:start position:0%
and I have a thriving career in health
care

05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:30:16.250 --> 05:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
I am not
 
05:30:19.610 --> 05:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
the average child marriage Survivor
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for considering hb60 I urge
 
05:30:27.650 --> 05:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.868 --> 05:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:40.910 --> 05:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
next is oh yeah Abbas
 
05:30:47.770 --> 05:30:47.780 align:start position:0%

05:30:51.288 --> 05:30:51.298 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair rice Vice chair de
 
05:30:53.330 --> 05:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
Simone and distinguished committee
 
05:30:56.270 --> 05:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
members my name is Aaliyah Abbas and I
 
05:30:58.128 --> 05:30:58.138 align:start position:0%
am a child marriage Survivor and an
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
activist who will continue to fight
 
05:31:01.440 --> 05:31:02.990 align:start position:0%
activist who will continue to fight
until

05:31:02.990 --> 05:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
until
 
05:31:05.690 --> 05:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
my whole country is free of child
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
marriage as a child marriage Survivor I
 
05:31:11.150 --> 05:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
request you to vote Yes on bill hb60
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it simply will put an end to
 
05:31:16.128 --> 05:31:16.138 align:start position:0%
child marriage voting yes would mean
 
05:31:17.930 --> 05:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
eliminating the abuse of placing
 
05:31:20.930 --> 05:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
children in the most vulnerable hopeless
 
05:31:22.150 --> 05:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
and abusive
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
and excuse me abusive situations it is a
 
05:31:29.208 --> 05:31:29.218 align:start position:0%
fact that parental consent is most often
 
05:31:33.230 --> 05:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
parental coercion as was in my case
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
um even though in this state
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
um the marriage age is 18 but the law
 
05:31:42.050 --> 05:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
still permits 16 and 17 year olds to
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
marry with parental consent and
 
05:31:46.910 --> 05:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary approval and like I said in
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
most cases parental consent is Parental
 
05:31:50.280 --> 05:31:51.830 align:start position:0%
most cases parental consent is Parental
coercion

05:31:51.830 --> 05:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
the U.S state department has has called
 
05:31:58.190 --> 05:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
marriage below 18 a human rights abuse
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
and a human rights abuse is never in the
 
05:32:04.010 --> 05:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
best interest of a child even a more
 
05:32:06.350 --> 05:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
robust judicial review process would be
 
05:32:08.570 --> 05:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
dangerous it would put the child being
 
05:32:10.910 --> 05:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
forced to marry in the most terrifying
 
05:32:12.770 --> 05:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
position of choosing between being
 
05:32:15.530 --> 05:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
honest with the court or facing the
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
consequences at home
 
05:32:21.410 --> 05:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
um or lying to the court and I if I were
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
um to be put into that situation with
 
05:32:26.030 --> 05:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
the type of family that I grew up in I
 
05:32:28.250 --> 05:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
would be forced to lie
 
05:32:31.550 --> 05:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
um 17 year olds are at the highest risk
 
05:32:33.410 --> 05:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
of being forced into marriage because
 
05:32:35.810 --> 05:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
they are close to graduating from high
 
05:32:37.970 --> 05:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
school which is often when parents
 
05:32:39.890 --> 05:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
um worry that children will become too
 
05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
independent and will choose to marry
 
05:32:44.750 --> 05:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
them off I can I can attest to it being
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
that 17 year old child bride 18 years
 
05:32:50.930 --> 05:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
ago child marriage destroys girls health
 
05:32:54.530 --> 05:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
education and economic opportunities and
 
05:32:56.690 --> 05:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
increases their risk of experiencing
 
05:33:01.368 --> 05:33:01.378 align:start position:0%
further violence and Trauma between 2000
 
05:33:06.410 --> 05:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
and 2017 nearly 88 of child marriages
 
05:33:11.208 --> 05:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
were were of children aged 16 and 17. so
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
what does life look like for children
 
05:33:14.690 --> 05:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
who are who are forced into this abuse
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
to start off with the children who are
 
05:33:18.350 --> 05:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
forced um
 
05:33:21.890 --> 05:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh to to to endure this lifetime trauma
 
05:33:24.770 --> 05:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
of the forced marriage are are also
 
05:33:27.170 --> 05:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
likely to be pulled out of school
 
05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
um just as I was we know how important
 
05:33:33.890 --> 05:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
education is for children especially
 
05:33:36.350 --> 05:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
girls child brides are physically
 
05:33:39.230 --> 05:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
mentally and emotionally abused
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
um and manipulated
 
05:33:44.810 --> 05:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh also raped before they could gain the
 
05:33:47.448 --> 05:33:47.458 align:start position:0%
rights they need to escape at 18.
 
05:33:50.208 --> 05:33:50.218 align:start position:0%
um children child marriage excuse me
 
05:33:51.650 --> 05:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
puts the health and well-being and
 
05:33:55.010 --> 05:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
safety of children into Jeopardy 70 to
 
05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
80 percent of marriages before 18 and in
 
05:34:00.530 --> 05:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
Failure which puts children in such
 
05:34:04.190 --> 05:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
situations at risk of uh homelessness
 
05:34:06.788 --> 05:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
because they lack the financial
 
05:34:09.170 --> 05:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
Independence so what would we be really
 
05:34:11.090 --> 05:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
doing here other than putting the lives
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
of these children at risks
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
um to all sorts of uh Danger
 
05:34:19.368 --> 05:34:19.378 align:start position:0%
I wholeheartedly support this bill
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
because it hits home it's extremely
 
05:34:23.390 --> 05:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
personal I am a product of child
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
marriage and who better than a child
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
bride to know the reality of this
 
05:34:30.110 --> 05:34:30.120 align:start position:0%

05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
forever the first night of my marriage I
 
05:35:02.810 --> 05:35:02.820 align:start position:0%

fulfilling jobs I have but I will not
 
05:35:38.930 --> 05:35:38.940 align:start position:0%

can't even I can't even describe to you
 
05:35:57.890 --> 05:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
how much it took for me to when I came
 
05:35:59.628 --> 05:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
back here
 
05:36:02.990 --> 05:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
um three months after my marriage how
 
05:36:04.970 --> 05:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
hard it was for me to graduate high
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
school but I still did it
 
05:36:08.530 --> 05:36:08.540 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
I still held on to hope and to Faith and
 
05:36:14.510 --> 05:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
to God and I moved forward I was
 
05:36:16.810 --> 05:36:16.820 align:start position:0%
pregnant and I went to college
 
05:36:20.990 --> 05:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
I was you know I had my infant my first
 
05:36:22.550 --> 05:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
child and I took my child to college
 
05:36:25.610 --> 05:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
with me I went to work with my children
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
when the daycare would not accept them I
 
05:36:30.650 --> 05:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
was you know then I took both of my
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
children to my classes with me night
 
05:36:36.050 --> 05:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
classes so yes I went through college I
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
put myself through college but I took
 
05:36:40.610 --> 05:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
every ounce of me and I was only a child
 
05:36:43.788 --> 05:36:43.798 align:start position:0%
raising two children by myself I cannot
 
05:36:46.670 --> 05:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
describe to you the feeling
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
and the hardships that I went through
 
05:36:50.160 --> 05:36:51.110 align:start position:0%
and the hardships that I went through
um

05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
and a lot of child rides it's a fact
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
that they do not go through college they
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
do not they do not get to finish High
 
05:37:01.610 --> 05:37:01.620 align:start position:0%
School I don't know what it was but I
 
05:37:04.010 --> 05:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
kept pushing and I did not want to
 
05:37:06.410 --> 05:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
become that I did not want to become
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
part of the uh statistics
 
05:37:12.410 --> 05:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
but I I'm telling you I still don't know
 
05:37:15.890 --> 05:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
how I did it today
 
05:37:19.070 --> 05:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
and the marriage was you know full of
 
05:37:23.868 --> 05:37:23.878 align:start position:0%
abuse and when um I I totally forgot the
 
05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
name of the gentleman who spoke before
 
05:37:29.628 --> 05:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
when he talked about uh ownership I am a
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
very strong strong woman I'm gonna say
 
05:37:34.850 --> 05:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
that I do not let anybody own me the
 
05:37:39.610 --> 05:37:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:42.830 --> 05:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
my ex ex-husband who was 25 years old
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
thought that he did own me
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
I fought back
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the consequences was more meetings
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
more torture more rape more physical
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
abuse more mental abuse you know
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so while we may not think that hey
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
nobody owns us the the abuser does think
 
05:38:09.470 --> 05:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
that they do
 
05:38:12.530 --> 05:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't wish this experience for
 
05:38:15.530 --> 05:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
anyone I was bullied I was beaten I was
 
05:38:17.810 --> 05:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
raped I would just like to say one thing
 
05:38:20.690 --> 05:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
that I never Define myself as a victim
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
even though I have been been brutally
 
05:38:26.208 --> 05:38:26.218 align:start position:0%
victimized I'm a Survivor who had the
 
05:38:28.010 --> 05:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
courage to finally stand up for myself
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
and most importantly for the sake of my
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
children at any cost even when the cost
 
05:38:34.970 --> 05:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
was death as per my uncle because when
 
05:38:37.850 --> 05:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
we spoke about divorce my uncle said hey
 
05:38:41.150 --> 05:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
the women in our culture which is which
 
05:38:45.470 --> 05:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
is the Muslim Pakistani American culture
 
05:38:48.590 --> 05:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
um women are not they're they're not
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to get divorced but I still took
 
05:38:53.690 --> 05:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
the step knowing that I was going to
 
05:38:57.288 --> 05:38:57.298 align:start position:0%
risk death I took the step and I you
 
05:39:00.650 --> 05:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
know got myself out of it
 
05:39:03.590 --> 05:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
um that that is not the reality for a
 
05:39:05.570 --> 05:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
lot of girls who stay Within These
 
05:39:05.580 --> 05:39:07.610 align:start position:0%
lot of girls who stay Within These
marriages

05:39:07.610 --> 05:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
marriages
 
05:39:07.620 --> 05:39:08.750 align:start position:0%
marriages
um

05:39:08.750 --> 05:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:11.570 --> 05:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
I didn't know how to swim in a ocean of
 
05:39:13.490 --> 05:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
uncertainty but I took a huge risk
 
05:39:15.288 --> 05:39:15.298 align:start position:0%
toward my freedom and my children's
 
05:39:18.050 --> 05:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
freedom I taught myself how to swim with
 
05:39:20.090 --> 05:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
that uncertainty
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and it's still it's still a process
 
05:39:25.550 --> 05:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's a lifetime of healing it's a
 
05:39:28.670 --> 05:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
lifetime of trauma
 
05:39:32.090 --> 05:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately most child Brides do not
 
05:39:32.100 --> 05:39:33.708 align:start position:0%
unfortunately most child Brides do not
get

05:39:33.708 --> 05:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
um do not get the opportunity to get out
 
05:39:41.330 --> 05:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
of this situation and they abuse they
 
05:39:43.310 --> 05:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
experience a lifetime of abuse in all
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
forms of dehumanization torture
 
05:39:50.510 --> 05:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
um all types of abuse and sadly uh even
 
05:39:53.690 --> 05:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
death in some cases hb60 will simply
 
05:39:56.510 --> 05:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
will simply and child marriage and that
 
05:39:58.970 --> 05:39:58.980 align:start position:0%

05:41:24.170 --> 05:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
give up and it was going to keep coming
 
05:41:27.350 --> 05:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
back as will we until New Hampshire ends
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
child marriage
 
05:41:31.128 --> 05:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
uh you've heard some powerful testimony
 
05:41:33.470 --> 05:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
today on all the reasons that we need to
 
05:41:35.390 --> 05:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
end child marriage the harms and dangers
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
of marriage including at 16 and 17 the
 
05:41:40.128 --> 05:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
reasons the current law
 
05:41:42.650 --> 05:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
um is not sufficient the reasons that it
 
05:41:45.288 --> 05:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
should be 18 no exceptions when it comes
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
to marriage uh I want to touch on an
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
issue it's a question that comes up a
 
05:41:51.770 --> 05:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
lot we had Unchained have spoken with
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
many of you individually and a question
 
05:41:56.448 --> 05:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
that comes up a lot is what if a girl is
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant isn't she better off getting
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
married shouldn't she get married and so
 
05:42:02.208 --> 05:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
I just want to talk about that please
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear that there are only
 
05:42:06.410 --> 05:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
six U.S states that still allow a
 
05:42:08.510 --> 05:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to the marriage Aid a
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancy exception to the marriage age
 
05:42:13.310 --> 05:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
because what uh what legislative have
 
05:42:15.650 --> 05:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
legislators have realized is that
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
marrying off pregnant teenage girls is
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
terrible public policy and states have
 
05:42:22.368 --> 05:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
moved away from this in in fact most
 
05:42:24.530 --> 05:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
recently South Carolina and Ohio just in
 
05:42:28.670 --> 05:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
2019 Florida and Kentucky in 2018
 
05:42:30.170 --> 05:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
um have moved away from the pregnancy
 
05:42:32.208 --> 05:42:32.218 align:start position:0%
exceptions in their marriage age laws
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
and several states have passed
 
05:42:37.368 --> 05:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
legislation specifying that pregnancy is
 
05:42:39.830 --> 05:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
not enough of a reason to approve a
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
child marriage and here's why two main
 
05:42:44.690 --> 05:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
reasons first of all policy makers used
 
05:42:46.430 --> 05:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
to believe that a pregnant teenage girl
 
05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
was better off getting married and it
 
05:42:51.170 --> 05:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
turns out studies show that pregnant
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
teenage girls who stay single actually
 
05:42:55.730 --> 05:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
have better long-term outcomes than
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant teenage girls who marry
 
05:43:01.070 --> 05:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
for example married teenage mothers in
 
05:43:03.288 --> 05:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
the United States are 40 more likely
 
05:43:05.570 --> 05:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
than unmarried teens to give birth to a
 
05:43:08.030 --> 05:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
second baby within 24 months
 
05:43:10.010 --> 05:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
teen mothers who marry while they're
 
05:43:12.230 --> 05:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
pregnant are less likely ever to return
 
05:43:14.270 --> 05:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
to school than teen mothers who do not
 
05:43:16.128 --> 05:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
marry and that's really significant
 
05:43:19.368 --> 05:43:19.378 align:start position:0%
because we already know how uh how
 
05:43:22.128 --> 05:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
significant the child how significantly
 
05:43:24.350 --> 05:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
child marriage impacts
 
05:43:26.208 --> 05:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
um education you heard some of those
 
05:43:28.550 --> 05:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
statistics earlier and also teenage
 
05:43:30.410 --> 05:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
mothers in the United States who marry
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then divorce are more likely to
 
05:43:35.090 --> 05:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
suffer economic deprivation and
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
instability than teenage mothers who
 
05:43:39.170 --> 05:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
stay single and you heard again
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
repeatedly today that those who marry as
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
children are almost guaranteed to
 
05:43:46.368 --> 05:43:46.378 align:start position:0%
divorce 70 to 80 percent of marriages
 
05:43:50.090 --> 05:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
before 18 end in divorce
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
there are other really important reason
 
05:43:55.310 --> 05:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy that allowing uh pregnant
 
05:43:56.690 --> 05:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
girls to marry or Marigold pregnant
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
goals is is terrible public policy is
 
05:44:01.610 --> 05:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy exceptions of marriage
 
05:44:03.530 --> 05:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
age have been used to cover up rape and
 
05:44:05.690 --> 05:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
to force girls to marry their rapists
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
you heard from several survivors today
 
05:44:10.970 --> 05:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
who talked about their experience uh
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
being forced to marry their rapists and
 
05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is something that we had Unchained
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
we provide Direct Services and we have
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
seen this repeatedly is marriage used to
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
cover up rape and to force girls to
 
05:44:24.830 --> 05:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
marry their rapists uh pregnant teenage
 
05:44:28.490 --> 05:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
girls are at an increased risk of forced
 
05:44:30.650 --> 05:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
marriage this is what we have seen again
 
05:44:33.650 --> 05:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
and again and if a girl gets pregnant
 
05:44:35.448 --> 05:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
and she is from a family or community
 
05:44:38.030 --> 05:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
that views unwed motherhood as shameful
 
05:44:40.970 --> 05:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
she is at a significantly increased risk
 
05:44:43.910 --> 05:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
of a forced child marriage possibly to
 
05:44:46.670 --> 05:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
her own rapist a girl like that needs
 
05:44:50.150 --> 05:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
more protection not less protection and
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
I also want to make clear there's always
 
05:44:52.850 --> 05:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
a question that comes up about
 
05:44:55.128 --> 05:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
co-parenting well you know let's say
 
05:44:57.288 --> 05:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
they want to start a family and a girl
 
05:44:58.730 --> 05:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
is having a baby and wants that
 
05:45:00.890 --> 05:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
co-parent well guess what the father of
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
a baby who wants a co-parent can easily
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
do that outside of marriage all he has
 
05:45:07.010 --> 05:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
to do is establish paternity New
 
05:45:08.570 --> 05:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire makes it extremely easy like
 
05:45:11.448 --> 05:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
Most states to establish paternity and
 
05:45:13.010 --> 05:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
that way the baby would be covered under
 
05:45:14.810 --> 05:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
the father's health insurance and other
 
05:45:19.548 --> 05:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
benefits and a teenage girl could easily
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
co-parent without being entered into
 
05:45:23.030 --> 05:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
this serious contract of marriage with
 
05:45:25.430 --> 05:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
all the harms that it brings and and you
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
heard also how difficult it is for her
 
05:45:28.610 --> 05:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
to get out of that if she doesn't want
 
05:45:30.830 --> 05:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
it and also if the father does not want
 
05:45:33.410 --> 05:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
to co-parent the mother could still uh
 
05:45:34.788 --> 05:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
does not need a marriage license to get
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
relief she could still petition the
 
05:45:37.850 --> 05:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
court to establish paternity and to
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
enforce his basic obligation of support
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law provides for that and
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
besides think about how terrible the
 
05:45:45.890 --> 05:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
outcome would be if there's an you try
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
to force an unwilling father to
 
05:45:49.610 --> 05:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
co-parent by forcing him into uh into a
 
05:45:49.620 --> 05:45:50.868 align:start position:0%
co-parent by forcing him into uh into a
marriage

05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
also be very clear that the federal
 
05:45:56.690 --> 05:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
government and Most states no longer
 
05:45:59.270 --> 05:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
refer to a child born out of wedlock as
 
05:46:01.128 --> 05:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
illegitimate or treat such children
 
05:46:03.470 --> 05:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
differently and indeed New Hampshire law
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
states that if father's obligations are
 
05:46:07.788 --> 05:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
identical whether the child was born of
 
05:46:10.128 --> 05:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
unwed parents or in wedlock New
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law already establishes that
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
and think about it also if you want to
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that no child is born
 
05:46:18.650 --> 05:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
so-called out of wedlock then we would
 
05:46:20.330 --> 05:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
have to set the marriage age at the
 
05:46:22.128 --> 05:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
earliest age of puberty which is
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
approximately eight and could be even
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
younger and I think we can all agree
 
05:46:27.650 --> 05:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
that setting the marriage age at eight
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
is not what we want to see
 
05:46:34.368 --> 05:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
and so I um I just once again urge you
 
05:46:37.850 --> 05:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
to vote Yes on hb60 and end child
 
05:46:41.750 --> 05:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
marriage 18 no exceptions just it
 
05:46:43.010 --> 05:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if there is a pregnancy
 
05:46:45.890 --> 05:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
or not thank you
 
05:46:47.690 --> 05:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:46:47.700 --> 05:46:50.810 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

05:46:50.810 --> 05:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
see none thank you once again for your
 
05:46:53.400 --> 05:46:54.830 align:start position:0%
see none thank you once again for your
testimony

05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:46:57.530 --> 05:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have on my list and
 
05:47:00.048 --> 05:47:00.058 align:start position:0%

um married at 16 years old as well
 
05:47:42.948 --> 05:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
um I was no way at an age able to grow
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
into an independent person at 16
 
05:47:48.288 --> 05:47:48.298 align:start position:0%

um I did drop out of high school
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I married someone who was 12 years
 
05:47:56.150 --> 05:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
older than me it was a relationship that
 
05:47:59.868 --> 05:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
included control manipulation and abuse
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I also got pregnant at 16 a child
 
05:48:02.400 --> 05:48:04.128 align:start position:0%
um I also got pregnant at 16 a child
myself

05:48:04.128 --> 05:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
myself
 
05:48:06.770 --> 05:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
um and I got married in the state of New
 
05:48:06.780 --> 05:48:07.788 align:start position:0%
um and I got married in the state of New
Jersey

05:48:07.788 --> 05:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
Jersey
 
05:48:11.150 --> 05:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
a long story short my marriage did wind
 
05:48:13.548 --> 05:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
up in a divorce
 
05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
um and I also just want to say that I
 
05:48:17.810 --> 05:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
disagree with the fact that this is
 
05:48:20.208 --> 05:48:20.218 align:start position:0%
always parent coercion my parents didn't
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
coerce me I actually fell in love with a
 
05:48:26.090 --> 05:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
man that I Thought I Loved uh though my
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
parents didn't want to let the marriage
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
happen at such a young age I would have
 
05:48:33.410 --> 05:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
still ran away with him if they didn't
 
05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
agree to it so I just want to
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that and also I want to
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that parent coercion does
 
05:48:41.448 --> 05:48:41.458 align:start position:0%
happen and that's important to point
 
05:48:44.030 --> 05:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
that out I also want to point out the
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
response to one speaker saying that any
 
05:48:48.890 --> 05:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
relationship under 18 is manipulative
 
05:48:51.048 --> 05:48:51.058 align:start position:0%
it's important that we don't label
 
05:48:53.390 --> 05:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
people under 18 automatically in a
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
manipulative relationship because people
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
are going out with each other Who are 16
 
05:49:00.830 --> 05:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
and 17 years of age are all people under
 
05:49:04.190 --> 05:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
18 in a manipulative relationship no
 
05:49:06.350 --> 05:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
um but at the same time I think that if
 
05:49:08.770 --> 05:49:08.780 align:start position:0%
people are in love at such a young age
 
05:49:12.590 --> 05:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
below 18 they should just wait until
 
05:49:15.170 --> 05:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
they both are 18 before making the
 
05:49:18.590 --> 05:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
decision to get a legal marriage so I
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
support this bill hb60 because the
 
05:49:23.570 --> 05:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
possibility of coercion from parents
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes is possible it doesn't allow
 
05:49:28.250 --> 05:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
girls to grow into themselves because
 
05:49:30.310 --> 05:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're too busy taking care of families
 
05:49:33.770 --> 05:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
and for me my divorce like I had to go
 
05:49:35.448 --> 05:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
back to college and I only graduated
 
05:49:40.010 --> 05:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
four years ago I am 44 years old now
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so please do pass this bill because
 
05:49:43.670 --> 05:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't easy going back to school and
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
getting my life back on track and to
 
05:49:48.590 --> 05:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
also set the record straight I am a
 
05:49:50.510 --> 05:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
Muslim woman unfortunately someone said
 
05:49:52.430 --> 05:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
Muslim women can't get divorced which is
 
05:49:55.368 --> 05:49:55.378 align:start position:0%
false information but what is true is
 
05:49:57.170 --> 05:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
that some interpretations of the
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
religion make it so that some make it
 
05:50:01.490 --> 05:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
hard for women to be able to get a
 
05:50:03.590 --> 05:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
divorce but I needed to clarify that
 
05:50:05.448 --> 05:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
because I don't want my religion to be
 
05:50:07.730 --> 05:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
continuously stereotyped toxic
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
patriarchal practices happen in all
 
05:50:12.590 --> 05:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
cultures all religions all countries and
 
05:50:14.570 --> 05:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
so we need to work together to stop that
 
05:50:17.208 --> 05:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
so please do support this bill and pass
 
05:50:20.270 --> 05:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
it for our community's sake thank you
 
05:50:22.010 --> 05:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:50:22.020 --> 05:50:24.830 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:26.448 --> 05:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
being none
 
05:50:29.628 --> 05:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.948 --> 05:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair rice and

law race in the law and federal civil
 
05:50:58.190 --> 05:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
procedure I speak today in support of
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
hb60 to allow only adults aged 18 and
 
05:51:04.208 --> 05:51:04.218 align:start position:0%
over to Mary
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
I do not consider myself an activist
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
instead I research how legal measures
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
across a range of contexts affect
 
05:51:13.440 --> 05:51:14.750 align:start position:0%
across a range of contexts affect
adolescence

05:51:14.750 --> 05:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
adolescence
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
most relevant to today's hearing I
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
published an article on the marriage age
 
05:51:21.470 --> 05:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
in the 2012 edition of the Boston
 
05:51:23.570 --> 05:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
University law review
 
05:51:27.650 --> 05:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
as you've heard in too many cases minors
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
are coerced into marrying you've heard
 
05:51:33.310 --> 05:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
that miners particularly girls are
 
05:51:35.448 --> 05:51:35.458 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to this sort of coercion
 
05:51:37.970 --> 05:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
either by their prospective spouses or
 
05:51:40.190 --> 05:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
by a girl's own parents
 
05:51:41.990 --> 05:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
the importance of protecting children
 
05:51:44.270 --> 05:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
from the lifelong harms imposed by this
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
sort of coercion is almost too planned
 
05:51:47.868 --> 05:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
for words
 
05:51:51.470 --> 05:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm focusing today however on the high
 
05:51:54.490 --> 05:51:54.500 align:start position:0%
social cost of early marriage even when
 
05:51:58.510 --> 05:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
entered voluntarily as the last speaker
 
05:52:01.610 --> 05:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
noted and I'll try not to belabor some
 
05:52:03.048 --> 05:52:03.058 align:start position:0%
of the statistics that other speakers
 
05:52:05.810 --> 05:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
have shared with you
 
05:52:08.330 --> 05:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
um but as you as you've heard women who
 
05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
marry in their teens are more likely to
 
05:52:11.930 --> 05:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
drop out of high school less likely to
 
05:52:13.788 --> 05:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
finish college than those who delay
 
05:52:16.010 --> 05:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
marriage more likely to live in poverty
 
05:52:18.890 --> 05:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
than those who delay marriage uh Team
 
05:52:20.750 --> 05:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
mothers who marry between conception and
 
05:52:22.490 --> 05:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
childbirth are less likely to ever
 
05:52:24.770 --> 05:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
return to school than those who delay
 
05:52:27.650 --> 05:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
marriage I'd also like to emphasize for
 
05:52:30.770 --> 05:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
you that they are more likely to have a
 
05:52:33.170 --> 05:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
rapid second birth than teen mothers who
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't marry they're also more likely to
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
have more children overall both closely
 
05:52:41.868 --> 05:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
spaced births and having two or more
 
05:52:43.970 --> 05:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
children are associated with lower
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
educational attainment
 
05:52:49.970 --> 05:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh there are other social costs
 
05:52:52.190 --> 05:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
including psychological costs a study
 
05:52:54.110 --> 05:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
reported by the New York Times found
 
05:52:56.448 --> 05:52:56.458 align:start position:0%
that teen marriage was significantly
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
associated with mental disorders for
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
women particularly major depressive
 
05:53:06.410 --> 05:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
disorder it also correlates with worse
 
05:53:08.448 --> 05:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
physical health for women putting them
 
05:53:10.910 --> 05:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
at greater risk of heart attack diabetes
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
cancer and stroke
 
05:53:15.288 --> 05:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
now to quote the national marriage
 
05:53:15.298 --> 05:53:16.330 align:start position:0%
now to quote the national marriage
project

05:53:16.330 --> 05:53:16.340 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:53:19.190 --> 05:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
quote agent marriage is the strongest
 
05:53:21.410 --> 05:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
and most consistent predictor of marital
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
stability ever found by social science
 
05:53:26.930 --> 05:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
research end quote so we're all probably
 
05:53:28.850 --> 05:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
familiar with the statistic that nearly
 
05:53:31.910 --> 05:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
half of all U.S marriages end in divorce
 
05:53:33.650 --> 05:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
when we break that statistic down
 
05:53:35.868 --> 05:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
however we see consistently and over
 
05:53:38.448 --> 05:53:38.458 align:start position:0%
decades the following for individuals
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
who delay marrying into their mid-20s
 
05:53:44.090 --> 05:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
fewer than 30 percent will divorce when
 
05:53:46.730 --> 05:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
individuals marry before 18 as happens
 
05:53:49.490 --> 05:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire nearly 70 percent will
 
05:53:51.590 --> 05:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
divorce when children married at age 16
 
05:53:54.410 --> 05:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
as happens in New Hampshire nearly 80
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
percent will divorce I want to emphasize
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
as well that these rates of marital
 
05:54:02.448 --> 05:54:02.458 align:start position:0%
failure hold even when parents consent
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
to minors marriages and they hold even
 
05:54:07.970 --> 05:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
when judges consent
 
05:54:10.788 --> 05:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
delaying marriage by even a single year
 
05:54:13.490 --> 05:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
on the other hand significantly reduces
 
05:54:15.470 --> 05:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
the odds of divorce
 
05:54:17.810 --> 05:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
you might be wondering after all of this
 
05:54:20.810 --> 05:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
testimony why are the marriages of the
 
05:54:23.350 --> 05:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
young so unstable
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's a complex uh issue but it seems to
 
05:54:29.628 --> 05:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
roughly boil down according to research
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
to two factors the first is economic
 
05:54:35.330 --> 05:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
into the mid 20th century a young person
 
05:54:38.208 --> 05:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
didn't need to graduate high school in
 
05:54:40.670 --> 05:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
order to obtain a blue-collar job that
 
05:54:43.070 --> 05:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
paid a wage sufficient to support a
 
05:54:43.080 --> 05:54:44.390 align:start position:0%
paid a wage sufficient to support a
family

05:54:44.390 --> 05:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:54:46.670 --> 05:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
to earn a wage sufficient to support a
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
family in today's economy requires more
 
05:54:52.490 --> 05:54:52.500 align:start position:0%

the meaning of marriage has evolved over
 
05:55:20.990 --> 05:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
the centuries and decades today Mary

Carey marriage carries greater symbolic
 
05:55:27.410 --> 05:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
and personal value than ever
 
05:55:30.708 --> 05:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
we expect of our spouses a degree of
 
05:55:33.770 --> 05:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
relational intimacy and connection are
 
05:55:36.770 --> 05:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
greater than in the past
 
05:55:39.650 --> 05:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
today we no longer just expect a good
 
05:55:42.890 --> 05:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
provider For Better or For Worse we now
 
05:55:44.868 --> 05:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
expect a soul mate
 
05:55:46.610 --> 05:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
05:55:49.850 --> 05:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
today's marriages require mature
 
05:55:53.270 --> 05:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
relational capacities and these depend
 
05:55:56.208 --> 05:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
on a level of Psychosocial maturity that
 
05:55:58.850 --> 05:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
adolescents lack
 
05:56:02.690 --> 05:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh finally in closing
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we might ask why should we
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
care that most young people who marry
 
05:56:11.690 --> 05:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
than divorce because at least some of
 
05:56:14.090 --> 05:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
those marriages last right
 
05:56:14.100 --> 05:56:15.350 align:start position:0%
those marriages last right
well

05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:56:17.750 --> 05:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is why we should care
 
05:56:21.590 --> 05:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
marriage is arguably the primary social
 
05:56:24.410 --> 05:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
institution in the U.S
 
05:56:24.420 --> 05:56:25.070 align:start position:0%
institution in the U.S
um

05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire
 
05:56:29.470 --> 05:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's a civil status
 
05:56:33.048 --> 05:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
what it's created by the state when the
 
05:56:36.770 --> 05:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
state gives its stamp of approval it's
 
05:56:39.590 --> 05:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
saying this relationship is good for
 
05:56:41.628 --> 05:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
these individuals it's good for their
 
05:56:44.390 --> 05:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
families and it's good for our society
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
we encourage this
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
but as you've heard
 
05:56:53.330 --> 05:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
for these minors marriage is not a good
 
05:56:56.330 --> 05:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
it overwhelmingly hinders their
 
05:56:59.810 --> 05:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
well-being their future their ability to
 
05:57:02.330 --> 05:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
reach their potential and what they are
 
05:57:06.110 --> 05:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately able to contribute to society
 
05:57:08.930 --> 05:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
so underage marriage is also not good
 
05:57:11.170 --> 05:57:11.180 align:start position:0%
for broader Society
 
05:57:13.850 --> 05:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
for those reasons
 
05:57:13.860 --> 05:57:14.690 align:start position:0%
for those reasons
um

05:57:14.690 --> 05:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
I argue and hope that you will agree
 
05:57:20.510 --> 05:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
that our states should no longer
 
05:57:23.930 --> 05:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
sanction child marriage thank you so
 
05:57:27.048 --> 05:57:27.058 align:start position:0%
much for your time
 
05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much
 
05:57:35.930 --> 05:57:35.940 align:start position:0%

05:57:37.970 --> 05:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
raised their hand in the attendees list
 
05:57:41.330 --> 05:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
I would ask that any testimony you give
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
not be
 
05:57:43.680 --> 05:57:46.730 align:start position:0%
not be
um

05:57:46.730 --> 05:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:46.740 --> 05:57:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

um
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
an echo of of everything that we've
 
05:57:52.490 --> 05:57:52.500 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
06:17:14.690 --> 06:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
without objection we can put it on the
 
06:17:17.090 --> 06:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
06:17:23.868 --> 06:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:25.850 --> 06:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give the clerk a minute to
 
06:17:46.670 --> 06:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:46.680 --> 06:17:48.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:17:48.110 --> 06:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:51.110 --> 06:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
so if that session is when we vote on
 
06:17:55.610 --> 06:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
the the bills that we have so uh
 
06:17:58.490 --> 06:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
we just held the exact session for 4 27
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna do an exact session for
 
06:18:04.850 --> 06:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
um 254 and what we do is we make a
 
06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the house floor so it
 
06:18:09.170 --> 06:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
would go it will go in the calendar
 
06:18:12.110 --> 06:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
whoever makes the motion so for example
 
06:18:14.750 --> 06:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Al Schiller made the
 
06:18:17.090 --> 06:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
motion ought to pass as amended so
 
06:18:19.670 --> 06:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
she'll be writing the committee report
 
06:18:21.470 --> 06:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
not me
 
06:18:23.030 --> 06:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to like writing
 
06:18:25.730 --> 06:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
committed reports and that's what and if
 
06:18:26.810 --> 06:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
it had been
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
okay say that had been in the majority
 
06:18:30.830 --> 06:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
vote but but there was a minority
 
06:18:33.230 --> 06:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
someone else could write a Minority
 
06:18:33.240 --> 06:18:34.570 align:start position:0%
someone else could write a Minority
Report

06:18:34.570 --> 06:18:34.580 align:start position:0%
Report
 
06:18:37.788 --> 06:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
good versions of it in the calendar
 
06:18:41.750 --> 06:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
right but because this was unanimous and
 
06:18:44.330 --> 06:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a fiscal note it can go
 
06:18:46.548 --> 06:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar
 
06:18:50.030 --> 06:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar is at the beginning
 
06:18:52.310 --> 06:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
of our calendar at every house session
 
06:18:55.670 --> 06:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
we take one vote for the entire consent
 
06:18:59.208 --> 06:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
calendar now if there's a bill on there
 
06:19:00.890 --> 06:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
that you don't agree with and you want
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
to pull it off
 
06:19:04.310 --> 06:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
you can do that ahead of time you have
 
06:19:06.410 --> 06:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
to let the clerk know and then you can
 
06:19:09.288 --> 06:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
fight it on the house floor
 
06:19:12.288 --> 06:19:12.298 align:start position:0%
um but usually you know we'll put it on
 
06:19:13.850 --> 06:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
consent and it usually stays there
 
06:19:15.830 --> 06:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
unless there's something you know hugely
 
06:19:19.070 --> 06:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
unforeseen but so so that's what we're
 
06:19:20.990 --> 06:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
doing is
 
06:19:23.990 --> 06:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we're voting on these and and I chose
 
06:19:25.670 --> 06:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
these two today because there really
 
06:19:29.150 --> 06:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lot of discrepancy in the bills
 
06:19:29.160 --> 06:19:31.070 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lot of discrepancy in the bills
so

06:19:31.070 --> 06:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:19:34.730 --> 06:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
be an easy first time going through so
 
06:19:36.350 --> 06:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
if there's an amendment we move the
 
06:19:38.810 --> 06:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
amendment and then someone would
 
06:19:42.170 --> 06:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
um move on to pass as amended and then
 
06:19:45.048 --> 06:19:45.058 align:start position:0%
we vote on it and you know but and we'll

are you ready to vote Madam chair
 
06:21:22.548 --> 06:21:22.558 align:start position:0%

motion first okay
 
06:21:28.010 --> 06:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
so this was the um amendment that we had
 
06:21:29.448 --> 06:21:29.458 align:start position:0%
talked about that replaced the bill
 
06:21:31.610 --> 06:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
check out the Care Management entities
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
in it and just um helps to reduce the um
 
06:21:40.250 --> 06:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
the amount of kids being sent to the new
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
center we had done it a few years ago
 
06:21:45.470 --> 06:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
um at the time I was against that but
 
06:21:48.530 --> 06:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's been very successful we now have
 
06:21:50.868 --> 06:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
more Community Services out in the
 
06:21:54.470 --> 06:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
communities the funding has gone out so
 
06:21:56.930 --> 06:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I think it's it's safe to you know
 
06:21:58.490 --> 06:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
let's keep these kids back in their
 
06:22:02.270 --> 06:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
communities and um not in a prison
 
06:22:05.690 --> 06:22:05.700 align:start position:0%

06:26:17.580 --> 06:26:20.208 align:start position:0%
um
securely

06:26:20.208 --> 06:26:20.218 align:start position:0%
securely
 
06:26:23.570 --> 06:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh serving that that person you know
 
06:26:25.490 --> 06:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
whether it be protecting them or
 
06:26:27.350 --> 06:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
segregating them off from from other
 
06:26:31.128 --> 06:26:31.138 align:start position:0%
people or whatever the the reason may be
 
06:26:33.288 --> 06:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
there was some concern
 
06:26:33.298 --> 06:26:34.970 align:start position:0%
there was some concern
mentioned

06:26:34.970 --> 06:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
06:26:34.980 --> 06:26:36.830 align:start position:0%
mentioned
uh

06:26:36.830 --> 06:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:26:38.930 --> 06:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
about that and I don't feel that it's
 
06:26:42.650 --> 06:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:45.590 --> 06:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I have I got a list
 
06:26:47.690 --> 06:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
of some of the bill some of the
 
06:26:50.390 --> 06:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
potential things that may
 
06:26:52.850 --> 06:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
cause harm cause
 
06:26:52.860 --> 06:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
cause harm cause
conflict

06:26:54.830 --> 06:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
06:26:58.070 --> 06:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it would be best
 
06:27:01.670 --> 06:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
that this committee go into kind of a
 
06:27:03.770 --> 06:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
work session or something like that to
 
06:27:07.490 --> 06:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
address and make sure that all of these
 
06:27:07.500 --> 06:27:08.510 align:start position:0%
address and make sure that all of these
um
