um
 
00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.509 align:start position:0%
um
2024

00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
046 and let me just take a minute to I
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
second sorry thank you thank you let me
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
just take a minute to um ah here's
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
repres to to um explain what this
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
amendment does it incorporates into
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
1069 um what was in 1069 with an
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
exception that I'll talk about in a
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
minute um and what was in the original
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
1696 and the changes that it makes to
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
those two bills are that first it
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
changes the language
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
that appears I believe in two sections
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
of the current right to no law talking
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
about every citizen it changes that to
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
any person so that uh citizen there's no
 
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
longer any reference to Citizen it's
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
only any person um the second change
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
that it makes and it appears on page one
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is it it allows
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
for um it allows for the requester
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
to request
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
um uh the records in either electronic
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
or paper form and requires the
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
municipality or the governmental body to
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
to honor that request unless there's
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
some really good reason not to do so
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
like there's real a real concern about
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
security um uh it would be unduly
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
burdensome or the requestor has asked
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
for for the records to be provided in
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
electronic form in some format that the
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
that the governmental body doesn't keep
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have to then honor that um It
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
also says that um no charge can be made
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
for the electronic delivery remember
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
bear in mind we're talking about
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
delivery not the searching for the
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
records or that kind of thing but no
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
charge can be made for electronic
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
delivery uh but a charge can be made if
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
you for postage if you if you send it
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
out by by uh mail um so that's the major
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
change the other change that I think
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's important to to uh to point out is
 
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
and this representative I thank
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative tur for really raising
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
this issue because I I would have
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
glossed over it in the original 1069 the
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
change that it proposed was to say that
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
preliminary drafts circulated to a uh
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
Quorum or a majority of the public
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
body have to be provided the problem
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
with that is if that if those records
 
00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:00.550 align:start position:0%
with that is if that if those records
already

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
exist they're covered by the right to no
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
law and they have to be provided in
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
other words if you if a if a if a
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
governmental body receives a draft
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
report and and they keep that
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
report then they have and there's and
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
there's then a request made for for uh
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
Records they they they have to provide
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
that just like they provide the final
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
the final report that's a that's a
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
document that exists in the records of
 
00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:28.909 align:start position:0%
document that exists in the records of
the

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
of the public body but if we were to
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
pass this this would say that you have
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
to keep the draft report even though
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
you've made a final report so the the
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
the you know that's like with anything
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
else if you if if a if a member comes to
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
the uh to a meeting of a the board of
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and makes some notes um and
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
you know his or her his personal notes
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
whatever they don't have to keep that
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
they don't there's no
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of keeping records that are
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
sort of in draft form so this is so
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's what representative tur raised as
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
a as an issue and I think he's I think
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
he was right on that so this this
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
removes that um so anyway that's what
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
this does um questions on the on the uh
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
on the amendment all right I don't see
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
any I don't yes representative uh G
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
all right so this is amendment
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
no4

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
046

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
046
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
right this
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
is 1069 right all right um any any other
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions all right so I think for on
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment we can do it by a hand
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
in favor uh please raise your
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%

a distribut before
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
we sure so you may remember that we had
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
um representatives from the judicial
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
branch that testified about this and
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
they suggested a number of
 
00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:44.919 align:start position:0%
amendments main mainly it's to give more
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility if you will to the judicial
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
branch for um uh for example I I just
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
give you one big example the the
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
original Bill said there will be a
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
veterans court in every in every at
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
least one veterans court in every
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
District in a district court and a
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
superior court in every County the
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch added language that says
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm just giving just you a
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
quote here um in the Court's discretion
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
in counties or districts where
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
participation may be low or whether
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
other administrative conditions may
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
exist considerations may exist a
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
veterans court may be a track of an
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
existing mental health court may be
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
combined AC course across different
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
counties or districts May utilize a
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
virtual docket or may employ such other
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
flexible measures as the court May
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
determine appropriate in order to
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
effectuate the the objectives of this
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
statute um so it's designed basically to
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
give more
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility um it um the other thing was
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
that there were there were a couple of
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh places where um the uh uh oh I know I
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
know another change was made you
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
remember the discussion about about um
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
who was a veteran so um one of the
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
witnesses who testified right from from
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
the uh from the uh State adant office
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
wanted us to use RSA 2150 the definition
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
of veteran in there so I looked at that
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
the problem with 2150 is that statute is
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
basically designed to deal with veteran
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
benefits so it I'm not saying it
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
exclusively deals with that but it
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't it didn't seem to fit and so
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
just to give you an
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
example it would have it would limit it
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
limits the definition of veterans if I
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
recall to honorably discharged or
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
discharged with o discharged under other
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
than honorable conditions but not
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
dishonorable discharge and my concern is
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
that remember what we're talking about
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
here we're just we're trying to provide
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
sort of special help to somebody who has
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
who who has a condition arising out of
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
their service so it seems to me and
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
again it's obviously whether somebody
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
qualifies or not is up to the court but
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
it seems to me we don't want to flatly
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
Prelude somebody that was uh
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
dishonorably discharged for example
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
suppose somebody was in a com you know
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
was in a combat theater they became drug
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
addicted they got dishonorably
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
discharged because they committed some
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
crime while they were in the service and
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
they still consider they still continue
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
to have some problems I don't think we
 
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
want to say that those people are you
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
know just as a blanket matter could not
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
be considered for the veterans court
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe the judge will say no for
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
whatever reason but they should at least
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
should be open to them so that's what uh
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
that's um why why that change was made
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
the I'm sorry yeah especially
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that the drug court
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
would be open to anybody regardless of
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
their service history right exactly
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
exactly that's the benefit extend here
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
the other language that I uh put in here
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
that the um judicial branch proposed to
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
change and I believe this is right and
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on my my I spent one
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
term in finance but my colleague uh the
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
ranking member spent more than that um
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
the language was changed because of by
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch because the way it
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
was originally worded it would have
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
required um it it it could have been
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
read to say that um there was a
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
requirement to to provide to apply for
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
federal grants that could be used to
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
offset state grants and my recollection
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
for my short time in finance is you
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
can't do that the feds will not give you
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
the money if you say you're going to use
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
it to displace what the state would have
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise spent bent you can supplement
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
with Federal money but not replace and
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
so that language was put in there the
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
fancy word is suppliant supplant that's
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
it so so that's so this is this change
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
was made uh for that reason um I you
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
know there's probably a couple of other
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
little things but what I would say is
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
this I looked line by line at the
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
amendment um that that was provided by
 
00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:25.310 align:start position:0%
amendment um that that was provided by
uh

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
OS um to this and and it and to make
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
sure that it Incorporated all the
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
changes that I had requested based upon
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
what the what the uh uh uh the judicial
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
branch had had uh requested and they are
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
in here the changes the changes are in
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
here um there there you know I might
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
have I might have made some
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
non-substantive tinkering with the
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
language a little bit but there was no
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
substantive change from what the
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
judicial branch had requested questions
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative CH then
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative gree yeah just one other
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
comment another significant change that
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
I think was made was narrowing the scope
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
of military contractors which was wide
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
open before and is now says I believe
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
that they have to serve in a in a in a
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
combat theater or something along those
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
lines right no that's true because one
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
of the things that you may remember from
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor representative maet he
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that contractors
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
could be covered um but I think I think
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
what we didn't want to have happen is
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
you know somebody that somebody that's
 
00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
you know somebody that somebody that's
uh

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh works for Lockheed Martin or
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
something and all they've and they've
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
just worked in the Pentagon as a as a
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
civilian never you know set foot
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
anywhere in a combat area I don't think
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
we want to cover I don't think we want
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
to consider them as somebody that's
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
covered so this limits it to combat
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
theater representative
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
grion an additional uh issue that was
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
brought up about qualification it would
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
be a current or former me military
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
member of a foreign Allied country um I
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
know I would not support that um the
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
changing the language of the contractor
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
uh is is is fine but this the in reading
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
the definitions of a veteran you are
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
actually eliminating anybody who's been
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
discharged from service because it says
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
a member of the active or Reserve
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
components of the United States Army
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
United States Navy etc etc or a member
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
of the national uh New Hampshire
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
National Guard those are active no no
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
this this have you got the right this
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
says a a a current or former a current
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
member no that's that's in the amendment
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
that's in the amendment right okay
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's why that's that that
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
that was I I'm I'm sorry I didn't
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
specifically cover that was in the I
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
made that change because of that very
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
issue the original Bill did not would
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
not have covered that so that's why I
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
put that language in a current or former
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
member and it that's the same with
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
current or former member of the new H
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard a current or
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
former contractor of the United States
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense who served in a
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
theater of armed
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
conflict um so that I think that
 
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.710 align:start position:0%
conflict um so that I think that
covers

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
covers
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um other other
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
questions yes I have an email from umen
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
K yeah that the executive
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
session6 that well I I had her put that
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
in okay in case we couldn't get this
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
done today that was going to be the
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
alternative as we'd meet on Tuesday we
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
will can't if we get through the the
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
agenda today we will cancel that there
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
will be no meeting on Tuesday okay all
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
Andrews somebody has a dishonorable
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
discharge are they included in this they
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
would they yes they could be covered by
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
this that's they don't that's not to say
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's not automatic it's up to the judge
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%

right uh representative Smith do you
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh well the direct answer to your
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
question is no I
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't um however what I will say is that
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
I think that the
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
um this gave us a very interesting
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear more about two uh
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
disperate And I stress that disperate um
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
entities that we come in contact with
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
here in the uh judicial branch and um uh
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
I think on the basis of the testimony
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
both written and oral that was presented
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
and our evaluation of the bill um I
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
think it's safe to conclude that um
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
there there would be significant uh uh
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
costs not necessarily dollar costs but
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
programmatic costs and no real benefits
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
to combining the two all right anyone
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on representa trip
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
I would I would have to agree I think
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
the the uh the hab is uh uh still
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
maturing and that uh giving them any
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
more duties would be a
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh a detriment to
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
that in stage you know and I I think
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
that uh if if they were given new duties
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
without the uh necessary experience and
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they they might air so I would
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
not uh recommend the hab taking on any
 
00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:14.069 align:start position:0%
not uh recommend the hab taking on any
new

00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
duties uh other comments so I would just
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
say very briefly that I agree with uh
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
with what the two comments that have
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
been made by uh representative Smith and
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
the at some point in you know in the
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
future maybe it would make sense to do
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
this but I think we need to see how the
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
hab is working out particularly when we
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
now have the new uh uh land use stocket
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
in the superior court I think it makes
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
much more sense not to do anything now
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
and to itl this bill anyone else have
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
anything to say about uh
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
1651 all right uh I guess we're ready
 
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:57.880 align:start position:0%

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
toight okay that's fine point I will at
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
some point in the foreseeable future not
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
fine all right um
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
1602 that's the bill dealing with the
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
appell jurisdiction of the housing
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
appeals board and we're as we discussed
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
last time I think it we we really need
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
to hold off on this I think particularly
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
until we hear House Bill 1614 which is I
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
think scheduled for the 14th I'm okay
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
voting today if you want it's a great
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill I will you representative Alexander
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be sast to call for
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
vote that's 1602 we're yeah we're
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
holding off um the next uh bill is uh
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1256 establishing liability
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
for Publishers and Distributors of
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
Internet material harmful to
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
miners um do I have a motion on
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
that um representative Wallace Do you
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
a motion what was the that's 1256 that's
 
00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:03.069 align:start position:0%
a motion what was the that's 1256 that's
the

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh liability for Publishers and
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
Distributors of Internet material
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
harmful to minors yeah it right is there
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
a second I'll I'll
 
00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
a second I'll I'll
second

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
um uh represent Wallace do you want to
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
speak to that or do you want me to speak
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
to I'm happy feel free I'm taking notes
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
so okay no that's fine beat the CL so I
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is a bill you may recall that um it
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
would EST it would
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
require uh orn sites for lack of a
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
better term to have uh requirements that
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
you that miners have to
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
provide they can't just sort of click on
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
I'm yes I'm under 18 they have to
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
provide like documentation a uh a
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license or some other kind of
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
documentation um digital certificate
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
digital certificate I think is the way
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
it was referred to and the as you may
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
recall there were questions raised by
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
the ACLU and I think some others um
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
um oh oh okay I'm yeah there we go about
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill under as possible violation
 
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
of the First Amendment and you I have to
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
say I there although I might on the I
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
might disagree with that with that
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
assessment it's certainly not a
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
frivolous one and there would be
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
litigation over that um which is that in
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
itself would not be enough for me not to
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
support it but the more important thing
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
to me uh for not supporting it is this
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
this bill the the remedy that this bill
 
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.109 align:start position:0%
this bill the the remedy that this bill
provides

00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
provides
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
for um for uh violations of the bill is
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
a is a civil action for
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
damages it doesn't say in the bill I
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
think this is really a glaring week who
 
00:42:15.069 --> 00:42:15.079 align:start position:0%
gets to bring the civil action but if
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
even if you assume it you know it's
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who would somebody who would
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
claim to be damaged I guess that's
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
probably a fair way of reading it the
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
the real problem is this it's
 
00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
what what that's going to mean is you
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
you have to buy into the
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
idea that okay my you know 14-year-old
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
son or daughter uh looked at pornography
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
on the internet that was uh where they
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have the proper
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh Pro you know they didn't provide the
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
proper proof that they were over 18 and
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of that harmed some did did
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
what har you know turned into a serial
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
killer did uh did uh some other bad
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
thing what how are you going to prove
 
00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:05.079 align:start position:0%
that how what's going to be the proof I
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know I to it really seems to me that
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
this opens the door to a lot of junk
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
science well yes I'm an expert I got you
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
know five degrees and I say the fact
 
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
that this person looked at
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
pornography uh every day for two years
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
me meant that they killed that they
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
turned into a serial killer or they did
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
it you
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
know from my own experience you can get
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
an expert to say anything you can if you
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
have AA you want to try to get a case
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
you can find an expert who will say
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's true and you'll find
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
another expert on the other side but do
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
we really want to you know open that
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
door in this kind of case wouldn't it be
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
better if we in some future time maybe
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's a better remedy maybe it would
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
allow the AG to bring some kind of an
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
action or for some civil penalty I don't
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
know but I I guess my bottom line is
 
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
there's enough problems with this bill
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
that I think it makes sense to itl
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
it representative Wallace thank you
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
additionally just the implementation uh
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
of this is practically impossible if you
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
think about um a virtual private Network
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
even if this would have become a statute
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
there is no way to enforce it because
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
you know kids are smart um they know how
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
to use the internet and whatnot and
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
they'll probably have their own VPN set
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
up and their IP will broadcast that
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're in uh you know usbekistan
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
someplace or Taiwan was going to e
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
Taiwan out of it but uh in any case it
 
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult even if we had
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
some type of a digital certificate
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
requirement in this country because you
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
can project an IP address of any address
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
on the planet and it's just technically
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
unenforceable other yes representative
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
gson I wouldn't make light of the
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
addictiveness of pornography its
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
horrible impact on our society and on
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
the ease of availability to children and
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
what it does to their to their minds
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
growing up if you go to a a prison and
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
you ask inmates who are especially the
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
ones who are in there for child pred uh
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
predation charges you will find that
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
that pornography use and exposure
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
especially over a prolonged period of
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
time is a very common denominator
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
affecting their behavior and their
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
attitudes ask anyone who's in prison
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
because they beat up their woman and
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
you'll find out that you that
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
pornography use was prevalent in their
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
lives so making light of it is very
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
offensive first of all and to dismiss
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who would who would uh uh make
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
any kind of a reference well you can
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
find an expert to say anything I can
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
find a judge to say anything too that
 
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.230 align:start position:0%
find a judge to say anything too that
being

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
said this bill does have problems but
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a First Amendment issue because
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
every other amendment to the
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution requires some kind of
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
verification or anything like that if I
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
want to go and purchase a pistol I have
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
to show my ID not only do I have to show
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
my ID I have to go through a background
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
check all that's required here is an age
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
verification that you're not under 18
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
years of age no one is stopping the
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
production of it no one is stopping the
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
the the publication of it no one is
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
stopping the viewing of it they're just
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
saying if you're under 18 you don't need
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
to be looking at this stuff and we're
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to prevent you from looking at it
 
00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
if you're not willing to prevent
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
children from accessing this stuff I
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
think you've got the problem all right
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
other comments on this uh yes
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
Perez I've been fighting the Sora ab app
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
00:46:41.839 --> 00:46:43.349 align:start position:0%
in schools
for

00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
months because it is an app that the
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
schools use for middle school and high
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
school kids that they can start out and
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
move themselves anywhere they want to
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
move themselves to
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
and they can move themselves to
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
pornography and as much as the school
 
00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
has showed me that oh we blocked that I
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
have taken high school kids and said
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
okay here's the app now show me and they
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
show me how they use the app in school
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
and go wherever they want I agree that
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
we need
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
something something I agree that parents
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
and children should be
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
accountable but they're not and a a lot
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
of parents have the attitude well they
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
can just go on the internet and find it
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
anyway what difference does it make it
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
does make a difference it does make a
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
difference because we have a lot of
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
young people who I mean this is
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
different than when you had Playboy
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
stuck under your mattress I mean this is
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
hardcore hardcore pornography we are
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
talking about not just girls
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
in little bit things I think this bill
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
needs needs to be worked I think we do
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
have a problem I think this has been a
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
problem for a long time it's like our um
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
AI bill that we talked about we didn't
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
nip this in the bud we didn't nip this
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
in the bud and I feel that we maybe need
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
to look at this perfect it more and come
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
out with a way that somebody is held
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
accountable because kids will be
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
kids parents are busy somebody needs to
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
be held accountable for this stuff being
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
out there and as I say this is not
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
Playboy magazine that you used to get in
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
a brown bag you couldn't even get
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
it if it wasn't in a plain bag so
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done about the
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
pornography out there and the children's
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
access to it my thoughts other
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
comments so I I guess the fin the only
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
thing I would say finally on this is I I
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with with the idea that
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
something ought to be done my
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
concern is that if for example and let's
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
say next you know next year a bill was
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
offered that said if you do you have to
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
Distributors such as pornhub or whatever
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
they have to they have to implement a
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
system like this but it's the attorney
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
general for example that gets to enforce
 
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
it and there's a civil penalty if you do
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
it that will limit Ates this whole you
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
know whether I'm right or you're right
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
representative gon on that whether
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
there's really a connection that can
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
that can be solidly verified between uh
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh viewing pornography and doing some
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
other bad thing um you could eliminate
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
that whole issue if you had if you if it
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
was a criminal penalty would simply say
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
if you do this if you allow somebody to
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
get on get access to your network
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
without providing the appropriate
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
documentation it doesn't matter whether
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
they whether somebody was armed or not
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
you're not you're it's against the law
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to do it and there's
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
some penalty that's uh that's imposed
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
that I think uh you know cuts out this
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
whole issue of we would have a debate
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
about so that's um that's something for
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
the future but right now um anybody else
 
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
want to speak on the itl motion on 1256
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
Mr share yes uh thank you thank you for
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question you know I think that
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
um we're making or the suppor of the
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill or the author of the bill um made
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
assumptions that different different
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
items or different issues push result in
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior or whatever but
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
there's no science behind it to prove
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
that so we need like we need
 
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.630 align:start position:0%
that so we need like we need
data

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%

let's and I apologize for for for this
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
um but let's go back to the veterans
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
court Bill 1589 does everybody have the
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment and you know what I
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't maybe somebody who's got
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
more experience than me can can uh
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
explain this
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
I it's not I I guess if I'm I and I
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
should have really asked somebody from
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
OS um what I did when I sent OS the
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
amendment is I sent I basically I I
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
asked I sent to OS please send me a word
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
copy of the
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
bill um so that I can then make an amend
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
I can then sort of edit it and make a
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
new you know send you a a whole new bill
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
with the new language and I'll put the
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
language in bold or you know strike
 
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
through whatever and they did they did
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
that they gave me a word copy of the
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
bill and I then sent them back the
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
amendment um I I can only assume that
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
they must have a procedure that says
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
they will use they will
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
make they will use the least words
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
possible in their amendments I think
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
that's probably it because they the
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
amendment they sent back is you can't
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's not the full bill you have to read
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
it in connection with the full
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
Bill and I've had that happen before and
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
I should have talked to him but anyway I
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
went through and read all read it to
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that it actually made sense
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
and it covered everything and in fact I
 
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
found one uh there this is this one is
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
actually the second version of the
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment because there was one error
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
they missed one word in the in the
 
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
original one and I said please you know
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
I F I found this will you please make
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
the change and they did and so this is
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
the this is the one this is the final
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
one uh that is that is right um I've
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
checked it and it is correct um and it
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
makes the changes that were we discussed
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
previously so
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
um is there um is there any further
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment to uh House
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 1589 it's Amendment
 
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:48.150 align:start position:0%

or former military member of a foreign
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
Allied country is still in this and I
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
cannot support
 
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.470 align:start position:0%
cannot support
that

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay any other any other comments
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
on on uh on the amendment that was in
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
the I believe it minute hang on I'll
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.750 align:start position:0%
 
minute

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
me yes it is in the uh it is in the
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.470 align:start position:0%
original bill
yeah

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
yes it seems strange but how did this
 
00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:02.839 align:start position:0%
get in here um was there some further
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
idea or qualification that you know a
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
current a former um military member that
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
maybe have become a citizen since that
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
action well you know what it could you
 
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
know what it could remember we heard
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
some testimony about um you know for
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
example a the you know Afghanistan or
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
Iraq or something it I it it could be
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
that you would have people that were the
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
interpreters you know maybe they be
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they were some of those people
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
were uh in the military in in
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan those were specifically
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
contractors that were mentioned when we
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
were discussing DOD contractors that
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
served in combat the the translators and
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
the interpreters were contractors not
 
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
foreign military members well I'm not
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
sure that it was limited to that I mean
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
I certainly agree that there were their
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
contractors were referred to but I mean
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
I guess I to me is the if you had
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
somebody that was um well for example so
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know let's take uh let's take what's
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
going on now in the in the Red Sea area
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
suppose that you know a a a former
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
member of the of the military from the
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
United Kingdom is uh um is in some kind
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
of combat operations there maybe in the
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
Air Force or something or attached to a
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
mission or right or attached to a
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
mission and um comes to the you know
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
event and after that service comes to
 
00:57:35.549 --> 00:57:35.559 align:start position:0%
the United States is traumatized by that
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
service in one way or another and gets
 
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
in some trouble I would think that that
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
person ought to be at least eligible to
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
be considered for the veterans court now
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
maybe that maybe the judge will say you
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
know in your particular circumstances
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't I'm not going to
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
treat you that way but I would think
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
that I don't I wouldn't I would think we
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
would not want to as a
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
as a blanket matter say you're you're
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
ineligible but it seems to need some
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
further qualification it just standing
 
00:58:07.789 --> 00:58:07.799 align:start position:0%
out there alone um we can make up or or
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
look in and understand that there are
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances of attached mission of
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
foreign troops into under our Command
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
and um they're injured going to a
 
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
military hospital we take care of them
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
they even come to the United States um
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
but but there's no qualification here
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
kind of just leaves it open um
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
and you know could anybody put a claim
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
in uh who who come to the country and
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
didn't serve in those circumstances on
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
attached Mission or coordinated Mission
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
system yes sure would it make sense to
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
say that the it at least qualify that
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
that person has to be a current US
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
citizen or like a legal resident in that
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
it's not somebody that's just here
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
visiting like on a vacation that's
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
this yeah I mean I yeah I think we could
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
we could do that I guess the the thing
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
the thing that I'm
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'm that gives me some pause about this
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
is that we're
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
just we're just saying that this whoever
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
the covered people are are people who
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
who in the discretion of the Court may
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
qualify to get the sort
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
of benefits if you will of the um of
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
this of this program and I'm not I I
 
00:59:47.799 --> 00:59:49.029 align:start position:0%
this of this program and I'm not I I
guess

00:59:49.029 --> 00:59:49.039 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure why that why that we
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
would want to blanketly exclude those
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
people that's but with um just a
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
question with reference to our current
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
and existing drug courts uh and the
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
program here in uh in New Hampshire
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a uh so somebody from the UK
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
who's here maybe a student or something
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
like that gets into some difficulty with
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
drugs wouldn't they be eligible to take
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
advantage of the uh treatment and
 
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
processing through the drug court as I
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
understand it yes I mean I don't think
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's any as I as far as I know
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
there's no I don't think there's even a
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
qualification of like C question differ
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
in this situation and so the followup
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
question would be why would that be any
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
different than a foreign member of
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
service who happens to be here and gets
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
into some difficulty um they may still
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
have that PTSD uh lurking and being a
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
trigger uh representative Smith then
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you um am am
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
I incorrect I thought that in any event
 
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.390 align:start position:0%
I incorrect I thought that in any event
the

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
judge um has the discretion in every
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
case to decide
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility am I wrong about that think
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's that is my understanding
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
that the judge has the discretion yes
 
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.870 align:start position:0%
that the judge has the discretion yes
representative

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
Perez I apologize because I was not here
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
for the hearings but I did read this
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
well not this one but the one before I
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
think we're leaving out a whole group of
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
people we're allowing contractors but we
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
have a whole group of people that helped
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
us in Afghanistan who were not part of
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
our military who unfortunately a lot
 
01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
were left behind but the interpreters
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
and all of those people they're totally
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
left out of this um I just think that
 
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
this is it's it's limiting by Omission
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
people that we might also want to
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
consider because just because I wasn't a
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
veteran or a
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
contractor but I was serving by our side
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
and helping us
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
win if we can get them here shouldn't
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
they be eligible as well I think they
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
are contractors as I understand it those
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
people that are acting as interpreters
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
were all acting as interpreters under a
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
contract with okay thank you I I didn't
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
know that and thank you I stand correct
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
I think the way the Bill's written that
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
disc uh representative orgon well
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
limiting it to non-citizens would
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate well first of all some people
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
from category a since right these
 
01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
services do allow non-citizens as long
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
as he can speak English have at least a
 
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
green card you can get in obviously the
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
contractors can be from any country and
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
then um D I think that's reasonably uh
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
reasonably clear the judge anyway has
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
discretion as he said but certainly
 
01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839 align:start position:0%
would I would I assume that would at
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
least cover like people who serve with
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
other in other NATO countries militaries
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
or for other alliances that we belong to
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't think this limiting the
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
citizens is a is a uh I I think that
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
weakens the bill but representative
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
trip um I have to agree with rep rep
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
Stapleton because the way it's written
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
right now uh you could have the Taliban
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
or Isis applying for this program says
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
all Alli no it says a current or foreign
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
military member of a foreign Allied
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
country all right well wasn't uh the
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
Taliban an ally at one point in time
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
when we were fighting
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
comments all right right anybody any any
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
further comments all right are we ready
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
for Mr chair
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't it be a better idea to start
 
01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:52.039 align:start position:0%
out you know plain vanilla and then
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
after the program gets off at feet to
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
people so I I'm guess I'm not what what
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
would be pling vanel that's that's
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
what US military Veterans Preference um
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
and then you know maybe later on the
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
contractors in
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
translators after the program gets off
 
01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:19.870 align:start position:0%
translators after the program gets off
the

01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.670 align:start position:0%
the
ground

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
ground
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay what any other comments yes so if
 
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
it passed like this would the court be
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
able to possibly establish like you know
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
a preference to um current active or
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
retired US veterans like even if it
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
passed this way could they still start
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
off in a vanilla way as rep De Lorenzo
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh suggested um could the court still
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
just prioritize you know who they were
 
01:04:51.309 --> 01:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
weren't going to accept since the judge
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
would have the discretion and the
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
it could sure I think I mean I think
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's true I suppose if the
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
my if the if it turned
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
out that I would think that the drug
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
court was sort of overloaded there were
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
too many PE you know there were more
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
people that wanted to do this than the
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
than the court had facilities or judges
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
or whatever to do it I I'm I'm sure they
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
would have to prioritize and I I mean
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
that might I would if I were a judge I
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
think I would you know and I had and I
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
had uh I had to choose between somebody
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
who was an American serviceman or
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
somebody that was a foreign person
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have enough room I I
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
would very likely choose the American
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
unless there were some really you know
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
amazing reason to to not choose the
 
01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:45.799 align:start position:0%
American but um you know I don't know
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
whether that would be the case or not we
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people would likely
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
you know end up in the veterans court
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
program representative
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
sabl yeah
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
discernment is great to be expected but
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a hole in the law
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
some people jump through it and even
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
judges have to acques to sometime that's
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
written in statute even if they don't
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
agree with it um I I would have liked to
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
see um a current or former military
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
member of a foreign Allied country who
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
was attached to or under the command of
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
US forces in a combat theater
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
a qualification like that or something
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
similar would make this much more
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
palatable um instead of just an open
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
unqualified statement like it is all
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
right other early Bill uh this is an
 
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
early bill this is an early Bill yes yes
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
uh that one line to me needs to be
 
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
cleaned up somehow and unless it is I
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
can't support the
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
comments All right so are we ready for a
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment vote on the
 
01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:09.349 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment vote on the
amendment

01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%

two five all right 13- five on the
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
all right and then on the uh on the main
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended um is there
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
anyone who wishes to speak further on
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
the on the main bill up to pass as amend
 
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
representative gon although I U oppose
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment because of the stated
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
reasons regarding the definition of a
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
veteran including a uh member of a
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
foreign Allied
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
country um I will go ahead and support
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
the bill because overall I think it's an
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
important program I think it's a good
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
program if the finance committee would
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
find it to to delete that I would
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
support that uh if the Senate were to
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
take it out I would I'd support the bill
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
still uh I would prefer that that that
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
either be greatly qualified or
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
eliminated uh but I will go ahead and
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
support the bill uh because I think it's
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
a good bill overall otherwise right
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
other questions comments yes
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative stap
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm in the same stad there
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
um and you know we take a chance with it
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
and hope for the discretion of a judge
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
in any particular case uh otherwise if
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
somebody jumps through a loophole and
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
there's meat for another bill another
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
time but I'm going to go with it right
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
other other comments Mr chair yes I
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
support the bill the underlying bill I
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
think it's a great Bill thank you thank
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
you uh any yes representative Andrew
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'll support the bill but someplace in
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
the process I that one line I believe
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed improved somehow
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
because the way it is it's leaving
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
everything wide
 
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
open um well no so you know I think
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace suggested that
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
this is going to go to finance um
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's no re although although Finance
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
see as we all know Finance Deals Only
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
with money um they never see I've
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
learned I've at least learned that from
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
my term on F they may if they're if they
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
if they are persuaded that there should
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
be some change um um they can make that
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
and one of the other the only other
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
comment I would make on on this and I
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
think I think we're doing the right
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
thing by passing it and then you know
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
letting if Finance wants to Tinker with
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
it that's fine one of the things I hope
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
that would happen in finances we don't
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
have uh representative Moffett here who
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
is a you know was a longtime service
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
member and I think my suspicion is that
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
he might have some more some Fuller
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
answers to some of the concern leg very
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns that you've raised
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
as to why he he put that language in
 
01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
there the only thing that I changed uh
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
bear in mind the only thing that I
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
suggested as a change that's mine is
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
that thing about uh contractors being in
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
a theater of conflict all of the other
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
stuff was in the original bill as
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
drafted by representative uh ma so he
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know as the military experts so to
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
speak he might have better he might be
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
able to assu assuage some of the
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
concerns you've raised and that can be
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
done when it gets to finance is a floor
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment possible uh on that you know
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
down the road sure you could either have
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment in finance or I suppose a
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment sure sure um all right
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
so then I'm uh anybody else have any
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
comments on the U otpa motion all right
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
um all right uh the last bill um and
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
since we don't have a full compliment
 
01:12:49.629 --> 01:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
here I am uh I'm going to delay uh I
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
guess until our next executive session
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
the vote on um
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
1412 um but not on Tuesday but not on no
 
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
no no it will not be on T it will not be
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
not sure because I suspect we are we
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
will be deeply divided and I think we I
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
think we ought to have we ought to no we
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
ought to have all 20 people here for
 
01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.350 align:start position:0%
ought to have all 20 people here for
that

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh session start oh session starts at no
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can 10 o'cl yeah
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
o' right right um we will have exective
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
session I believe the chair expects to
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
have executive session in the morning of
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
the 15th that's correct yes I so I'm I
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
mean I haven't sent it out yet it's not
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the calendar but we will have an
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on the morning on of
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
