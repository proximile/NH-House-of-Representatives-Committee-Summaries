know okay this this is the work session
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully um Rick and Glenn will be
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
back here shortly so the idea is to
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
figure out what what we want to do or
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
get some consensus on bills for our exec
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
session next week so we'll start with um
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
Senate bill for 44 establishing New
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire work forth passway program um
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
so first I guess open it up for anybody
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.150 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
nobody well I guess I'll give
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
mine well I think I mean we have right
 
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
now I don't think this is needed right
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
now because unemployment is way down um
 
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
it' be nice though if this add it so
 
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 align:start position:0%
people can get a CDL license because
 
00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 align:start position:0%
that seems to be what's needed
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and Country but
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
anyway I
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
think with the unemployment being we're
 
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
3% now and jobs all over and we're doing
 
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
away with uh you know people looking for
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
jobs um I personally don't think it's
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
needed but
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
well I think Ralph this does this this
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
bill does provide uh an opportunity uh
 
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.790 align:start position:0%
bill does provide uh an opportunity uh
to

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
re-engage uh some of those
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the help wanted that we
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
do see I I think this provides an
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for individuals who are
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
currently unemployed or
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
underemployed uh to seek alternative
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
sources for their work career and I I
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't think there should be anything
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
that we should do here that would
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit the opportunity for people to
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
advance themselves and it seems to me
 
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
that uh this program and working with uh
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and security
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are there should be
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
options for people to advance themselves
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I I would not want to frankly stand
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
in the way of uh individuals uh learning
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
different things and uh advancing their
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
career Porter has her hand repres
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you Mr chair for for
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak um I think I have
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
to agree with representative Miler and
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
if if we remember prior to the pandemic
 
00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly we had critical
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
work Workforce shortage in critical
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
areas um businesses were crying out for
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
people who were specifically trained for
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
certain jobs um and and I can't imagine
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
that that has gone away uh and when
 
00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 align:start position:0%
things come back those needs will still
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
be there and a program like this would
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
offer a pathway for someone to get the
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
certification certification or the
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
education that they need to to join
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
those professions so I I I looked at it
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
as a as a helpful tool for people who
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
were underemployed or trying to make
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
their lives better by leaving a low
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
skill job and going to a higher skill
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
job representative
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
Cornell okay I just want to agree with
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
melan marjerie um one of the things that
 
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
said was underemployed New Hampshire
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
adults um to gain more skills and some
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
of the testimony was from the auto
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
dealers who were speaking on behalf of
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
500 businesses who asked that they
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
needed more skilled workers and I'm also
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
on the um CTI advisory Council where all
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
the business people that are on that
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
Council are saying they're having a hard
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
time finding people with the skills to
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
go into their their places of work and
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
they're have and they are willing to
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
help train them but they they need help
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
and they they want them to go into like
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
the community college and they'll work
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
along with them but it's it's not the
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
the unemployment signs that are out on
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
the streets I don't think is targeted
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
toward this bill
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's all representative
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
Ford yes uh the Career and Technical
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
education people are very supportive of
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
this it links in with their efforts to
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
get people trained in very specialized
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
fields that requires some of the
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
certifications were talked about in in
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
various committees that we've we've uh
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
discussed these issues in and I I would
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
be very supportive of this I I think it
 
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
ties in very much with their their
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
efforts to train the workforce and the
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
whole Workforce program idea and so I'm
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm very much in support of this bill
 
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.430 align:start position:0%
I'm very much in support of this bill
represent

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
valet yes thank you Mr chair uh does not
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
the community college system have the
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
authority to create this program now for
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
themselves why do they need legislation
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
to create an internal program they want
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
muted I'm just wondering what this does
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's not already being done by all of
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
these things is the difference just that
 
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.050 align:start position:0%
it's somehow it's being paid
 
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
it's somehow it's being paid
[Music]

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
for yeah I mean point is the auto
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
dealers already
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
funding the community college for that
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff I think a lot of it comes
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
down to reading it it's the tap into the
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
federal money that's being offered like
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the Community College um but I don't
 
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.150 align:start position:0%
for the Community College um but I don't
know

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
Mullen yeah thank you very much uh
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative boam there are two things
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
that caught my attention one is that
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
there is no cost to the individual for
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
the training that is being offered
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
through this program so I think you're
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
right I think harnessing some of the
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
monies that are available to us and
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
using it to benefit underemployed or
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
unemployed people is one thing and then
 
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
the second thing is at the end of the
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
bill it talks about um businesses uh and
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
training facilities working to come up
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
with incentive programs to attract
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
workers so I think that that's probably
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
a pretty important part of this as well
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
because as we all know we can have the
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
jobs but if we don't attract the people
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
to fill the positions then they sit
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
empty uh representative wood thank you
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would agree with
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
representative M that was one of the
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
points I want to indicate that that is a
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
recruitment effort with we currently
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
haven't had is the key piece the other
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
one is that some folks have alluded to
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
there isn't a financial note because
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
it's part of the
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
the federal Workforce opportunity
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
resources money but I do like the
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
collaboration and and putting together
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
Employment Security as well as economic
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
development and uh our community colle
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
system which hasn't been there before as
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
a Triad so I think those two pieces in
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
itself I just provide more opportunity
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
the more we can advertise and train
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
those that want to move up as
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell said I I concur
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
with them 100% thank you I got a
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
question for anybody out there shouldn't
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
at least this bill have a sunset
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
provision saying once the federal money
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
goes away this goes
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
away I would be in support of that um at
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the federal funding having a
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
sunset Clause otherwise it has to come
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
out of the budget
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
so had her hand raised at one point I
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
put back
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
down okay so I think we'll end the
 
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
discussion on 40 4 and when we have
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
exact session we can go over this again
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
so our next one is one of I call the
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative home I didn't I don't
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
know if Louise wanted to speak or not um
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
can you just give me a thumbs up or
 
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
thumbs down did you have something well
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
taking this isn't a hearing so we're not
 
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
open to the public for given comments
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
Lou Andrews oh
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
Louise I didn't I'm sorry didn't see and
 
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
Andrew yeah thank you Mr chair my only
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
question was and I think deor Hobson
 
00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
answered it is what are we going to do
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
when this Federal money comes to an end
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't believe we can go back to
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayers and have them
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
pick up the bill and so there really
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be a lot of thought put into
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know what are we going to do because
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
the government has a tendency of giving
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
us money and when they want to they yank
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
it back thank
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
you agree that's why I think we need a
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's at least need an amendment
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
for sunset provision Mr chair um if I
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
may I see that uh we do have Shannon
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
Reed who is is a representative from the
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
community college system in our attendee
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
list I'm wondering if she might be able
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
to give us some clarity around some of
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
the questions that we've had around uh
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
the availability of current uh options
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
for Community College Etc I mean could
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
we invite her in if she has some
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
comments on this particular
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:51.500 align:start position:0%
okay welcome to education
 
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.110 align:start position:0%
okay welcome to education
[Music]

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
Shannon hi Shan go ahead
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me yes all
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
right thank you um thanks for the
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity I I guess what I I would say
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
just a few quick things um first we
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be seeking an appropriation
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
even in the absence of federal funds for
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
this um for this effort we think that
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
there's enough sources of funds kind of
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
already available to us um to do what we
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
need to do and in fact there's really
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
not an extra cost to doing the types of
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
of efforts that are within House Bill 4
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 44 um the few things the
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
things that we like about it just
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
quickly it creates a for a more formal
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
mechanism it brings some shape and
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
structure to efforts which are which
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
exist in the state but are probably more
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
siloed than uh they ought to be for
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
optimal impact on New Hampshire
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
residents and job Seekers and businesses
 
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that our low unemployment
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
figures in New Hampshire probably mask a
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
low labor force participation and I
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
think that there are people out there
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
who could really use some focused
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
short-term training to find good um and
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know good jobs better jobs than
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
those that they have or or might have
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
recently lost um this program would help
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
us to work with partners and and
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
identify Pathways for folks to gain
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
skills and reenter um you know
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
potentially higher skill higher paying
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
jobs and it does in fact position the
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
state I think more uh strongly for for
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
competitive federal grants where where
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
the grantor can see that we have
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
a coordinated effort to bring to bear on
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
this issue of
 
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
Workforce a question foran
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
um in the community college system now
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
currently what percentage I mean a
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
number of people looking I mean in the
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
Past coming out trying to get a
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
certificate or a badge or whatever for
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
upping their education not now
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
exists I think it's hard for me to
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
answer that question with Precision
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
because people will come to our colleges
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
with multiple and sometimes you know one
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
person will have multiple goals but you
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
know I'd say well over half are are
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
really focus on that career credential
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
um in the first instance and then they
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
might have a goal kind of beyond that to
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
continue their education but you know
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
probably half to three quarters easily
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
are are here come to us for that next
 
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.750 align:start position:0%
are are here come to us for that next
step

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
you okay how can I
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
yes Miss Reed if I could ask you a
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
question um thank you for allowing me
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that um there's already
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
a program or it seems to be a program
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
that is the auto dealers reaching into
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
the CTV um schools and I was just
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if is that um not working or
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
do you need an alternative demographic
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
not really
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
sure um that that this would be doing
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
anything different than is already being
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
done it seems like we're working really
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
hard to find those workers wherever we
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
can already so how was sure thank you
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
for for that question you know I think
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
if every industry sector functioned as
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
the auto dealers did New Hampshire would
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
be uh even stronger economically that is
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
a that is an association of of um of
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that band together to
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
strengthen their Workforce Pipeline and
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
they do that in a number of ways I think
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
that that industry frankly can serve as
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
a model to to others I mean the auto
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
dealers Association work together to
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
help uh help Infuse our curriculum um at
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
the college level and the CTE level to
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
raise funds for scholarships to have um
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
events that promote the the industry
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
sector as a whole and and promote the
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
job Pathways they work with us to create
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
Co-op experience for students kind of
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
Soup To Nuts they they work with the
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
education uh sector to make sure that
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's a pipeline you know in fact I
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
think that that is that is a model I
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
know that the auto dealers supported
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
this do support this bill because I
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
think they just be the potential for
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
expanding the type of work that results
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
in a strong and ongoing pipeline for
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
high demand industry
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
sectors go ahead could I could I ask a
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
followup so it seems to me that maybe
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
you think this this type of a pathway
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
program could be replicated in other
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
Industries is that kind of the goal I I
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
think that's could certainly be within
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
the community college system in the last
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
few years we've developed apprenticeship
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
programs in healthcare manufacturing it
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're working on hospitality and
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
construction trades um you know I think
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of potential um and you
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire we're very we're
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
very fortunate we have a lot of people
 
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
and entities that have identified the
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
right set of challenges and and problems
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
and even Solutions but bringing bringing
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
those efforts together around a table I
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
think could really result in um in
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
benefits to the state thank
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very much okay
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
then with that I'll end a 44 and move on
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
to 147 which is one of the
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Omnibus Bill or I call ominous
 
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.590 align:start position:0%
Senate Omnibus Bill or I call ominous
bill

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
to adopting Omnibus legislation relative
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
to student a the central registry
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
Transportation students and special
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
education course part one
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
relative for filing an application for
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
federal student aid or the faster
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
application anybody got any comments on
 
00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:42.830 align:start position:0%
application anybody got any comments on
part

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
one represent H thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the motive behind having
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
every student fill out of FAA um however
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
it is rather intrusive for the families
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
that won't qualify for federal aid to be
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
required to fill out a form when they
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
know that there is no chance of this a
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
and that that would be taking away
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
resources from all of these departments
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
to review these applications that will
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
be thank you anybody else I don't agree
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
with that and right now I mean when my
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
granddaughter going the the uh there
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
there are organizations that go around
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
to the high schools in the junior year
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
at the state well I can't think of the
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
name of it but they inform students on
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
what to do and how to do it and also
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
most uh high school
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
counselors also already doing this so
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
personally I don't think it it's needed
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's like you said if everybody you know
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
everybody doesn't need to do it or will
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
do it anyway and I even when I do my
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
taxes big question comes up do you want
 
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
to do do a faf up so people are getting
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
that in all that questions anyway um
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
okay so any any other comments on
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
represent Luna oh thank you very much Mr
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
chair I think what you might be missing
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
on this though is that there is a waiver
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
um that can be um can be filed so that
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
if if the condition exists like what you
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
just laid out what you and
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lon laid out that that
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's no chance that they're going to
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
um receive financial aid or something
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
like that then they can file the waiver
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
with their with the local school
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
principal it um doesn't go through the
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
Education and I think um uh we do have a
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative um uh Mr applebe uh who
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
can uh who can testify again that it's
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
not collect the waiver is not being
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
collected by the uh by the department of
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
Ed and so it's a very very simple
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
process but um but for people that uh
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
that that for students that that are are
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
not considering going on to high higher
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
education um whether that's a a a
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
credential uh high value um certificate
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
like what we just talked about um in the
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
in Senate Bill 44 uh because they they U
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
think that they can't afford going ahead
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
and doing that this opens a lot of doors
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
it opens doors for for our Workforce it
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
opens doors for our constituents and and
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't have any um you know
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do doesn't um set up any
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
hurdles for um uh for anybody uh to
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
graduate um to graduate high school and
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
States like Louisiana uh who have rolled
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
this where they've rolled this out it's
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
been very successful so so um I hope um
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
the committee would uh would um support
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
this um initiative very strongly L uh
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair while I appreciate um
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
that that motive this would require
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
families with a higher income to file a
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
waiver and basically say we make too
 
00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
much money that can bring other
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the school and that
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
brings personal financial information
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
into the hands of the principal and
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's not appropriate we may have
 
00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
another way to increase backs of
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
participation but requiring everybody
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
either to make sure that they provided
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
their personal financial information or
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
say we're too rich for this is is an
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
privacy

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh not to sound of
 
00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh not to sound of
stous

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
stous
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
but what if I just don't want to fill
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
out a faster why should I have to seek a
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
to that that that's an egregious
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
invasion of my my choice to fill it out
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
or not fill it out it seems to
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
Ellison thank you Mr chairman uh I I
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
would certainly support what
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno has said uh and and
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
in addition it appears to me on the
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
waiver there's nothing that requires a a
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
family to State their income right
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
they're just making it up in in the b in
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
the bill uh I I guess my main point
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
would be that we have lots and lots of
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
students who
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
graduate uh who for a iety of reasons
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
don't think they can go on to higher
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
education they they don't know that that
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh Aid exists they don't know how to get
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
it and I see this as a bill which we
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
helping get more students into that
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
pipeline whether it's community college
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
or university because they will be aware
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
that there's financial aid available and
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
repres

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
repres
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um under the waiver
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
Clause uh Mr chair I I didn't see
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
anything that said it had to go with the
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
principal it just says it goes to the
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
school district that could be a guidance
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
contct could just be a file that they
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
check off and if I recall from the
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
testimony they said one of the the
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
beauties of this program is that they
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
have taken the 100 questions that
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
typically involved in the big fast and
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
get it down 18 simplified ones so it's
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
not a big uh process just seems to me it
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
opens the door for anyone who wants to
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
go and it forces the school system in
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
all guidance councils to help all
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
youngsters fill out this form that may
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
have had difficulty with it before so I
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
think I think it's a pretty good thing
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
actually and I don't see it as invasion
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
of privacy um there may be someone from
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
the school department on the list could
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
identify that for us answer the question
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
but I don't see anything on the waiver
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
at least in the law that talks about
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
what the requirement is for disclosing
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
Financial maybe a waiver just says I
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to participate for whatever
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
reason it could be a youngster not going
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
to you're going to the military for
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
instance okay so if someone from the doe
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
was there could answer that question
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
that'd be terrific about it regarding if
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
in fact the waiver has financial
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on it represent Hopson
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
ahead I said but go ahead oh thank you
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh this proposed law says shall
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
okay so if this becomes law then people
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
shall file a an application or shall
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
fire a waiver so my question is if
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
somebody breaks the law and does not
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
file either one of these what is the
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
sanction I don't know if somebody can
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
but I I don't know rep okay um I had a a
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
question for rep luno um is it okay if I
 
00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
ask another yeah this this is a work
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
session so we can be somewhat I just I
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ask you um re know you
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
said that another state was um working
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
this program and had implemented it and
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
it was successful I can't remember the
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
state that you mentioned but I was
 
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could tell me um what
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
is the goal of a successful program like
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
this what are they trying to
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
achieve do that make sense that question
 
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
no no no I think that's I think that's a
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
good question and um and I think what
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
they've seen in um in Louisiana is that
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh is that more students have have
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
completed the FAFSA and are able to uh
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
to um pursue opportunities in higher
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
education whether that's at an
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
Associates level or Bachelor or fouryear
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
level or even with a um with high value
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
certificates so so I think that's how um
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
how they
 
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
success thank you very much represent
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
Mila U thank you Mr chair uh I I see
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we have Steve applebe in the uh
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
attendees list he might be able to we
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
admit him he might be able to answer
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
some of these questions uh but uh the
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
one the point I wanted to make is that
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
it it would seem to me that the policy
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
of this committee should be to encourage
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
the advancement of an individual's
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
education and one of the things that we
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
did find when we did the SAT test uh
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
when we uh implemented that several
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
years years ago as a result of students
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
who would not ordinarily have taken the
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
SAT test they took the SAT test and
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
found that they were competitive with
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
other students and in fact encouraged
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
them by taking the test seen how well
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
they did to pursue further higher
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
education I view this part one of this
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
omnus bill in a similar kind of a light
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
that once somebody body would file these
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
forms they may in fact find that they
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
they they can get uh funding to advance
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
their education and that's why I think I
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
would I would support this but I would
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
encourage you Mr chair to admit Steve
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
applebe to see if in fact he might be
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
able to answer some of the questions
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
that we've been dealing with here thank
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you Mr chair and please
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance on asking this
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
question not as familiar with the
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
education issues as you folks are but
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
aren't there other things that we
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
require students to do before they
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
graduate Civic task I mean isn't there
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
some don't they have to take certain
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
tasks and don't they have to go through
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
certain things before they can graduate
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
and would this not just be another one
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
things file a FAFSA or give us a waiver
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
that you're not going to file a
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
f I think this is to me it's
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%

granddaughter
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:00.750 align:start position:0%
 
applebe

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
hey Mr applebe I'm going to promote
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
education hi there okay you're there
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
good morning Miss have you been
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
listening to this
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
conversation um I I will apologize the
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education meeting is also
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
going on right now so I've been
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
listening to both so that happy to help
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
with any questions as best I can okay
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
basically it's I think the thing
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
revolves around why should people not
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
planning on on wanting to do the faster
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um are not planning on going to college
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe going into the military have to
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
file a waiver and I think that's the big
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
contention we
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
have do you have any insight on
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
that um well I you know in my reading of
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
the bill right it appears that the State
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
Board would engage in R making to
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
develop a form for the districts and
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
then distribute that form to the
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
districts and then from that point
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
forward it appears to be the the
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
district's responsibility to enforce the
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
um the think says
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
shell F that waiver the bill so what
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
would happen if the student
 
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:48.519 align:start position:0%
refuse any any idea on that well I'm I'm
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
not an attorney and um uh but I in my
 
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
reading I I of the proposed language um
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
um lay um thank you Mr appelby and Mr
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
chair I have a question about how much
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
of a burden this is going to place on
 
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
the districts I know that later today
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
we're discussing s SP 135 because people
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
families aren't returning the free and
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
reduced meal forms and that's been a
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
significant effort in a significant cost
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
in my U um is this something where the
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
school district are going to have to
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
dedicate people and resources in order
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
to follow up on these encourage these
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
students and uh make this a new part of
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
the recordkeeping and a significant new
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
effort uh thank you for the question
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't want to speak
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the districts my
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation might be to check with
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
the Schoolboard Association or the um uh
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
nhsaa potentially and and for an opinion
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
districts thank
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
you repres woodcot do you have a
 
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.750 align:start position:0%
you repres woodcot do you have a
question

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
for I do thank you re chairman Mr thank
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
you very much for taking my question uh
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the waiver and as I was
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
listening to speak it it seemed to me
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
that the waiver has not been created um
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
with a document so this may be a mute
 
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
question one of the concerns are raised
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
by uh representative Leon was the
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure of potential Financial wealth
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
or not thereof for youngsters filling
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
out form the waiver form is it possible
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh development of the
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
waiver form that there was no
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
requirement to indicate Financial need
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
just say I he by wave so this is not uh
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
issue um so again I don't want to speak
 
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079 align:start position:0%
for the state board when they create
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
rules uh to support this form but I
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in the legislation
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
that requires this the form to contain
 
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
financial information either way thank
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%

chair
 
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
lakas you
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
go um I'm just trying to figure out what
 
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
we do about the students whose parents
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
generally don't comply with anything my
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
um a girl that we kind of unofficially
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
fostered for years we had all kinds of
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities fully paid for her her mom
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
just had to fill out a form and it never
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
happened and I'm wondering what do we do
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
about those kids because her mom
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't fill out a waiver either does
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
she not graduate because her mom's you
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
know she's already had she already had
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
enough rough things in her life had
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
having a a no father and a
 
00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:03.079 align:start position:0%
mostly um I don't know what word to use
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I just worry about she
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
is not she was not unique I know there
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
are other kids in the same kind of boat
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I just wonder what do we do about
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
those kids if we mandate this she didn't
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
she wasn't an adult until after she
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
graduated so right yeah that's that was
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
by thing I mean sh so what's the penalty
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah there nothing there
 
00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:33.870 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah there nothing there
representative

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair I really
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
question this part of the
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill because many of our schools and I
 
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
know our school district we spend
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of dollars in
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
high school every year for guidance
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
counselors now to my knowledge guidance
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
counselors a student is assigned to each
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
to one of them and they are to help the
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
students so uh my question is are we
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
just adding another layer of bureaucracy
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
that isn't needed thank
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chair um to
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative lec's concern about that
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
child that doesn't have the adult
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
support um I think Roman numeral 2 takes
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
care of that representative leus because
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
it makes us statement that says uh a
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
school district shall award a high
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
school diploma to a student who is
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
unable to meet the requirements of
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph one due to extenuating
 
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances so I I would think as
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
determined by the school so I I would
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
think that if a student you know doesn't
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
have the parental support or whatever
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
then they would be able to appeal to
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
said guidance counselor or whatever and
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
it would be considered to be an
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstance um I agree with
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
you I was concerned about the impact of
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
shell until I recognized that there was
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
an escape hatch there um and with
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
regards to representative Andrew's um
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
comment on school counselors um handily
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
I happen to be a school counselor so I
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
will uh comment a little bit on that um
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
the FFA is considered to be within the
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
domain currently of the parent so um
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
other than just directing a student to
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
where they could access the form the
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
school counselor wouldn't have much to
 
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.390 align:start position:0%
school counselor wouldn't have much to
do

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
with the followup on that because the
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
the school is not you know technically
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
involved in the FSA at this point
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
however um I don't think it would be
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
burdensome for a counselor to have it on
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
the checklist of things that have to be
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
done and uh to be able to review with a
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
the student whether or not it has
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
happened okay thank you re Le um thank
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um Representatives Ellison
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
and Miler both brought up some fantastic
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
points uh representative Ellison spoke
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
to how much more simplified this form is
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
and with 18 questions instead of a 100
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
that's already going to reduce the
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
burden and as representative Miler said
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
we already have more students who are
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
encouraged because as they're taking the
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
SAT as part of their Statewide
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
assessment they see how competitive they
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
will be at the college level or perhaps
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh see that they might um look to get
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
some secondary education and the trades
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
with that we're already priming them to
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
think about that higher education and
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
we've already reduced the burden well we
 
00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
haven't the feds have already reduced
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
the burden by going to a much more
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
simplified form instead of adding this
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
burden to these districts why don't we
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
see how this new simplified system works
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
before we try and add more layers and
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
more mandates that the town will have to
 
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.150 align:start position:0%
more mandates that the town will have to
pay

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
for okay thank you and say any more and
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
I think we should move on to uh part two
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll turn it over
 
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.430 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll turn it over
representative

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
cores I just wanted to say under B it
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
says the waiver could be signed by the
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
parent or guardian or if applicable the
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
student so if a student is 18 they could
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
sign that themselves couldn't they
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
saying that they don't want to do it yes
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay so if it was getting close to
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
graduation and their parents hadn't
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
signed it and I think most kids
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
graduating from high school are 18 they
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
can just sign the
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
waiver now but I know my granddaughter
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
was only 17 I was I was 17 99% of
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
students today are 18 years old when
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
they graduate from high school so that's
 
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.109 align:start position:0%
they graduate from high school so that's
all

00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
I guess my uh thought on part one here
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
is more fundamental in that um I don't
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
agree with uh um having this as a a
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
requirement uh for graduation that they
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
either have to fill out the uh
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
application or file a
 
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.829 align:start position:0%
application or file a
waiver

00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
component

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:42:27.069 --> 00:42:27.079 align:start position:0%
hson uh
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I just wanted to share
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
something that um I noticed as a school
 
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
board member um when uh kids are
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
graduating in their high school they
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
used to put up all these little tags
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
about where they're going to go to
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
college and it never occurred to me
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
until I actually saw it as a as the
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
parent of a senior that there are some
 
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
kids who opt not to go to college and uh
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know might might want to work in
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
their our family business and it it
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
really made me think about how it made
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
them feel as uh students maybe that you
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
know who who's celebrating them and I
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add that to the
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
conversation that BL on should wrap it
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you Mr chair um I I
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
actually was 17 when I graduated college
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the ages sorry do you
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
want to mute
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
sorry um if you look at the ages um with
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
the compulsory education if you are six
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
by September 30th then you go into first
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
grade that means that kids born in June
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
May June July August and September won't
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
be 18 if you have this form in by May to
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're on track for
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
graduation while that allows about 60%
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
of the students to sign their own waiver
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
that leaves 40% of the students out out
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
fold okay with that I think we spent a
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
lot of time on that so at this point
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative Vlad to take over part
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
two yeah thank you very much uh um I'm
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm a little bit late I was across
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh with represent cordelli uh talking
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
with the speaker um so evidently you've
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
gone through the first part of 147 uh I
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
have some issues with that as well um on
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
the first part um I I believe that that
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm in the same ballpark as
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli is that I do not
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
believe that we should this requirement
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
for graduation even though you may be
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
able to get a waiver but that still
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
requires you to get a waiver uh however
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
I do believe the FAA is very very
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
important and uh that we need to have
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
kids filling this thing out I think it's
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
a responsibility of the guidance
 
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
counselors to ensure that there there's
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
in-person communication with parents and
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
and and students and to provide
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
assistance in completing the FAFSA uh I
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to be tracking how
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
many uh fafsas are filed that is done by
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
the national clearing house uh however I
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
do think that it we need to have
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
something in place where we do say the
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
number and percentage of graduating high
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
school students and parents provide um
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
are provided inperson School assistance
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
in completing the free application for
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
federal uh application or student aid I
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
think that uh there there is a place for
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
that but I do not believe that this bill
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
in part one does it the way that I can
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
support thank
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
you so that's the my two cents to it uh
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
so let's move on to part
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
two part two is relative to the central
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
registry in the Department of Education
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
to maintain records of found reports of
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect are there any comments
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
section represent
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
Miler good morning good morning uh
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative lad the one question I
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
guess I have on this one is
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I did get a
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
contact of a concern
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
and this dealt with um bus drivers who
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
are not the regular bus yellow bus
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
drivers uh these are would be bus
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
drivers who I would consider more uh
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
coach drivers um ones that would uh take
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh kids uh students on a longer trip for
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
example down to Washington
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
DC uh with which you know you usually on
 
00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:56.839 align:start position:0%
those trips you you've got the teachers
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
You've Got U uh chaperon from parents
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
Etc and the the issue for me on this
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's a question um should those drivers
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
of those kinds of what I would call
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
coaches fall under the same
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
guidance as this particular registry is
 
00:47:17.839 --> 00:47:18.710 align:start position:0%
guidance as this particular registry is
looking

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.270 align:start position:0%
looking
for

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
um the individual that contacted me said
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
many of these uh companies
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
do this more as a it's not an an ongoing
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing it's not a daily thing
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
it's not even a monthly thing but it's a
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
special event kind of a thing and the
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
concern is is that if they have to go
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
under the same kind of
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
scrutiny as this particular law uh
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
proposal mentions they may stop doing
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
that and so it's I'm not sure anybody
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
else has had that kind of a contact or
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
that kind of a concern
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
but it was raised to me and I think it
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate concern particularly
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
when you think that these kinds of rides
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
that would be in these specialized
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
coaches do have other parents there uh
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
do have other adults there that are
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
supervising the students in this
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
particular uh Journey that they were
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
taking on this bus that so that was the
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
one question I think Rick that came to
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
my mind and I hadn't frankly even
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
thought of it until it was brought to my
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
attention well thank you Mel um we did
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
have some some discussion or at least it
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
was alluded to when this bill was
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
presented and I I tend to agree that we
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
have on trips that going using your
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
example to Washington DC on their annual
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
trip they may use do in the in the
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
junior high school level there's always
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
a supervising credential teacher on
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
board the bus or a uh representative of
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
the school on the bus that is an
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
employee and so and these are coaches
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm talking the coach bus you know the
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
old trail Trailways or the Greyhound or
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
the you know the conquered bus that goes
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
down or the the bus service that goes
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth down to Boston um so you
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
know I I I tend to agree do the bus
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
drivers then have to have you know the
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
same same uh uh record check and all as
 
00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:30.799 align:start position:0%
do the the supervisors that are teachers
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
on board the
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
bus I think you raise a question which
 
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.030 align:start position:0%
bus I think you raise a question which
is

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
legit yes represent wood
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
Woodside thank you uh Mr Woodcock thank
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Woodside here thank
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
you just a question on um as I read part
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
two distinct from part three part three
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
I see represented mil is concerned for
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh inter intermate uh coach drivers but
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
as as I read part two lines 24 and
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
25 uh school bus drivers and
 
00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:11.150 align:start position:0%
25 uh school bus drivers and
transportation

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
monitors I I and I'm probably wrong but
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
I interpret school bus drivers mean
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
those that drust the yellow bus that
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
drive the yellow bus and therefore the
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
the uh uh ones that representative Miler
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
and yourself represent are talking about
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
I think may be more applicable into
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
section three we're talking about the
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
the the piece just just a clarification
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
I'm probably wrong that's a good point
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay are there further hands up to
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
discuss this represent Porter you're
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
here I I am here Mr chair thank you for
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
welcoming me um I I guess although I've
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
read the bill through I'm a bit confused
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
part two is dealing with
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
um reports of abuse and neglect is that
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
referring only to
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
employees of a school district or are we
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
talking about parental abuse and neglect
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
mean would a school be rep having would
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education be having
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
parents I think I think this one is
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
licensure yes but part to just seemed to
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
be I was confused by the langage of the
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
me are there further questions or
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
comments on part
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
two my sense is that the intent excuse
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
me Rick but I think the intent here is
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh I mean we've had situations where an
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
individual who may have been dismissed
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh from a uh School District because of
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriate behavior and then gets
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
hired in another school district it
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this register this
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
registry is an attempt to try to
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
catalog uh those who have abused uh
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
children students Etc so that there is
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
some kind of a registry there that a
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
school district can check to see if an
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
individual has in fact had a similar
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
kind of experience in another school
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
district that was dismissed the the one
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
thing we don't want to have happen is to
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
have abusers just get shuttled to
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
another school district and perhaps have
 
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
the same kind of experience so I think
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
this registry is an attempt to try to
 
00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
provide some kind of a
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
centralization of those who have had a
 
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:20.799 align:start position:0%
history of this kind of behavior so that
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
they will not be able to be employed in
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
other in other school
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
districts that's my understanding of the
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
intent of this
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
language and and that that would be my
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
intent or understanding too of what the
 
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
intent would be I can recall when I was
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
in a school administrator out in
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
Alaska there was an individual that had
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
abused uh students that moved from one
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
Community into
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
Anchorage and was hired in Anchorage and
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
then did the same abuse and Anchorage
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
that should should have been stopped
 
00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
earlier either with loss of credentials
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
loss certification but it wasn't uh I
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
believe this part of this part two of
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
147 does set up a h a registry which I I
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
believe that type of incident could be
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
caught and and uh hopefully we'd stop
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh a Perpetual abuser from
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
moving from one Turf to another Turf um
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
so so I I you know the I don't really
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
have an issue with the part two I didn't
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
do any corrections within it I thought
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
it read pretty well I thought it was
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
something we needed um the issue of the
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
bus driver I think that that you know
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct it says bus
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
drivers and transportation monitors I'm
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation monitors a little bit
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
more slippery for me but I think part
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.309 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:58.930 --> 00:54:58.940 align:start position:0%
uh good morning
 
00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.910 align:start position:0%
uh good morning
[Music]

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
who's get my computer working Mr chair
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's representative Mullen if I might
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
make a comment and ask a question yes go
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Mullen okay so my
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
comment is that uh stripping this down
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
to the simplest language uh embedded in
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
the verbiage what I see is that we would
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
that what this bill would do is create a
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
registry that would prevent somebody who
 
00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
was founded of child abuse from being
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
credentialed as a teacher in New
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean period re that that's
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's how I read the bill which you
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
know it begs the question who would want
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
somebody who was founded of child abuse
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
to be a credential teacher in New
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyhow um but my question to
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
you is this um if Diana Fenton is
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions on this
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
bill would it be Poss possible for us to
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
bring her forward into the
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
conversation do we have her she's she's
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
in here I can her can you get me as a
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
person that I can't look at that oh okay
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
yeah um okay I've just promoted Diana
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
education okay um Miss Fenton is in the
 
00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:26.309 align:start position:0%
education okay um Miss Fenton is in the
meeting

00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
someone have a question uh represent
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
Mullen did you have a question I did I
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to know uh from attorney Fenton
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not I was being overly
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
simplistic and missing anything by just
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying that I think that the uh intent
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
and the language of the bill establishes
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
a registry that would keep track of
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
people that were actually found guilty
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
of abuse and prevent them from being
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
credentialed as
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
teachers or
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
that requires a license good morning
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee members um thank you for
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
having me representative Mullen in my
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
experience working with you uh you are
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
never overly simplistic um and you never
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
miss anything so um what what part two
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 147 does is in its
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
simplest form it will grant the
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Education before the
 
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
Department issues a credential to a
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
firsttime teaching applicant it will
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
grant the department
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
access to the already established DCF
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
central registry to address rep mullen's
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
point if someone has already been
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
founded for abuse and neglect uh
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
allegations we would not want to offer
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
an Avenue of access to Children through
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education this is
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
something that employment school
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
districts they do not have access to
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
this but the department would have
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
access to it when we credential people
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
to teach to address representative
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
Myer's concern of having individuals go
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
from one District to another um if
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
they've been inappropriate with a child
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
at one District we don't want them going
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
to another District that is a function
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
the department already does through its
 
00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
um credentialing system and through the
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
code of conduct which this body passed
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
back in uh
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
2017 through House Bill 210 um under the
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
code of
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
conduct has to report a violation of the
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
code of conduct to credentialing at the
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
department of Ed and that is how the
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
department can take action on the
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
license which does exactly what
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative Miler stated which is
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
preventing an educator from going from
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
District to District Senate Bill 147 is
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
really just strengthening the
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
Department's credential when we issue a
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
credential to an individual it really
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
says to the field this person has been
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
cleared through the dcyf central
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
registry they don't have a finding of
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and uh through a
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
different legislative um Bill we're
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
going to also do a criminal history
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
record check and so that tells the field
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
this person this individual is
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
employable and based on these checks
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
safe around
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
children thank you thank you I'm happy
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
to take any other additional questions
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your interest in this
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.109 align:start position:0%
thank you for your interest in this
bill

00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chair uh I keep
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the section I read it again
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
and again in most of the section is
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
simply listing jobs or or occupations or
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
or fields of people that need to be uh
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
subject to bankr checks to include
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
social workers and media Specialists and
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
as we said bus drivers uh why are
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
coaches or assistant coaches not in this
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
mix if everybody else is I don't know if
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
anybody can answer that
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm happy to answer that question
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative Moffet and and thank you
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
for the question and the
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity um coaches are not always
 
01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:12.069 align:start position:0%
opportunity um coaches are not always
certified

01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
Educators so if you think about it as a
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
ven diagram a certified educator can be
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
a coach but a coach doesn't have to be a
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
certified educator I am not a certified
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
educator but I can go and uh work with
 
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
my local School District to be a coach
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
for my son's you know soccer team or
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
what have you coaches are um
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
regulated via employment they are not
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
department that helps thank you thank
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
you but that that begs the the question
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
then um I've got the code of ethics
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
right in front of me here and um I can
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
remember when we put this together but
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's for those it's for certified folks
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
um many of our coaches are non-certified
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
but they're also there during school
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
hours at times and certainly from 3
 
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
o'clock to six o'clock or on weekends
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
with kids um so when we're hiring an
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
individual uh that's not certified how
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
does the school then ensure that that
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
individual's not had a prior history of
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.870 align:start position:0%
individual's not had a prior history of
abuse

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
so RSA 189 colon
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
13-a does the criminal history record
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
check for employment so if I work as a
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
coach at a school district I would be
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
subject to that statute and I would have
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
my fingerprints checked and my criminal
 
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
history record checked um this is where
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
we get into the difference between
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
employment and
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
lure and that's what Senate Bill 147
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
does 147 gives the Department of
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
Education access to the central registry
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
to um check that Clearing House your
 
01:02:04.029 --> 01:02:04.039 align:start position:0%
question representative lad is can we
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
grant that access potentially to
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
employment to districts to check um I
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
think the answer is yes we could do that
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
currently they don't have that access
 
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
but we can't do that in this you we can
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
work on doing that in the future and I
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
would look forward to working with you
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
on that I think this Senate Bill 147 is
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
an important step forward because right
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
now uh districts and the Department of
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
Education we do not have access to the
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
dcyf central registry and uh we are
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing the importance of having
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
access to
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much uh Miss Fenton
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
and uh represent mfet that's something
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
you might want to note that you brought
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
up the question the co-curricular
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
activity and non-certified coaches uh we
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
may want to look into that uh a little
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
bit deeper in terms of uh future
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'd be happy to work
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
with anyone on those ideas um we are
 
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:06.039 align:start position:0%
always looking at new ways to strengthen
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
child safety so I'm happy to serve as a
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
resource on that thank you Diane uh
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock your hands up yes sir
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
thank you represent lad jne Fenton just
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
a question clarification this uh DCF
 
01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039 align:start position:0%
central registry that that we taking uh
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
the information from now does that
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
candidates or is this strictly for a New
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire candidates for lure or those
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
pieces so it would only be if you
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
applying to the New Hampshire Department
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
of Ed to get a New Hampshire teaching
 
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
credential we would then run your name
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire DCF registry
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't matter if you're from
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont or New Hampshire
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
if you're applying for a New Hampshire
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
license we would work with New Hampshire
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
DCF however I think I know where you're
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
going with your question representative
 
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
Woodcock so I will take an opportunity
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
to do a little bit of a plug for work
 
01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing At Doe we are currently in
 
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
the process of creating anou with the
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts to grant us
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
access to the
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it's DCF it's not DCF but
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
it's the same fundamental thing um grant
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
us access to their records to run a name
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
through their database as well and we're
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
we are hoping in the future to expand
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
that to all our New England sister
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
States we're we're not quite there yet
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
but we are working with Massachusetts on
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you attorney Fenton thank you
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
representative L let asked a question uh
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh for Miss Fenton um I
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
can recall when I was uh an
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
administrator in Alaska we hired
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
teachers from all over this country
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
country Idaho from Maine a lot from
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
Maine some from New Hampshire mostly
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
along the Northern Tier and there was a
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
check is there such a thing as a
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
national register where if you're
 
01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
applying for certification I.E like in
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you come from Idaho is
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
there any way you have the uh ability to
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
check H for the background and and see
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
what has gone on in in their previous
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
life there is the federal background
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
check the FBI check that is what is
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
accounted for um in 18913a that's the
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
employment piece and as I mentioned
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
previously the Department of Education
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
will have the ability and the authority
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
to do a criminal background check
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
federal and state um when someone
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
applies to be a firsttime teaching
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
applicant I think the other part of your
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
question representative lad
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
is is there kind of a a national
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education database and and
 
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
there is it's called NASDAQ it sounds
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
like the stock market version but it's
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
um it's not quite it is a private
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
organization and can um pay membership
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
to track educators and uh enter
 
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
Educators into this database uh New
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the New Hampshire
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is a member of
 
01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.190 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is a member of
that

01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
organization so we do receive
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
information from other states and we
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
enter um Educators who have had their
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
license Ed or suspended uh for
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
violations of the code of conduct we
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
enter them into that system as well to
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
prevent them from going to other
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
states so as a followup does uh your
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
department your uh certification folks
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
over there uh check with the NASDAQ not
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
the stocks but with that
 
01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:47.029 align:start position:0%
the stocks but with that
organization

01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
um just as you were asking that question
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
I want to just double check with
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
credentialing before I answer that I
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
believe that that we do but um I know
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
that that is an initiative we're
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
undertaking so let me put a pin in that
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
for a moment and I will check and get
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
back to you on that I do know we
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%

answer the last question posed to
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton regarding the nasc list
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
um that list is uh we connect to their
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
database electronically from our lure
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
database and um each night overnight a
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
job is run that compares any new
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
applicants in our que to the National
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
list and those are flagged for the
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau of credentialing for the next
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
morning and that happens daily so um if
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
if in fact an educator action is taken
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
against their license in another state
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
we are notified of that you know within
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
a day and um if that individual were to
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
apply here then we would refer the
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
matter to our investigator before
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
credentialing that
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.870 align:start position:0%
credentialing that
individual

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%
are there questions for Mr
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
applebe I have one um might as well get
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
them all out uh if you have an
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
individual that's coming in from South
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
Carolina and went through and had the
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
check when they initially got their
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
certification in South
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
Carolina however there have been any
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
issues that that person had been
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
involved when subsequently to receiving
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
South Carolina certification and the
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
individual then decided well I'm coming
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
up to New Hampshire to be a teacher here
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
um when you're checking with this the
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
the NASDAQ I is there is that updated as
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
situations occur during the tenure of a
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
teacher yes thank you for the question
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
chair um the a as a state if a state
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
takes action against a license or other
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
credential of an educator in any of the
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
50 states States as well as several
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
territories um that in that one of the
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
steps that all the states follow is they
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
then report to nasc that that uh action
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
that was taken a revocation a suspension
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
a reprimand and that is loaded into the
 
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
database as it's occurring and then um
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
at that point you know we're made aware
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
if that person then applies here so if a
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
person receives a reprimand but doesn't
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
have certification strip
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
um you will see that when you do the
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
check yes and again we would then turn
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
over that to our investigator who would
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
check into the
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
situation thank you are there other
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
applebe not seeing any thank you very
 
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
much Steve thank
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions or discussion on
 
01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
you any other questions or discussion on
part

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
two Let's uh move on on to part three of
 
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.709 align:start position:0%
two Let's uh move on on to part three of
of

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
147 this is relative to transportation
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
carrier champ yes representative bone
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh this is probably what
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative mil was talking about
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
before and I I have to agree with him
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
um thing is on any of these buses
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
whether it be even you know on long
 
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
trips or even Sports there's always
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
adults teachers coaches and other
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
chaperons on the bus and this may
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
also if somebody's a convicted pedophile
 
01:11:36.629 --> 01:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
notify their employer of that and they
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
won't be allowed to carry so I don't I
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
think this goes overboard and I don't
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
think it's needed because there are
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
always some adults chaperon and what or
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
coaches on buses that uh coaches on on
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
coaches will say that are being used by
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the school districts to go places um
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
other than the big yellow the big
 
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
yellows we know they're they're covered
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this goes a little bit
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
too far um like um represented Miler had
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
said before we might not be able to get
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
a coach to take people
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere if they have to go through all
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
this extra expense so I don't think part
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah represent Woodcock you have your
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
hand up yes sir thank you chairman I
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
this is just an open question I have two
 
01:12:39.149 --> 01:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
questions uh I'm looking at uh obviously
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
pot part three but I'm looking at the
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
section um that deals uh I'm on page
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
four and I'm looking at the lines two
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
and three I had highlighted from the
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
before um where it said job training
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
programs I'm not sure there would be a
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
monitor or a teacher uh in that bus with
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
them to a job training program and also
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
under special education transition
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
Services um maybe representative Cornell
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
lolan can clarify that for me I'm
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
thinking transition services are from as
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
they exit out of the special ed program
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
to uh the 2122 so that may if I'm
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
correct I'm not sure that may not be uh
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
one that has a staff person as well
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
those are my two questions represent Ed
 
01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
those are my two questions represent Ed
thank

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
you are there any uh responses to
 
01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
you are there any uh responses to
represent

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
Woodcock other than the fact that uh
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean a transition service for a
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
specialed student typically applies
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
to uh a Ser an internship a supervised
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship something that's aimed at
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
the end of their educational experience
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
to transition them into the world of
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
work right so um that would I I I would
 
01:13:59.709 --> 01:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
I suppose it would depend upon the
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
nature of the disability but ostensibly
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
yes you could I would think have a
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
18yearold on in a van going to a job
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
site without an
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
adult I don't think I ever heard of them
 
01:14:14.669 --> 01:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
sending them off without an adult though
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
I because I I know in Manchester the
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
high schools have staff that that's
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
their job to accompany them to their
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
their job site so I I I would hope that
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't send them by themselves
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
does does that if I may Mr chairman does
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
that also include representative Cornell
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
Mullen does that include the 18 to 22
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
year old transition as
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
well before we yeah I I would think it
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
would the you know the IEP is in effect
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
until the 21st birthday so um I would I
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
would think it could be some individuals
 
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
between 18 and 21 okay so the other part
 
01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:53.790 align:start position:0%
between 18 and 21 okay so the other part
of

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
the job the job training program is not
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily monitored in terms of uh if
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
drivers I don't yeah I don't think I
 
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's an easy way to
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
answer that question because you know
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's an individualized ed plans so every
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
student's going to be different right
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
but the job the job if I may represent
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
lad the job training program is
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
separated from the special ed by by
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
commas so it's a separate entity it'd be
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
internships externships for the general
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
School population I'm not sure they
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
would have a staff person with them they
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
would just be providing Transportation
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
so there does cause some reservation
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
there in my mind thank you
 
01:15:33.159 --> 01:15:34.430 align:start position:0%
there in my mind thank you
representative

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
Leed uh yeah Erica uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
um I I feel a little lost here the part
 
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
three talks about um contract carriers
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
to transport 16 or more passengers and I
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
I don't quite understand how we'd be
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
transporting one or two student special
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
specialed education students to a job
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
training on a vehicle designed for 16 or
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.590 align:start position:0%
 
chaon

01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
chaon
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you thank you m thank you Mr
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
chair I think the other qualifier here
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's important where it says that
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
required to travel at least 75
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
miles that to me is is a fairly high
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
threshold for traveling and I I don't
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
know perhaps member of the committee
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
could answer the question are there
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
particularly dealing with the special ed
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
transition I mean 75 miles is a pretty
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
good distance uh and it's it's not like
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
going you know from
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
cirage to conquered for example I mean
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's significant and I think
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
that's a that's another qualifier that I
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
think U uh provides uh some detail in
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you and just to follow up to
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
that you know I can remember the
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
discussion with the director from Keen
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
that is it 75 miles one way or is it 75
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
miles combined to 150 miles we didn't
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
have any uh response on that so the
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
mileage figure may be something we want
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
to fur the look
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
at rep
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
Celli my question was answer thank you
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
clarification I I have in my and I may
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
be wrong Rick but I have my not I have
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
my notes that I asked that question at
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
the hearing and the answer was one way
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
75 miles one way so that would support
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Mila's it's a big trip
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's not the in town so yeah I can
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
remember that uh represent Woodcock
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
that's why I was I'm suggesting that we
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
have it say 150 miles round trip
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank another way of saying it yep
 
01:18:03.719 --> 01:18:07.709 align:start position:0%
okay thank another way of saying it yep
absolutely

01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
likeus can't hear you yeah I know I had
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
to unmute
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
um my qu I going back to what uh R Miler
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
said in the beginning that third part of
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
this says
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
as well as school bus driver cert
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
certification requirements and so once
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
again it sounds like this applies
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
to you know a a coach trip down to New
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
York City or whatever um or Washington
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
DC so and certainly those guys don't
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
need to have school bus driver
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
certification so how are we going to
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it does speak to school bus drivers
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
build would we just be able to eliminate
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
um all the
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
other um situations and just have it
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
be I mean eliminate that field trip one
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
and so that's the other
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
sense yeah I I think field trips are
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
definitely uh something we want to
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
protect we don't want these companies to
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
get to stop doing the field trips so if
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
we took field trips out and left all the
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
other things in perhaps that would just
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
cover the problem do we want to say
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
field trips using a professional coach
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
server you know somehow make that
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
different than a school bus field trip
 
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.790 align:start position:0%
different than a school bus field trip
or

01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
whatever this clarification or question
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
fiur might include trips from here to
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
Boston or Museum of Science so you hate
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
to have that out of
 
01:20:17.159 --> 01:20:20.510 align:start position:0%
to have that out of
there

01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
can we put in
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
instead um something that they don't
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
have to have the school bus driver
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
certificate as long as there
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
are I don't know somehow qualified other
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
adults like teachers or whatever
 
01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:45.570 align:start position:0%
teachers or
 
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:51.270 align:start position:0%
teachers or
[Music]

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
parents I mean
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
somehow we wanted to allow those Co
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
those professional Coach Services to be
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
generic anybody have any answers for
 
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.030 align:start position:0%
generic anybody have any answers for
that

01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
one I'm just represent line I'm just
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
concerned because it says shall include
 
01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
we're not limited to so this is just an
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
expansive list so no matter what we put
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
in to take out I mean it's just a wide
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
open list so I I think we're probably
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
not gonna make much Headway just taking
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
out one or playing with it because it
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
says not limited to so they a school
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
district could you know do their own
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
other additional
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
pieces well it's the school bus driver
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
certificate that I'm concerned about for
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
driver well I would think that if we're
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
going to use a commercial bus such as
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
you speak
 
01:22:09.679 --> 01:22:11.350 align:start position:0%
you speak
of

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
that there would be if you're talking
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
special education students there
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
certainly is going to have to be
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
somebody a school supervisor certified
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
person on the bus with them um if you're
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
talking about regular students as well
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh so where would we be using a
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
commercial bus if we didn't have a a
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
certified person on the bus I can see
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
the exception maybe a coach that even
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
the kids school that my kids go to they
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
use a commercial bus to take the kids to
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
sporting events seeing that they cannot
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
they have to travel a long way they're
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
in a division where there's no schools
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
close to them so the maybe the nearest
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
one is going to be over in Burlington or
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
down at Brattleboro from St Johnsbury
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
but they they need those buses for the
 
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
room for the athletic gear they need it
 
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
for the uh bathroom facility on the bus
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a coach there who may not
 
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:11.470 align:start position:0%
and there's a coach there who may not
have

01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
certification but he this coach is a
 
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.910 align:start position:0%
certification but he this coach is a
School

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
employee so so so really we've been
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
talking about three categories there
 
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
either certified Personnel a parent or a
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
School employee which would cover Rick
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
what you just said as far as a coach who
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
may not be a certified Personnel but as
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
an employee and a representative of the
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
district yeah I don't know about the
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
parent uh but the the uh certainly the
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
coach is an employee if the parent's not
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
being paid yeah what kind of training if
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
they had they may have had it may not
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
have or background search
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
represent Bo yeah I was on a long field
 
01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
trip and uh when I was in school and the
 
01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
parents Al we had to be fingerprinted
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
and a background check for the field
 
01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:09.639 align:start position:0%
trips that went over a day so for
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
example to Washington DC and whatnot if
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
there was a parent I did one going to
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
Europe I had to be fingerprinted and
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
background check so all the parents had
 
01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
to also so for those long trips you know
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
for day trips not but for trips
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
be don't Volunteers in schools have to
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
be think be background checked
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
anyway if you're volunteering at your
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
requirements do we have any uh
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%

talking about the part three of 147
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 147 which addresses uh the
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
use of contract carriers which are those
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
Greyhound type buses that have the
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom Etc and when we have kids that
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
are going on a trip that's using one of
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
those carriers do schools have any
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
requirements or is there any statutory
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that I don't know of where
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
you have to have a certified person or
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
an employee of a school on the bus
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
driver thank you for that question um it
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
would be my experience and I think the
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
experience that there are
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
typically uh teachers on those buses and
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
all volunteers to school uh trips need
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
to be uh need to have passed uh criminal
 
01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.550 align:start position:0%
to be uh need to have passed uh criminal
background

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
checks and and so your coach who's not a
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
teacher and doesn't have certification
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
but is an
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
employee that there's background check
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's been down in that employee as
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
well correct that would typically be my
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
experience I can't say it's 100% for all
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
trips but in any of those Washington DC
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
trips that I've been aware of and
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
involved in over the 40 plus years in
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
this business there's always a certified
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
teacher on or more than one actually on
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
buses okay um thank you very much Jerry
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for Jerry
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
F re Mullen your hand I I don't actually
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
know whether or not this question would
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
be for uh Mr FW or not um but it has to
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
do with uh the fact that the bus drivers
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
are supposed to comply with
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
26329 RSA
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
26329 also in Roman numeral 3 after the
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
criminal back ground check it says as
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
well as school bus driver certificate
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
requirements so I I I'm reading that as
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
you've got to take the
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
test that a bus driver would take to get
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
a bus driver's
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
certificate is anybody else reading it
 
01:27:42.199 --> 01:27:45.350 align:start position:0%
certificate is anybody else reading it
that

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
is right I mean it says that you have to
 
01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
do everything that a somebody who was
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
driving a school bus would have to do
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that would mean taking the bus
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
driver's exam right because it says all
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
the requirements within that and the
 
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
school bus driver certificate right and
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
so that's how can we how can we ask that
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
of uh you know conquer Co con Coach
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
Lines right
 
01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.270 align:start position:0%
Lines right
right

01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
okay are there further Is there further
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill or further
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
question can I just have a followup Mr
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh Mr lad yes goad lad I just want to um
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
again in that section three um with
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
regards to the criminal background
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
checks for volunteers at school there
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
are different designated uh types of
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
volunteers at schools and uh some of
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
those designated types would requ ire
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting some would require
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting and a background check it
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
depends upon the responsibility of the
 
01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
volunteer and whether or not they're
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
going to be alone with children um I
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
know that the chances that a conquered
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
coach bus driver is going to be alone on
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
a bus for 75 miles with a student is nil
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
but um I I do think we you know before
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
we make any assumptions about that
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
background check we ought to seek
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.639 --> 01:29:28.270 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay that we can yes L yeah can I sort
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
of add on to Sue's question on this and
 
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
and um and just a a couple questions
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
about the criminal uh background check
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh is does that also include
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
multi-state um and I know that's this is
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of of you know part
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
three here and does it also include
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
include the um what we just talked about
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
in part two the abuse and neglect um in
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
registry is there anybody from the
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
commercial uh DM or DMB we actually yeah
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth so hopefully she's available
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm G to you panel we have uh Elizabeth

lei uh listening she's from the dmbb as
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
a director uh maybe she can help uh with
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
questions good morning can you hear me
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
okay yes we can you good morning Mr
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Elizabeth B I am
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
the director of The Division of Motor
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
Vehicles um and thank you for allowing
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
me to speak I do want to let you know
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we were taking a neutral position
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
on this part of the bill but we were
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
working really closely with Senator Khan
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
on providing him the Lang language to
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
really lead to the policy decisions that
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
he wanted to achieve and I know that he
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
was working very closely with I believe
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
this Keen school district and kind of
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
leading him in in drafting this bill um
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
his goal was to really ensure that the
 
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
drivers that would be utilized for the
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
motor coaches really mirrored the
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that the school bus drivers
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
have to uh complete as well so I think
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
that's why you're seeing the language
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
that you are seeing because he wanted to
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are the drivers meet
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
the same requirements as those that are
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
drivers are there uh any questions or
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion with the
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
director that that does clarify some of
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
the history here so Elizabeth you're
 
01:31:44.669 --> 01:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
you're saying then that the driver of
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
this uh conquered coach is going to have
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
to have that also have that same school
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
bus driver certificate as required 263
 
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.590 align:start position:0%
bus driver certificate as required 263
col

01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
col
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
29 that is correct yes the bill intended
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure that this the coach drivers
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
would have to meet the certification
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and would have to have a
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
school bus certificate in order to be
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
activities do okay now another question
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
for you Elizabeth then is this going to
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
be really restricting
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
transportation um thank you for the
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
question I really am not sure if I'm in
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
a position to be able to answer that
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure whether the motor
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
coach companies would be willing or
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
would be in a position to uh put their
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
drivers through that in order to
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
contract with school districts um to uh
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
drive for the school related activities
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
or trips so I am not sure whether
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
they're standing ready and are prepared
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
to meet meet their requirements I think
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
it would be better served to ask um a
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative from conquered coach or
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much uh
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
represent go ahead U thank you Mr
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you director bki
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
this this question may be a bit broad
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
but given all of the economic challenges
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
and the difficulties with people getting
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
to work are you seeing anything through
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
the DMV about um fewer people looking
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
for these license is and pursuing these
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
training requirements and might that be
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
hardship um I can tell you that the
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
school bus industry specifically the
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
association always struggles to find
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
school bus drivers uh in general we've
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
been seeing over the past few years
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing a decline in CDL
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
Drivers and and the IND the CDL industry
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
is having a hard time finding qualified
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
drivers so I think the the industry um
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
and Commercial Motor Vehicle drivers are
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
definitely in hide and demand uh and
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
they're I know the school bus
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
Association is always looking and trying
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
to get to incentivize employees to come
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
on board as well I hope that answers
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
your question represent LE you follow
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
sorry if I can follow up um I guess one
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
question is if that's a matter of
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
disqualifying conditions or of training
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
and if there's um such a demand for it
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
it it might might it be possible that
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
the Coach Lines won't will be afraid of
 
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
additional competition if they pay for
 
01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
their their drivers to be scho by
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
certified thank you for the question but
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
again I'm not in a position to be able
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
to answer that question thank
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions of Miss
 
01:34:32.239 --> 01:34:34.709 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions of Miss
belucky

01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
Woodcock lad thank you lad thank you for
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question is there any uh
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
reciprocity in terms of the school bus
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
driver uh testing and the coach Lodge
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle testing I mean are they are they
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
both the same uh DMV
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
test no there are different uh
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
endorsements that you have to have on
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
your license so there would be a
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
separate passenger endorsement for coach
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
and there would be a separate School Bus
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
certificate in order to drive a school
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
bus thank you very much thank you
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
chairman Le
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
sure represent Mullen thank you Mr chair
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my uh my
 
01:35:21.119 --> 01:35:22.070 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my uh my
question

01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
mine is uh just a practical one in terms
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
of operating a school bus and operating
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
a coach bus would it require the same
 
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
skill set I know that there are two
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
separate paper tests but as far as
 
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
actually driving the buses if you can
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
drive a coach can you can you drive a
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
school bus and vice
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
versa um I thank you for the question I
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
can look to see if I can get you more
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
specific information I can tell you from
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
a vehicle perspect perspective the
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles are different uh there are
 
01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
different training requirements for
 
01:35:59.070 --> 01:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
school buses that um that really um
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
center around of safety of the occupants
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
on those so there are requirements to
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
conduct evacuation drills and things
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
like that there are specific training
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
requirements of the school bus driver as
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
well and there are annual training
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
requirements so um again the I think the
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
school bus certificate requirements are
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
a bit more restrictive to ensure that
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
the safety of the of the kids on the bus
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
is really um is is really front and
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
center thank you very
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
leus yes um to go along with these even
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
if the local companies coach companies
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
decided to have a certain number of
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
their drivers get this test I know if
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're driving very long distance they
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
may have to trade off drivers I remember
 
01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
as a band member um going
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
to to Canada to play for a uh um the
 
01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.109 align:start position:0%
to to Canada to play for a uh um the
Toronto

01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
Toronto
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
Argonauts we had to have a new driver
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
now you know whether you whether it's
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
there or crossing state or kids going
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
down to Florida to play in a
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
um parade or
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the question you know how are
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
we going to if we pass this
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
how are we going to have any chance of
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
having whoever that driver that has to
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
pick up and drive the next section
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
because they're only a lot to drive so
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
many hours at
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
once how is I mean I can't see that that
 
01:37:35.239 --> 01:37:37.430 align:start position:0%
once how is I mean I can't see that that
would

01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
work thank you I am um again I think the
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
bus companies would be in a better
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
position to answer that because if they
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
drive those distances I assume that they
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
have procedures in place to be able to
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
accommodate those because again those
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
those are as you as you stated those are
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
not really requirements specific to
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
school bus drivers but there are more
 
01:37:59.470 --> 01:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
requirements um related to commercial
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle drivers where they have
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
limitations on how many hours they can
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
be behind the wheel um so I'm not sure
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
what the current process is in place or
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
procedures um are that are in place for
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
those Bri drivers and companies that
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
trips Missy I I you have a followup uh
 
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
represent likeus well I was just just
 
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
wondering how we could possibly since we
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
have our requirements for school bus
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
drivers how we could possibly place that
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
state relief
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
driver again um I am not sure if I can
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
if I can answer that specifically I I
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
would really reach reach out to a motor
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
coach company to see how they deal with
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
situations like that right now I'm not
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
sure whether they have two drivers kind
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
of starting out in the state of New
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and one is driving and one's
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
kind of resting until it's time to take
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
over I'm not sure but those those hours
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
our restrictions are currently in place
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
for really any Interstate drivers or any
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
CDL um drivers so I would assume that if
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
motor coach companies have long trips
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
like that they must have procedures in
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that those hours
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
um um the limitations of those hours are
 
01:39:24.159 --> 01:39:25.629 align:start position:0%
um um the limitations of those hours are
adhered

01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
adhered
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
to thank you thank you Miss buy have do
 
01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
you know of or have you heard of a
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
contract carrier using a vehicle that
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
does not have a valid state inspection
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
sticker do I know of that um does that
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
occur um I am not sure
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
um how however um I know that um I I
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
have a member of State Police that's
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
listening as well so he might be able to
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
speak to um his experience with that um
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
so I am not sure if I I I specifically
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
don't know of any instances where those
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
vehicles have not been inspected well I
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
asked that question uh due to the the
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
bill does State the motor vehicle used
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
by the contract carrier passengers shall
 
01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
bear a valid state inspe inspection
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
sticker I've always assumed that you
 
01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:26.679 align:start position:0%
know the the buses must be inspected um
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
if you have an officer that's familiar
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
with that uh I'd appreciate hearing yeah
 
01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:32.679 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely and I think I can I can
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that and and if we need to he
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
can also chime in um but commercial
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles specifically Interstate
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles that go out of state are not
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
specifically required to get a New
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state inspection they are
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
required to have an annual inspections
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
that that meets the federal safety
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
standards and and uh it's a little bit
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
different it doesn't have to be obtained
 
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire it can
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
also be obtained outside of the State of
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I think spe this
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
specifies that this would be subject to
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
well is that duplicating then what is
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
currently being
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
done um I can tell you that school bus
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh school buses themselves obtain they
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
have a specific school bus inspection
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
certificate as
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.109 align:start position:0%
certificate as
well

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
but let's say take a CO a conquer coach
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
for example that they they get the
 
01:41:27.599 --> 01:41:29.109 align:start position:0%
for example that they they get the
federal

01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
inspection and they meet that safety
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
standard then by requiring to have some
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
kind of a New Hampshire inspection like
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
we all do for our residential vehicles
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
our private Vehicles is that going to be
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
a duplication and an additional cost
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
which is just another cost and doesn't
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
and and is trying to comp is the same
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing the sa the federal safety
 
01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.070 align:start position:0%
thing the sa the federal safety
inspection

01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
is and uh I can get back to you on that
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
um because again I'm not
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
sure um I'm not sure of the answer to
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
the question so uh let me just write it
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
down and I'll get back to you on that
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be a duplicate or
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
whether one can uh can take place of the
 
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
other thank you very much
 
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
sure have you heard of any issues where
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
there have been situations dealing with
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
the commercial bus drivers that have
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
been abusive or or caused some rationale
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
that you know that we don't want them
 
01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.030 align:start position:0%
that you know that we don't want them
around

01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
kids uh well I I think it's important to
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
clarify that currently there are no
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions for school districts to be
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
able to contract with private um motor
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
coach companies to um to transport kids
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
for school related
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
activities um so I think what Senator
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
Khan is trying to do is provide the
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities for schools to be able to
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
do that and I think that was um that was
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
why um he he introduced this bill so
 
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
currently any transportation related to
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
school related activities that's
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
contracted by the school is required to
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
utilize the yellow school buses and
 
01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
certified school bus drivers
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
so oh go ahead I think that I heard a
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
question there well I I I think I heard
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
some rumbling too repent B was that you
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah just a point we know they're doing
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
it school district are hiring coaches to
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
go on on Sports trips to Washington DC
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
to other longdistance trips so I I I
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't understand your your comment there
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
because school districts are doing
 
01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
they've been doing it forever so I don't
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand your does statute allow them
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
rph so I can tell you that there are
 
01:44:00.990 --> 01:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
currently no statutory or administrative
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions that allow the schools to do
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
that well and and I think if I may Mr
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I think this is the question
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
that the industry is Raising around this
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
bill and that based upon what uh Ralph
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
has just said that they are kind of
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
doing this as a favor uh to school
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
districts not
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
withstanding um what uh Elizabeth is
 
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
saying and that if in fact this piece of
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
legislation were to be enacted that they
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
would in fact stop doing that as a favor
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
to school districts and I think that's
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
their concern yeah right repres Hopson
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
you have a question I don't have a
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
question I have H someone from the
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
attendee list Sergeant Christopher
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
Kelby I don't know is he with DMV I'm
 
01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:51.990 align:start position:0%
Kelby I don't know is he with DMV I'm
not

01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
sure okay so can I promote Elizabeth buy
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh would it be fine for you to have your
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
DMV Sergeant
 
01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:03.719 align:start position:0%
speak yes absolutely Sergeant Kelby was
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
actually in charge of Pupil
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation so he might be able to
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
answer some of your questions related to
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement or what he's seeing on the
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
road some of the questions that you had
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
previously including the inspection
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
questions as well thank you Elizabeth
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
Sergeant up so we can
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
Cal you don't thank you you're welcome
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I got kicked off of the uh call
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
can you guys hear me all right yes we
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
can okay um I I just wanted to reiterate
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
what director Bley said in regards to uh
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh relative to motor coaches
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
transporting kids it it's it's not
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
allowed uh that school School
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
departments choose to utilize those
 
01:46:02.669 --> 01:46:02.679 align:start position:0%
resources they're doing so under the law
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
or outside of the law 26329 and 25996
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
specifically St State the how how
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
children are to be transported so I just
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify the air that though
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
there might be schooled uh sius
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
utilizing motor coaches for the
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
transportation of children it's illegal
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and more importantly is it puts the
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
SAU um in in a in a in a serious quandry
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to liability of something
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
should happen so to to answer the
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
inspection question uh no there would
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
not be an incurred cost uh outside of
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
the uh safety inspection for the vehicle
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
currently St uh school buses in the
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um regardless of
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
size have at a minimum two State safety
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
inspections done a year one is a state
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
safety inspection uh and over I think
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
it's 15,000 pounds uh they're they're
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
they're actually inspected twice a year
 
01:47:02.109 --> 01:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
uh and they're also subject to a school
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
bus safety inspection which is separate
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
from the state safety inspection and
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
they're given us a sticker uh indicating
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
that they passed the school bus safety
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
inspection so a full-size school bus
 
01:47:15.589 --> 01:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
would actually be State safety inspected
 
01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
three times uh a motor coach would fall
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
under its gen it's its annual inspection
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
requirement whatever that happens to be
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
it would not be something that the state
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.229 --> 01:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much Sergeant
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
are there questions for sergeant
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
Kelby yes represent
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you the sergeant I'm
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
assuming or maybe unfortunately you've
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
been listening to all this dialogue for
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
the last 40 minutes uh M if you have
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
been you understand the intent of what
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do trying to get in a
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
situation where everyone is legal and
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
everyone is safe
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any recommendations on
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
how that might happen based on what you
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
heard so I I I can tell you that the
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety is is neutral on
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
this uh I've heard a lot of concern
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
about putting in uh maybe uh you know um
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
some kind of hardship on uh motor coach
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
drivers or companies that are
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
transporting kids um outside of the uh
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know for for whatever uh trip
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
currently again just to point out it's
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
illegal they're not allowed to do this
 
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
we're not imposing anything on them
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
currently we're saying if you want to
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
transport kids you have to undergo the
 
01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:31.719 align:start position:0%
background check and the training the
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
training is 10 hours it's it's not a uh
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
a real you know you know they can
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
contract trainers uh there's first aid
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
training involved with that uh safe and
 
01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
un you know what what is safe loading H
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
you know how can the kids be you know
 
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
taken off the bus safely I mean it's
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
important training um again pointing out
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
that currently if you use you know Joe's
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
motor coach service down in I don't know
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth to transport a kid a group of
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
kids from from Portsmouth to to whever
 
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's illegal you can't do that unless
 
01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:10.910 align:start position:0%
it's illegal you can't do that unless
under

01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
25996 you submit uh the information to
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
the department uh for criminal and motor
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle background check and and again
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
pointing pointing out that the
 
01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:20.669 align:start position:0%
pointing pointing out that the
background

01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
check and the training is regulated by
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety Division of
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
State Police Division of Motor Vehicles
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
we are the ones that that do that the
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and the saus
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
have their own um requirements outside
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
of these parameters so um I just wanted
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear on that followup
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad yes you may thank you
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
sir uh side last question for me andal
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do the coach vehicles have
 
01:49:48.119 --> 01:49:49.109 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do the coach vehicles have
rear

01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
rear
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:53.149 align:start position:0%
rear
exits

01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
you know I I I am I I I try not to to
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
advertize this because I don't like
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
getting my hands dirty uh after 23 years
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
on the job I'm not a big fan of getting
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
my hands greasy but I am a certified
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
Federal inspector and um I am actually
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
motor coach certified and most of the
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
buses have evacuation windows and then
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the um side entry and that's it um
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
some depending on the design of the
 
01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.669 align:start position:0%
some depending on the design of the
vehicle

01:50:20.669 --> 01:50:20.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
um some of the buses have you know a
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
variety again it's it's really design
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
specific um there's so many square
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
inches of evacuation place that are
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
space that are needed on a on a motor
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
coach I know that's not answering your
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
question but that's as well as I can
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
answer it well I appreciate you using
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
the rag and wipe your hands on that
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
youer uh thank you Mr chair Sergeant we
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know we've acknowledged uh in this
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
hearing in this work session that in
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
fact motor coaches are in fact being
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
used um not withstanding it being quote
 
01:51:01.470 --> 01:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
illegal um so the question that I have
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
is that without any kind of
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
Statute that governs the use of these
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
motor coaches if there were to be an
 
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
accident if there were to be some kind
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
of a an incident with these motor
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
coaches with students from a school
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
district on them what's the liability
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
here because we have I mean there there
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
is a history here of these motor coaches
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
taking athletic teams uh places and
 
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
being hit by a semi Tru or whatever what
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
is the liability of uh without a law
 
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
governing this what's the liability of
 
01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
governing this what's the liability of
an

01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
SAU I I really I I could tell you that
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
would be up to the individual court all
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell you is that RSA
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
296 specifically States
 
01:51:53.709 --> 01:51:53.719 align:start position:0%
what you need to do to drive a vehicle
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
if you fall outside of that I don't know
 
01:51:57.149 --> 01:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
that that falls under court and the
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
legal system and I'm not I could not
 
01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.470 align:start position:0%
legal system and I'm not I could not
answer

01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
that thank you you're welcome sir thank
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
leus yes back to the question of
 
01:52:16.589 --> 01:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
um if we pass legislation allowing
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
schools to use motor
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
coaches and they're going a long
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
distance so they have to trade drivers
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
potentially more than one time how does
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
that work if we're requiring New
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
certification so as I read the law um if
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to transport students in
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you have to submit under
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
25996 the uh training and background
 
01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
check which is the roster so we already
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
know that you're driving for a kid so if
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
C&amp;J Trailways was going to do a trip
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
down to DC or something and they're
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to be driving more than I think
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's 14 hours or something like that um
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
under log book regulations presumably
 
01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
the uh C&amp;J Trailways would have another
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
driver um that would be on the bus to do
 
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
the switch driving or take the
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate time off to utilize another
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
employee of a new another bus company
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the State of New Hampshire we
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to enforce anything
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that you know there's no way for us
 
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
to know that but I I don't think it
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
would be uh realistic for a a motor
 
01:53:36.430 --> 01:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
coach uh to utilize another driver from
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
another location another company to
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
drive um you know on a longdistance trip
 
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
much like most motor carriers currently
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
if they have uh if they're team driving
 
01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
the the drivers work for the same
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
service I'm not saying it's not it's not
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
possible that they could utilize you
 
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
know some you know you know Sister
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
service from another state to do that um
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that would really fall you know
 
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
aside from them not not stating staying
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
within the law as it would be or the
 
01:54:05.719 --> 01:54:06.870 align:start position:0%
within the law as it would be or the
amended

01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislation you know again I mean we
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
can't really just like you guys use
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
motor coaches now there's one Trooper in
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that is 100%
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
dedicated to people
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation one person that's
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
it so his job is primarily
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
administrative and investigation of
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
accidents for him to go out and police
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
these locations and and I've spoken to
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
many superintendents many principles
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
about the uh legality of using motor
 
01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:37.719 align:start position:0%
coaches you know we try to get it out
 
01:54:40.109 --> 01:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
there hey don't do this God forbid if
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
something bad happens you're falling a
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
file of State New Hampshire law that I
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
would have presume there would be some
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
some some liability involved with that
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
um you know we can only enforce what we
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
can see presumably um if if if the
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
amended uh legislation is as it's
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
proposed goes into effect I would assume
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
that a motor carrier would be utilizing
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
for a long trip uh drivers of that same
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
location or or company to provide that
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation well when I when I've
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
seen that happen it was the same company
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
but a different state and so that's my
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
question how are they going to have New
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state bus
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
drivers uh
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
certification if they're being picked up
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
in another state through the same
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
company well
 
01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we again presumably it's a school
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's a particular
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
SAU um so we're only
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
regulating the the the kids being picked
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
up by New Hampshire um saus so we have a
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
lot of companies in Massachusetts and
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont actually that provide
 
01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
transportation services to uh saus and
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state um while having an
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
out of-state driver's license and it's
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
just a matter of them being certified in
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it's it's
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's not that hard it's just a matter of
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know having an instructor provide
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
the 10 hours of training again presuming
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
that the legislation's passed and
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
presuming that everybody follows the law
 
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be that hard for them to do
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
that I know first student and uh student
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
transportation of America have locations
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh Butler's bus service nrt they all
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
have bus uh bus services outside of
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
state and they have backup drivers that
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
that will pick up um you know if if they
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
have a driver that's out sick uh we we
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
provide transportation in the state of
 
01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:41.910 align:start position:0%
provide transportation in the state of
New

01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Sergeant ke uh Kelby
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
um it appears that one of the primary
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for this bill coming for forward
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
was is the legality and liability
 
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
issues um we're requiring in this
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
legislation as I see it about five
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
things the first four uh that the B the
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
commercial uh vehicle have a valed state
 
01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.350 align:start position:0%
commercial uh vehicle have a valed state
inspection

01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
sticker and comply with the provisions
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
of RSA
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
376 the bus driver hold a valid
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
CDL and the school bus and a
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh school bus driver certificate defined
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
by RSA 263 colon
 
01:57:28.589 --> 01:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
29 this bill we could take care of the
 
01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
legality and
 
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
liability by just uh deleting the part
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
that says a school bus driver
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
certificate find in RSA 263 colon
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
29 um would would that make the buses
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.149 --> 01:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
safe I'm gonna I would ask the director
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
to to respond to that um I I don't think
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
that that I would be the right person to
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
to respond to that I do want to point
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
out that um yes that was very politic um
 
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
the SBC the school bus certificate and
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
the CDL uh license the director just
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
responded she would take the that that
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
question are two different things so
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
currently Chris Kelby myself I I possess
 
01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.629 align:start position:0%
currently Chris Kelby myself I I possess
a

01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:15.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
cdla with a uh tank endorsement a motor
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
coach endorsement and a school bus
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
endorsement but I am not allowed to get
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel and of a yellow school
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
bus and drive it on a school operation
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
the school bus certificate is a separate
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh document it's not an endorsement it's
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
a sec it's a certificate that and and
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that that we have companies
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
out there that use Ford focuses as
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
school buses because they fall under the
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
law uh they all they need is a driver's
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
license and an SBC card or School Bus
 
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
certificate card and that's the 10
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
question um exam that they have to take
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'm sorry the 20 question exam
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
that they have to take to the DMV uh
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
with the 10 hours of training so again I
 
01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:02.679 align:start position:0%
the director did just chime in that she
 
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
would answer that question i' I'd rather
 
01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
just fill myself from that that's okay
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay thanks Sergeant yes sir uh thank
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
you for the question and representative
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
I will say again that um that was really
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
something that Senator Khan intended to
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
ensure that the provisions that he's
 
01:59:21.629 --> 01:59:21.639 align:start position:0%
introducing really mirror the school bus
 
01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
um certificate I know he worked very
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
closely with a superintendent out of the
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
um Keen School District I believe but
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
also with the school bus or School
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
transportation Association so um again
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
why while we were helping him draft it
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
he was really driving the intent and
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
this was the intent that the drivers
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
really meet the same requirements on the
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
motor coaches as they do um for school
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
bus certificate as
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you very
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
much are there further questions on on
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
this or discussion on this bill on part
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
three yes represent Woodcock yeah the
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
last last comment on this um out of all
 
02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:06.750 align:start position:0%
last last comment on this um out of all
the

02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
dialogue the thing that scares me the
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
most representative lad is the fact that
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
we just realized that these motor
 
02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:17.719 align:start position:0%
coaches do not have a safety exit one of
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
the uh PL me of New Hampshire school
 
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
administrator's job was to uh uh
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
participate in the emergency exiting
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
practices from school buses which I did
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
multiple times every year and the and
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
organizes so the kids come off the back
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
they they know the orderly procedure the
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
whole things the fact that we're now
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
aware beyond the school bus legality
 
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
piece of these coach buses that don't
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
have a rear emergency exit nor do the
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
student students have they have the
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
window nor do the students have a chance
 
02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
to practice that that to me is the
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
biggest scare that's illuminated by this
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
whole Bill thank you so then let me ask
 
02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
you a question then uh representative
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
whitcock are you saying then you would
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have us use the commercial
 
02:01:10.589 --> 02:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
carriers no I'm not saying that because
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have a from that my point is
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative lad that I think this
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
commercial carrier uh we just opened a
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
huge can of worms and the biggest one is
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
safety of the students emergency without
 
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
practice excelling and I understand the
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
seu 29 issues um that they brought up
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
before and and all the school buses the
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
youngsters in the middle schools go to
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
the DC I understand all that but this I
 
02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
did not
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the driver is less concerning
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
me than this I did not recognize that
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
the safety provision of student exting
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
and practicing is so limited to a window
 
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
in one of those coaches um that that
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
makes me very very nervous that's all
 
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
thank wouldn't this would couldn't we
 
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish that in this bill by
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
requiring prior to that commercial bus
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
being used that the CDL D the
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
driver uh inform the students on the bus
 
02:02:06.910 --> 02:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the the certified teacher
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
or coach or employee on that bus here
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
are the exit points just as you do when
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
you get on a
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
airplane uh you're you're you're told
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know we can all go through that
 
02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
routine uh would be just would that
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
satisfy rather than saying to the
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
contract carriers you now have to have
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
your drivers have this
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
certificate which we know that there is
 
02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:36.679 align:start position:0%
a lack of uh qualified folks out there
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
with CDLs especially with the oil crisis
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
we have going on right now and we know
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
with school buses drivers as well I
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
represent I understand what you're
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
saying and having them speak you know
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
the left in the air things will come
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
down like an airplane all the big exits
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is not this the driver saying
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
the rear window and the far right that
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
has a signo that's what you crawl out of
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
my thing is you have to take sixth and
 
02:03:03.069 --> 02:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
seventh graders in freshman high school
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
and have them practice it so they can
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
learn it they not gonna in the case of
 
02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
emergency they not gonna be able to go
 
02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
through that everybody going that one
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
window I think this opens up a huge bag
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
of worms that's just
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
me you have your hand up uh thank you Mr
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
chair I actually one of the conquer
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
Trailways down to Boston every day for
 
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
years and years and years uh there are a
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
ton of exits in there distributed
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the bus I know the students
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
won't have a chance to open them up and
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
jump out which would probably be a lot
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
of fun but they're they're throughout
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
the bus and and they're really easy to
 
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
handles okay we're practice makes
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
practice makes perfect you can't do it
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
by just talking about it not with kids
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
that's why we coach
 
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
teams all right uh not a lot of fun
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
during an emergency
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
either okay thank you very much all are
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on on
 
02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.310 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on on
this

02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill I want to thank the yes represent
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
luno yeah Rick
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
um uh I you know I I agree with a lot of
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
what's what's been said uh on here and I
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
think um you know particularly what
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
Steve brought up that this is really
 
02:04:18.199 --> 02:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
Steve brought up that this is really
uncovered

02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
uncovered
 
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
I think a um a liability issue that
 
02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
every school district across the state
 
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
um uh probably would face and you know
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
12 years on a school board I had no idea
 
02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
that that um that this was um uh uh not
 
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh not was was basically an illegal
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
activity uh for the schools and so now
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've all heard this and um and the
 
02:04:48.030 --> 02:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
department representative has also heard
 
02:04:49.629 --> 02:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
this um
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
and and I think there's there's clearly
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
complexities here um but but I think
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's two parts that we need to do um
 
02:05:03.149 --> 02:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
or that we should consider is is um
 
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
relieving the LI at least District
 
02:05:08.109 --> 02:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
liability so that they can at least
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
continue to um you know have the ninth
 
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
grade field trip to Washington and not
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
ride a big yellow bus you know for that
 
02:05:19.549 --> 02:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
and uh and secondly try to try to come
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
to some um U good um
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
um try to put together some good statute
 
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
that that is um
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
um that is enforcable that is realistic
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
and and I think even some of the things
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
you suggested Rick make a lot of sense
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
um maybe as a starting point but but I
 
02:05:43.629 --> 02:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're going to be able to
 
02:05:47.229 --> 02:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
solve this one completely today so um
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
but it's clearly something that needs to
 
02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:50.270 align:start position:0%
but it's clearly something that needs to
be

02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you yeah there are two
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
parts there Dave um one is the legality
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
and the liability that that can be
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
easily dealt with I think just by the
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
part uh under number one Roman one um
 
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
that that can occur um the other issue
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
is the safety issues which represent
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
Woodcock brings up and and the training
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
um that is a little bit more complex and
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
ter are
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
resolving uh
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know we may have time if
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to craft some language uh
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
to you know to try to address that but
 
02:06:33.629 --> 02:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think we're going to be able
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
to do it I concur that
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
quickly further further
 
02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this one I want to yes
 
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
represent like this yeah so what do
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
people think if two changes on looking
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
looking at um in part one where it says
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
a valid state inspection stier if we
 
02:06:56.639 --> 02:06:58.149 align:start position:0%
a valid state inspection stier if we
included

02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
or whatever the name of the federal
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
inspection sticker that um a lot of the
 
02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
bus you know the coaches would have to
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
have whatever that's called so that they
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
either had a state one or that Federal
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
one which says they've been inspected
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
and everything um and then the other
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
thing would be what if we uh
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
um took out the school bus driver's
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
certificate left all the rest but took
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
that particular piece out as a
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
requirement because then schools could
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
go on doing what they've been doing
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
which is sending kids to DC on those
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
coach buses which they've been doing all
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
along and that way they they are
 
02:07:44.589 --> 02:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
covered and having the other
 
02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
requirements you know most of them it
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
makes sense anyways it just to me
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense that they would have
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
to have the school driver's certificate
 
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
especially if they're having to trade
 
02:08:01.549 --> 02:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
drivers in in doing that uh Alicia you'd
 
02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
have to also look at Roman
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
three uh which again looks at the uh bus
 
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
driver certificate requirements what I
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
was talking about ran three the school
 
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
bus driver certificate requirement just
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
take that out and in Roman one
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
add or that Federal inspection sticker
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
whatever that is I I would have to find
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
out but instead of just a valid state
 
02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:31.069 align:start position:0%
out but instead of just a valid state
inspection

02:08:31.069 --> 02:08:31.079 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
sticker what would people think about if
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
we just modified those two things well
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
you'd also have to take out in Roman one
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
the reference to RSA 263 col 29 it's in
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
two places in that
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill oh I see
 
02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
yeah y so okay take it out of both of
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
those places so Rick I I think that I
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
think what what Alicia is suggesting um
 
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
makes makes some sense in terms of a
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
stop Gap um but but I think we we
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to make some make some
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
progress on on the rest of it um as well
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
and um and you know to to uh to assure
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
um you know that the kids are safe
 
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
during an emergency and I don't know
 
02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
what the answer is on on those I don't
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
know if you want to um add I mean we can
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
study it this fall um and and actually
 
02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
hear from you know the the
 
02:09:37.229 --> 02:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
representatives of the commercial car
 
02:09:40.990 --> 02:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
commercial lines and um and Department
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
of Safety and DMV and and um Department
 
02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
of Ed and put that works there there's
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
there's several tacks in doing this um
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
one I think we can take care of
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
immediately the legality and liability
 
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
issue that can be done through modifying
 
02:10:03.069 --> 02:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
the first section that represent leus
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
was looking at uh in in Roman one the
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
issue of of the safety on the bus is
 
02:10:13.390 --> 02:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
that also related to maybe having uh
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
somebody an employee also on the bus or
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
somebody that's a teacher on on the bus
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
that is you know is able to U work with
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
kids and maintain the decorum the safety
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
that you normally have on a school bus
 
02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
when on a field trip um uh so you know
 
02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
in the short run possibly you know we
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
can correct the one area um it's
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
possible that we could also then come
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
back with legislation to clean up the
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
rest of it uh in the second year of this
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:48.830 align:start position:0%
rest of it uh in the second year of this
bium

02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
bium
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah absolutely agree with you Rick
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
um something is better than something
 
02:10:57.870 --> 02:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
has to be done nothing is not an option
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
well the the legality has to be yeah
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so so perhaps what we could do
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
is have a couple folks get together here
 
02:11:09.549 --> 02:11:09.559 align:start position:0%
and try to come up with some language
 
02:11:12.549 --> 02:11:12.559 align:start position:0%
which might be you know the intermediate
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
step here and then following through
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
with those considerations dealing with
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
the safety issue
 
02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
and the proper training on supervision
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
on the bus yeah the elephant on the
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
table has to be addressed representative
 
02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
lad that's the key
 
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
issue well I see the key issue is the
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
liability and legality and that's a huge
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
issue for a district
 
02:11:40.589 --> 02:11:40.599 align:start position:0%
right yeah it is it is it is huge
 
02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative but I'm not sure it is as
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
huge as 20 kids stuck on a bus emergency
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
and can't get out so I think I think
 
02:11:50.589 --> 02:11:50.599 align:start position:0%
both both pieces have to be done but
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
there I just say the elephants on the
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
table is out with public we need to
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
address it if someone
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
does right but current current statute
 
02:12:02.549 --> 02:12:02.559 align:start position:0%
addresses neither of those right so
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
anything we do is going to be better
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
than what there is right now
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
right Reon Hopson yeah may I let
 
02:12:14.189 --> 02:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
Sergeant Kelby
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
and the meeting we oh yeah we yeah yes
 
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh for sergeant Kelby and Elizabeth
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
deluy thank you very much for listening
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
to this um is there anybody here on our
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
committee that be interested in Alicia
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
you you were there you with part of this
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
are are you willing to try to work with
 
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
others or or develop something yourself
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
which would address you know step one
 
02:12:46.109 --> 02:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
and step two is is a a bigger picture I
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
think right and and we might even be
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
able to put some one line in this one
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
that just requires that um the bus
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
driver goes over
 
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
safety you know the safety instructions
 
02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
or whatever before you the bus pulls out
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
well I think it's also important that
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
there be some kind of a teacher
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
certification on that bus or an employee
 
02:13:12.910 --> 02:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
of the school district on the bus I
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
don't know of any schools that hire
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
conquered coaches or whatever coach that
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
don't put other adults on I mean I've
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
never heard of them doing
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
that I I
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
concur so I think the more important
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
thing is just to make those coaches
 
02:13:33.310 --> 02:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
legal and if we can right now just put a
 
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
oneliner in about covering the different
 
02:13:38.549 --> 02:13:38.559 align:start position:0%
safety on the bus and
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
then go in detail hopefully Stephen
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're willing to go into detail and
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
come up with a law for next year to add
 
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
to this well I I'd be happy to work on
 
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
that um on behalf of the committee I
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
would suggest if we require students to
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
practice exiting school buses through
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
emergency exits that we need to have
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps practice on any vehicle they're
 
02:14:04.109 --> 02:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
going to be on in the coach that's to
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
the general question representa leas I'd
 
02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to work on this with you or
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
whoever represent L put on it good okay
 
02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
how about if we set up a working group
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
of represent Woodcock and and representa
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
leus to try to address
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
what we've gone over today is that good
 
02:14:20.639 --> 02:14:21.950 align:start position:0%
what we've gone over today is that good
with

02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
you she back by
 
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
you she back by
2023

02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
no I think we need to address this
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
legality liability issue immediately
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
right yeah so you could look at Roman
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
one there and you could put a period
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
right after CDL commercial driver's
 
02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
license period and then uh look at three
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe you delete three so you'd have
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know Roman 1 and Roman two uh that's
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
just my quick fast look but there there
 
02:14:56.910 --> 02:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
may be some other you know things that
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
you two could come up and make a
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation to us later on next
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
week next
 
02:15:07.629 --> 02:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
year okay okay Alicia that's fine with
 
02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
me okay you two get together set up
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
Steve I'll be happy to and I think you
 
02:15:15.709 --> 02:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
had some really good points I think we
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
need to figure out how to work them in
 
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank good let's get on now to um
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
part four of this this bill I want to
 
02:15:28.109 --> 02:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
thank everybody that was listening and
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
helped us out with this
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
today part four is uh a state aid to
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
special education for certain
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
communities of a thousand or fewer
 
02:15:39.679 --> 02:15:42.790 align:start position:0%
communities of a thousand or fewer
residents

02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I had I had some concern
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
with this uh let me briefly state that I
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
I know that we already provide uh
 
02:15:56.910 --> 02:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
$250,000 um annually for the districts
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
which are unable to um uh pay for some
 
02:16:03.149 --> 02:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
of the costs of unexpected emergencies
 
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with the special education Aid
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's the catastrophic Aid the student
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
that comes in that's the high cost
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
student they may not have a reserve fund
 
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
most districts do have some but it's a
 
02:16:18.669 --> 02:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
very expensive cost deal we've talked
 
02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
about it many
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
times this bill also then goes beyond
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
and says an additional
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
$250,000 available for um any Community
 
02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
or community of a thousand or fewer
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
residents um so uh with that that that
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
that total comes up to $500,000 to me
 
02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
and and there is no definition I found
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the word Community municipality
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
District yes um not community and I know
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about unincorporated areas
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
probably most likely and we have several
 
02:16:59.790 --> 02:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
of them hail's location Hearts
 
02:17:04.589 --> 02:17:04.599 align:start position:0%
location uh yeah hails yeah haes and
 
02:17:07.309 --> 02:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
hearts uh so
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I understand that
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
predicament so it's open to discussion
 
02:17:12.719 --> 02:17:15.910 align:start position:0%
predicament so it's open to discussion
right

02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
Cornell okay so I thank you for taking
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
my question chair the lines 29 and 30
 
02:17:31.389 --> 02:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
the impact of special Le cost when
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
emergency assistance is necessary to
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
prevent significant financial harm um
 
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
what how do you decide that it's doing
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
significant financial harm I mean a a
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
community of a thousand or less may have
 
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
one student man Chester has
 
02:17:54.030 --> 02:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
56 students that using the old term of
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid would qualify so I mean
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
I think 56 students would make
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester eligible for a significant
 
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
financial harm I'm just wondering what
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
What's the de definition of how do you
 
02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
decide that it's causing the community
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
of a thousand significant financial harm
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to another Community that's
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
over 000 that may have many many many
 
02:18:20.519 --> 02:18:25.150 align:start position:0%
over 000 that may have many many many
more

02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
students the the that's always been
 
02:18:30.030 --> 02:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
resolved by the Department of Education
 
02:18:34.830 --> 02:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
to discern that uh I do not honestly
 
02:18:37.349 --> 02:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
know the criteria that they use for that
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
decision making for the current
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:51.870 align:start position:0%
 
situations

02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
um I know that there are small districts
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
that do encounter this type of hardship
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
well yes R Celli yes thank you Mr
 
02:19:15.309 --> 02:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
chairman um um based on some
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
correspondence with the uh
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
Department um I believe it is a rule
 
02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
that outlines applications for
 
02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
emergency applications for emergency
 
02:19:32.589 --> 02:19:32.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility and what the document
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
shall entail um and that U
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
includes um
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
unanticipated cost uh financial crisis
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
they could not be dealt with through um
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
budgetary line item transfers or other
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
financial management
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
techniques um and that there are no
 
02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
other sources of financial support
 
02:19:57.070 --> 02:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
available to assist the district so I
 
02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
think that this uh definitely uh relates
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
to a small District more so than uh a
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
larger District who is going to have a
 
02:20:09.870 --> 02:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
larger budget from which they can uh
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
draw resources as opposed to the small
 
02:20:14.770 --> 02:20:14.780 align:start position:0%
District of under a thousand
 
02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.349 align:start position:0%
District of under a thousand
[Music]

02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:20:16.359 --> 02:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
[Music]
students

02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's in rule right
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
now uh but as far as making the actual
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
decision you have to use that criteria
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
decision represent
 
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
Woodcock represent lad um just two
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh Rick if I may can you can
 
02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
you give me the um um to the the the
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
last line on line 29 I'm looking at the
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
pl say when emergency
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
assistance I don't I don't know how
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's Define I understand uh Patty
 
02:20:59.469 --> 02:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
talking about catastrophic Aid and Glenn
 
02:21:00.990 --> 02:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't understand how that
 
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
means emergency assistance is that
 
02:21:06.190 --> 02:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's the first question the second one
 
02:21:08.429 --> 02:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
just on behalf of Representative Tanner
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
who's not with us today she'd asked at
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing um how does this impact uh
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
Regional uh uh Co-op school districts I
 
02:21:20.349 --> 02:21:20.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if we have an answer to
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
you okay the um the first part of that
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
you asked uh emergency assistance of
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
course in terms of it's emergency
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
financial assistance our fundings are
 
02:21:39.070 --> 02:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
assistance basically to mitigate the
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
impact of special education
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
costs um you know little permont
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
received kids two in one year both at
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
$250,000 approximately fees of course
 
02:21:54.510 --> 02:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
that's some of that's reimbursable
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
through the formula but it still went to
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
the point where they didn't but they had
 
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal to take it from other
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
accounts and other sources that they had
 
02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
so that would not be necessarily an
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
emergency funding Assistance or need um
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
there there must be some districts like
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
the two I mentioned to begin with at
 
02:22:17.790 --> 02:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
least one of them
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
where that does occur um and this other
 
02:22:24.590 --> 02:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
criteria is that you have a thousand or
 
02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:26.469 align:start position:0%
criteria is that you have a thousand or
fewer

02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
fewer
 
02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
residents well we all know there's some
 
02:22:31.230 --> 02:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
towns a thousand or less that are B
 
02:22:33.309 --> 02:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
residents that are very very property
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
wealthy towns
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
correct correct yeah you know I can name
 
02:22:42.750 --> 02:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
a couple Monroe Waterville
 
02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
a couple Monroe Waterville
Valley

02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
Valley
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh just to the the second question
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative L the follow the co-op
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
the co-op school districts do you ever
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
do we ever get a good response for that
 
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't have an answer to that one
 
02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
does anybody here represent Porter I
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
don't really have an answer I do have a
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
concern however because here in
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro we have the Hillsboro Dearing
 
02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
district and we have little Windsor who
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
has maybe 400 residents that sends their
 
02:23:24.910 --> 02:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
children to our school they don't have a
 
02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
school of their own they do have a
 
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
school board and they have a small
 
02:23:30.030 --> 02:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
budget but they don't have a school of
 
02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
their own so if a child moves into that
 
02:23:35.950 --> 02:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
District that cost is absorbed by
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro Dearing school district and we
 
02:23:40.030 --> 02:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
also have Washington which does have its
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
own School up to the fifth grade but
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
then those children come down to the
 
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
hillsb Dearing school and and if if a
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
speci special needs childood that's
 
02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
expensive that's something that has to
 
02:23:52.269 --> 02:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
be taken on by our district although
 
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro has you know 7,000 people that
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
live in it so you know it's a confusing
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
to me very confusing um situation that
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
we would be in to get would would we
 
02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
qualify we do have some reserves for
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
special weed but certainly not enough if
 
02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
we had two or three kids move in so just
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
just a reiterating what people are
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
work meent cordelli thank you uh yes um
 
02:24:26.910 --> 02:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
further my discussion with the
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
Department on this um a town that sends
 
02:24:36.429 --> 02:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
their students uh to another District
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
that town I.E school district is
 
02:24:42.990 --> 02:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the uh cost of that
 
02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
student they're sending tuition money to
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
that Co-op who of the district under a
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
tuition in agreement um they therefore
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
would be uh responsible for the extra
 
02:24:56.269 --> 02:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
cost associated with a special Edge
 
02:24:58.750 --> 02:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
student who moved into the district such
 
02:25:01.630 --> 02:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
as representative Porter I think was
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
making reference to it or I think um
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
under the um situation that was laid out
 
02:25:12.269 --> 02:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
by uh the prime sponsor Senator grad um
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that small
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
District um uh part of a co-op or
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
tuition agreement would be responsible
 
02:25:23.469 --> 02:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
for the special ed cost and would have a
 
02:25:27.710 --> 02:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
difficult time and possibly financial
 
02:25:30.990 --> 02:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
crisis in dealing with a high cost
 
02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:38.269 --> 02:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
needs repr
 
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
Porter I'm not sure how that would work
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
for Windsor for example would Windsor
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
apply to the state for this emergency
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
Aid they don't have a an office they
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a school um they use the SAU
 
02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
for all that so would Windsor be the one
 
02:25:58.830 --> 02:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
that would apply for that Aid or would
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
the Hillsboro deing School District be
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
the one that applied for that Aid seeing
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
as how the child is a student and
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
Windsor go ahead um if if Windsor is
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
paying the educational cost for that
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
student they would likewise be
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for the specialed uh student
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
um costs um and therefore I I would
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
imagine um fill out the uh application
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
for emergency
 
02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
assistance that is correct for example
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have Benton that's in SAU
 
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
23 and Benton does not have schools they
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
send all their kids to Woodsville but
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
there was a child there that was a high
 
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
cost special ed student and Benton then
 
02:26:50.710 --> 02:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
went and checked out the cost and they
 
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
found it was actually cheaper to send
 
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
their that student to another school
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
district and the costs though were
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
totally on the Benton taxpayers to do
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
that um within your Co-op District you
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
know we have the same thing with with
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
permont which is part of
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
sa23 um they they have to cough up all
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
that that funding in your little town of
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about represent Porter
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
would have to come up with those dollars
 
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
that's why that pot of $250,000 is
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
qualify yes so so um thank you Mr chair
 
02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
along those lines though um I think the
 
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
requirement for a district of residents
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for IEP costs is on
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements and um and
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
manifest hardship placements and things
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
like that I think what what what
 
02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative Porter is talking about
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
with Windsor as an example also is
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
specific to the co-op agreement that
 
02:27:55.309 --> 02:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
that the district has with the member
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
towns and it could be that they're just
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for whatever their Prat a
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
student share as opposed to specific IEP
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
costs for each student that that resides
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
in Windsor or Dearing or or Hillsboro
 
02:28:13.469 --> 02:28:13.479 align:start position:0%
and um and so uh you know so I I
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
I I I I think it could be the case as
 
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but it doesn't have
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
to be the case and um and it would be
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
important to to know this maybe um Miss
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
Fenton has um has some um clarification
 
02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
on on Co-op agreements around the state
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
but what could happen in in the the case
 
02:28:34.269 --> 02:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
that representative Porter is talking
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
about if in fact Windsor is not
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for every IEP dollar of
 
02:28:41.469 --> 02:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
every student in res residence in
 
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
Windsor they could collect the
 
02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and um and only have to be
 
02:28:51.269 --> 02:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for the um the Prat share as
 
02:28:56.670 --> 02:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
IEP is Diana Fenton there yes she is
 
02:29:02.110 --> 02:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
would you like me to if she can have any
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
this thank you Miss
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
available good good morning uh committee
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
members thank you for inviting me to
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
join you I'm going to defer to um
 
02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
Rebecca fet who's in charge of special
 
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
education uh she would probably know
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
more about this particular section of
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
cooperatives each one has their own
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
agreement we do have copies of them and
 
02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully this situation would be
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
addressed in those agreements but um I I
 
02:29:45.389 --> 02:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
can't speak to them all they're each
 
02:29:47.830 --> 02:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
individual and they they might not have
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
addressed this particular situation but
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to see if uh Rebecca fet I see
 
02:29:53.550 --> 02:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
that her name is popped up and ask that
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
you promote her and she can better uh
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
answer this question thank you she's
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
been promoted welcome to education M
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
forette morning Rebecca good morning
 
02:30:06.309 --> 02:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative lad thank you for U the
 
02:30:10.110 --> 02:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
question so as um as Miss Fenton said um
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
each School District makes a different
 
02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
agreement between them regarding special
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
education students so they may have an
 
02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
agreement where um they pay a certain
 
02:30:23.269 --> 02:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
rate per pupil and then they also have
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
an agreement where they pay a certain
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
rate for special education students or
 
02:30:30.510 --> 02:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
that cost refer um reverts back to the
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
district that is sending it so it's
 
02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
really um local control here um it's
 
02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
really what has that District determined
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
in their agreement with the district
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
they send their students to if they've
 
02:30:43.710 --> 02:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
agreed that um in some cases the
 
02:30:45.269 --> 02:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
whatever District they send them to is
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to incur all cost costs for every
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
kid that they send them to um then that
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
sending District wouldn't wouldn't incur
 
02:30:56.110 --> 02:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
any extra cost however typically what
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
happens is um they will say you're
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
paying this rate for this student
 
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
however if there's a paraprofessional or
 
02:31:05.550 --> 02:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
an outof District placement you the
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
district that is sending that student
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
would then incur that cost um and have
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
to cover that cost as well as the
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
tuition cost to the district but it it's
 
02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
different for district to District um
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's unfortunately it's not
 
02:31:21.469 --> 02:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
one blanket answer to say this is how it
 
02:31:26.349 --> 02:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
District Rebecca the statute States
 
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
right now that the state may designate
 
02:31:34.030 --> 02:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
up to
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
$250,000 uh for this purpose um have you
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
had uh school districts or small town
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
District uh come to requesting support
 
02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
from that pot of money and is there such
 
02:31:51.670 --> 02:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
a pot of money so as um I have only been
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
in my position for a year so I have
 
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
reached out to people who have been here
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
longer than I and um from what I
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand no one has ever asked to
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
access that pot up until um probably a
 
02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago we did have one
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
school district reach out to access that
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
however none of that money has ever been
 
02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
set aside um because that money is the
 
02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
same money that goes to special
 
02:32:15.150 --> 02:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
education Aid and what typically happens
 
02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
is we pay special education Aid out of
 
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
that first and then if there were more
 
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
then it it would have been set aside as
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
I understand it however we don't
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
typically pay full on special education
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
Aid um we did this year but we haven't
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
since 2008 so typically there isn't that
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
$250 left over um as I understand it
 
02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
it's never been set aside ahead of time
 
02:32:42.190 --> 02:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
so they've never taken that 250 off the
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
top and then done special education
 
02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
Aid so there's really never ever been
 
02:32:51.269 --> 02:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
enough money in a special education cat
 
02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid account and so the
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
money's been sprinkled over the total
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
number of kids which qualify for that um
 
02:33:03.309 --> 02:33:03.319 align:start position:0%
so in order to support this particular
 
02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph within statute we just be
 
02:33:09.269 --> 02:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
sprinkling fewer the same dollar out to
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know more directions uh
 
02:33:15.830 --> 02:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
it I guess the question is that I have
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
here is that if you haven't had folks
 
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
coming and asking for that
 
02:33:25.950 --> 02:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
$250,000 um do you know of any
 
02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
communities that would come and look for
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
that uh I could see some of the
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
communities that have to cover the
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
difference between um what the cap is
 
02:33:38.349 --> 02:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
and then what we start to cover for
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
special education Aid I could see some
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
of them reaching out to say um you know
 
02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
the cap of $50,000 we really can't
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
afford that and and then asking to cover
 
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
that piece but um the and the one one
 
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
incidence that um I've been told of
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
which I said was about a year and a half
 
02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
ago they had an unexpected student move
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
in and they did not have the funds to
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
cover um a residential placement for the
 
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
student so they were asking for funds to
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
help to cover that because it just was
 
02:34:08.990 --> 02:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
not in their budget to cover
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
it other further questions for
 
02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
Rebecca rep represent cordellia I'm
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
sorry it's not question
 
02:34:20.429 --> 02:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
okay if this a comment okay yeah I I
 
02:34:23.150 --> 02:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
think that that's exactly the situation
 
02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:24.469 align:start position:0%
think that that's exactly the situation
that

02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh relates to
 
02:34:33.389 --> 02:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
and the reason that Senator Bradley uh
 
02:34:36.670 --> 02:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
brought forward to accommodate that kind
 
02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:37.550 align:start position:0%
brought forward to accommodate that kind
of

02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
situation and I know specifically in our
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
County um H's location for instance is a
 
02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:49.640 align:start position:0%
small district has no school and sends
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
their students to
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
either tenet or to triberg
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
Academy and would
 
02:35:04.269 --> 02:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
be severely uh impacted um if they had
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
to pay for a special needs child who
 
02:35:13.269 --> 02:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
needed into the district um with high
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
cost small community
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know I I got a question for you then
 
02:35:23.309 --> 02:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
um Glen uh maybe you can help me out
 
02:35:25.469 --> 02:35:25.479 align:start position:0%
like a hailes location is in an
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
unincorporated Township right cor right
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
and and with that the county is the one
 
02:35:34.190 --> 02:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
County the one that's providing the
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
funds to support this district for
 
02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
funds to support this district for
hail's

02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
hail's
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
location uh no they they are not they
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
they have their own budget um the County
 
02:35:48.030 --> 02:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners act as the school board
 
02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
yeah for those unincorporated places um
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
but they uh they raise their uh they
 
02:35:57.630 --> 02:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
have their own budgets uh based on
 
02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
taxing their local residents
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
okay no hey Rick rep luno thank thanks
 
02:36:08.670 --> 02:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
very much um I'm I'm looking at the the
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
Dr um tax rate comparison from fy19
 
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
which is the most complete one they've
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
they've got on their their um the
 
02:36:18.910 --> 02:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
department website right now and just
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
looking at hail's location the total
 
02:36:25.469 --> 02:36:25.479 align:start position:0%
2019 total tax rate was
 
02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
$418 the total School tax rate well I'll
 
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
break it up the State education tax was
 
02:36:36.910 --> 02:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
$25 and the um and the local school tax
 
02:36:38.349 --> 02:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
was minus
 
02:36:40.830 --> 02:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
$215 so their school tax rate is
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually zero um in hail's
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
location so I I I guess I don't
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
understand diverting additional State
 
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
money um
 
02:36:55.230 --> 02:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
um where there you know you know you've
 
02:36:58.510 --> 02:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
got tax rates in Claremont of 40 plus
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
dollars and here you've got
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
zero okay yeah I was using Hil location
 
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
example I I I have no idea um you know
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
what situation um prompted this bill or
 
02:37:13.269 --> 02:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
if there was any specific situation
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
prompted this bill okay okay thanks very
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
much yeah we're just using that so it's
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
not attack in anybody of these you know
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
the small areas
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
yeah well I I guess I have one more
 
02:37:29.469 --> 02:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
question for
 
02:37:31.870 --> 02:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
Rebecca uh at the
 
02:37:34.750 --> 02:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
department uh is the
 
02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
$250,000 that's currently that may be
 
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
designated for to mitigate these
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
impacts uh is that sufficient amount or
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
$500,000 uh I don't know if I could
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
answer that question we haven't had
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
anybody apply for that besides that one
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
District um who felt that they you know
 
02:38:03.150 --> 02:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to say because it most
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
people I think would be looking to cover
 
02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
the gap between um what they have to pay
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
for the cap and then what we were able
 
02:38:14.670 --> 02:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
to give them through special education
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
Aid and so right now our cap is right
 
02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:17.950 align:start position:0%
Aid and so right now our cap is right
around

02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
$56,000 and then um and that's only up
 
02:38:22.590 --> 02:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
to three times the amount and then up to
 
02:38:25.630 --> 02:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
10 times the amount um so they could I'm
 
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
thinking per person it might be around
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
$60,000 but it would depend on how many
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
people apply for that fund and because I
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
said we've only had one person ever even
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
consider applying for it I I wouldn't be
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
able to to determine what you would want
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
apologize

02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
have two people with hands
 
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
raised uh see represent is your hand
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
up yes it was just a point of
 
02:39:05.230 --> 02:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
clarification um unincorporated places
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
um don't have local property taxes
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a local
 
02:39:11.389 --> 02:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
government um that's why they're
 
02:39:14.349 --> 02:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
unincorporated so they the county deals
 
02:39:16.349 --> 02:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
with everything for them and the taxes
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
that they pay go to the county that's my
 
02:39:20.910 --> 02:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding as well right
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
right so um you know they they don't
 
02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
have a budget because they don't have a
 
02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
town they don't have anything to budget
 
02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
for so if a child moves into one of to
 
02:39:33.309 --> 02:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
hail's location um that money that
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
they're collecting goes to this County
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
or not to the county as the case may be
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
um and see what I was trying to
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
determine then where I was going with
 
02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
that is that then you have a student
 
02:39:53.230 --> 02:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
move in that is a cat Aid student is the
 
02:39:57.389 --> 02:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
county the one the the the responsible
 
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
agent for paying those
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
costs good question I would I would
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
assume they would be yeah but I've never
 
02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:07.150 align:start position:0%
heard of
 
02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:08.349 align:start position:0%
heard of
[Music]

02:40:08.349 --> 02:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:40:13.950 --> 02:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
it all I know is that U Carol County
 
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and past delegation has
 
02:40:19.630 --> 02:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
voted on a budget for hell's location
 
02:40:23.710 --> 02:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
which is not using County tax
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
funds for that budget there is a
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
separate budget um for um that
 
02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
separate budget um for um that
unincorporated

02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.429 --> 02:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
place that includes all normal items
 
02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
including cost of financial audits Etc
 
02:40:44.349 --> 02:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
anding and that sort of thing right
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative Celli the the county
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
provides the police policing the county
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
provides takes care of the roads
 
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
no uh representative I mean that was my
 
02:40:58.830 --> 02:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of how that works I
 
02:41:01.309 --> 02:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
believe I believe that there is an
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
agreement with the uh sheriff's
 
02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
patrols yeah so so Ju Just on the
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
examples that we've been doing looking
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
at hail location just as an example they
 
02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
act they do actually have a municipal
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
tax rate of
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
$2.98 so they do have Municipal budget I
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
don't think it sounds like they're an
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
unincorporated place um but just above
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
them on the Dr spreadsheet is Hadley's
 
02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
purchase and it's zeros going across the
 
02:41:38.990 --> 02:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
board except for the county tax rate
 
02:41:41.309 --> 02:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
where they pay a flat $2,000 to the
 
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
county for I think exactly what
 
02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
representative Porter was um um you know
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
was talking
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
about H to C if I may represent little
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
hail's location does pay some cost to
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
the town of Conway as representative
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
quelli indicated their primary Police
 
02:42:00.910 --> 02:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
Service is the sheriff but they do use
 
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
Town fire uh and Tom police when
 
02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
necessary and they also they also
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
tuition some of their school some of
 
02:42:11.469 --> 02:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
their students uh to main uh than to New
 
02:42:12.429 --> 02:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I don't know if that
 
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
impacts DRS the other part that is a
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
typically over 55 communi so it has very
 
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
children like on the doe website they've
 
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
got one one student
 
02:42:31.469 --> 02:42:31.479 align:start position:0%
yeah okay represent Porter is your hand
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
still up it is but it should not be okay
 
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
alrighty is there any more discussion on
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill sure Rick yeah so where are you
 
02:42:49.230 --> 02:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
thinking are going with part four well
 
02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:50.670 align:start position:0%
thinking are going with part four well
part

02:42:50.670 --> 02:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:42:53.710 --> 02:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
four it it's dealing directly with
 
02:42:55.870 --> 02:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid you know the formula
 
02:42:57.790 --> 02:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
three and a half times and if we go up
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
through that formula where it's talking
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
about that um quite truthfully I'm
 
02:43:08.230 --> 02:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
intrigued with the The Proposal that's
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
been put together by the department in
 
02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the Actuarial you know the the
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to have these
 
02:43:18.269 --> 02:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
associations where we have insurance
 
02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
pooling of funds to address the cat Aid
 
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
student the special education student
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
that arrives it gives more I guess uh
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
reliability and confidence to the
 
02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
district when they're preparing their
 
02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
budget with a figure based upon that
 
02:43:40.910 --> 02:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
premium cost so um and there has been
 
02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work done with the
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm out in Kansas
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh $100,000 I guess was spent to try and
 
02:43:52.190 --> 02:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
get a calculator and calculations been
 
02:43:55.469 --> 02:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
made for various districts it requires
 
02:43:58.110 --> 02:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
five districts to pull at least a
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
minimum of five districts to pull
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
together and it's an optional optional
 
02:44:09.429 --> 02:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh uh form of of supporting this this
 
02:44:11.389 --> 02:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
real concern we've always addressed cat
 
02:44:15.510 --> 02:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
Aid so I'm intrigued by it and uh I
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
think that there's it's been um since
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
we've last dealt with it further
 
02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
modified I'm very tempted to add that on
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
to because it would be Germaine it deals
 
02:44:30.190 --> 02:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
specifically with this same topic of how
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
we support the special education child
 
02:44:37.469 --> 02:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
that has this really uh uh significant
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
cost so that that's that's where I'm
 
02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
thinking you know that I have been
 
02:44:44.590 --> 02:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about uh placing that right in
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
here and and uh I think it's just about
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
ready to go too so so we're um so we the
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's in there as a separate House Bill
 
02:44:59.230 --> 02:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
what what's happened to that in the
 
02:45:02.030 --> 02:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
Senate I can't give you the just do you
 
02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:04.410 align:start position:0%
know Glen where the status of that bill
 
02:45:04.410 --> 02:45:06.469 align:start position:0%
know Glen where the status of that bill
[Music]

02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
is we can look it up for you right now
 
02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
Dave yeah yeah I I forgot the bill
 
02:45:15.309 --> 02:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
number on that but um but I I guess it
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
was 613 613 right right um I I I would
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
be I would be hesitant to to move that
 
02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
into an Omnibus Bill given that it's
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
already a standalone Bill and will be
 
02:45:32.750 --> 02:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know you know voted on by the Senate
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
um uh but I think the testimony we heard
 
02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to to part four here was
 
02:45:42.670 --> 02:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
that the um the trunch of the the
 
02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
that the um the trunch of the the
existing

02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
250 hasn't been drawn on and um and
 
02:45:51.309 --> 02:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
maybe the current statute is
 
02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient yeah uh 613 did pass the
 
02:45:58.550 --> 02:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
house it went to the Senate uh it's in
 
02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's in house finance it passed house
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
finance no it's in house finance excuse
 
02:46:06.269 --> 02:46:06.279 align:start position:0%
me it's that's where we retained it so
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
it did come to the floor and received a
 
02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
positive vote and was sent to the second
 
02:46:15.389 --> 02:46:15.399 align:start position:0%
committee which is house finance so it
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone to the Senate then no it
 
02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
Finance even though I did not see a
 
02:46:31.230 --> 02:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
it repent bone yeah my my suggestion is
 
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
this since we've heard the the
 
02:46:41.710 --> 02:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
250,000 there hasn't been used so we
 
02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
have money so I think you know for right
 
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
now I mean one of the problems we have
 
02:46:51.190 --> 02:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
with these Omni fields we can't
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
retain so the only thing we can do I
 
02:46:58.750 --> 02:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
think is amend out part four because
 
02:47:01.070 --> 02:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
we're not the money doesn't seem to be
 
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
needed we got the 250,000 there which
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
we' heard isn't being used it'd be nice
 
02:47:09.870 --> 02:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
if it was a separate bill like we do and
 
02:47:11.710 --> 02:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
we could have retained it to do study on
 
02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
it but we can't but we still know my
 
02:47:19.230 --> 02:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
problem too is we've heard all these
 
02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions what about this town what
 
02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
about co-ops what about every Co-op
 
02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
we've known for years every time we deal
 
02:47:29.550 --> 02:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
with Co-op every Co-op agreement is
 
02:47:32.670 --> 02:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
different even area Agreements are
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
different uh so we don't know and you a
 
02:47:38.469 --> 02:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
thousand a few residents like you
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
brought up there are a lot of Rich
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
1,000 resident towns well less
 
02:47:50.110 --> 02:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
so for right now I don't think part four
 
02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:52.469 align:start position:0%
so for right now I don't think part four
is

02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.479 --> 02:47:54.190 align:start position:0%
 
needed

02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:55.750 align:start position:0%
needed
okay

02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know where I'm going on
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
this yet I I'm it came to us when you
 
02:48:04.710 --> 02:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
look at this particular part of the bill
 
02:48:08.429 --> 02:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
part four it came from the Senate and
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
all these bills came out of the Senate
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
either 20 240 or 22-2 or 23 to1 there
 
02:48:18.269 --> 02:48:18.279 align:start position:0%
was pretty much uh a majority of folks
 
02:48:20.190 --> 02:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
on that side voting for each one of
 
02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:21.630 align:start position:0%
on that side voting for each one of
these

02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
pars um so they all are related to
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
education so there there must been some
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a rationale why
 
02:48:33.990 --> 02:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
um this this particular section part
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
four was put in
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
here I I am having a difficult time with
 
02:48:42.429 --> 02:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
it myself
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
so represent woodcock yeah C thank you
 
02:48:48.269 --> 02:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
represent clearly the the the intent
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
already in part four in the RSA gives
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
250,000 that's to school districts
 
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
clearly whoever designated who designed
 
02:48:59.670 --> 02:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
this these three lines their intent was
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
to try to assist small towns versus
 
02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
School District so it's like a it's a
 
02:49:07.150 --> 02:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
whole separate intent clearly but I I do
 
02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
hear um representative bone clearly that
 
02:49:12.269 --> 02:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
they have 250,000 not using now which
 
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
they could apply for but this this is
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
specific to towns versus districts
 
02:49:18.190 --> 02:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
difference thank you yep you're
 
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
welcome further discussion on this bill
 
02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:32.110 --> 02:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
147 okay when we when we come to meet
 
02:49:34.510 --> 02:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
next uh
 
02:49:37.630 --> 02:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
Thursday uh we're going to have to have
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
one Amendment for the entire
 
02:49:44.110 --> 02:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
Bill uh we can't be just amending
 
02:49:45.429 --> 02:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
amending amending because then they're
 
02:49:47.070 --> 02:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
going to you know that's not how it
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
works on Omnibus bills we need to have
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh closure on all four sections so
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to be done um M
 
02:50:02.229 --> 02:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
have you had any discussion with your
 
02:50:05.190 --> 02:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
this no we were basically waiting for
 
02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
the work session we've talked about it
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
but uh needed to have the work session
 
02:50:15.710 --> 02:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
to see where we were on that David
 
02:50:18.269 --> 02:50:18.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so along those along those same
 
02:50:21.630 --> 02:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
lines Rick um I know this is an Omnibus
 
02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
Bill but it's just a bill um and and and
 
02:50:29.550 --> 02:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
and even any one bill can be subject to
 
02:50:31.469 --> 02:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments at the committee
 
02:50:34.750 --> 02:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
level and then those amendments get um
 
02:50:36.910 --> 02:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
squished together and turned into a
 
02:50:38.670 --> 02:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
committee amendment I mean isn't that
 
02:50:41.790 --> 02:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:43.429 align:start position:0%
 
works

02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:50:45.229 --> 02:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I I I know that can
 
02:50:51.190 --> 02:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
occur you know if we're going to come
 
02:50:55.229 --> 02:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
forward with numerous amendments for all
 
02:50:55.239 --> 02:50:56.070 align:start position:0%
forward with numerous amendments for all
these

02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:50:59.389 --> 02:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
bills uh we're g to be look and if we're
 
02:51:03.070 --> 02:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to take a action on by the end of
 
02:51:05.389 --> 02:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
Thursday next we're going to have to
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
have that amendment number and so we're
 
02:51:10.910 --> 02:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to then trip across to
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislative services and try to mesh
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
everything together I don't know given
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
the nature of some of the Committees
 
02:51:22.830 --> 02:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
have bills that have 15 or so uh parts
 
02:51:25.349 --> 02:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
to them which uh they're in the process
 
02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
of trying to put together too I don't
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
know if LSR could uh absorb all this as
 
02:51:33.070 --> 02:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
we get close to the the final date here
 
02:51:35.229 --> 02:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
right but if we if we bring if we bring
 
02:51:38.309 --> 02:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
in a single Amendment people might have
 
02:51:40.030 --> 02:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
different feelings over I mean it's sort
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
of like an all or nothing I mean I think
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
um you know someone might might think
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
that look let's amend out section four I
 
02:51:50.309 --> 02:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
mean well that's exactly that's exactly
 
02:51:53.710 --> 02:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
what this we've got anous
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
bill that's the nature of the Beast yeah
 
02:51:58.269 --> 02:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
so someone might might agree with
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
amending out section four but not agree
 
02:52:04.349 --> 02:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
with amending out section one and we're
 
02:52:06.229 --> 02:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
all gonna experience that with hb2
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
aren't we right right right right but I
 
02:52:10.429 --> 02:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
mean there could be an amendment that
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
just deletes section one and there could
 
02:52:16.349 --> 02:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
be another amendment that talks about
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
the changes in the coach transport um um
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
thing you know what what what Alicia and
 
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
and Steve are working on and there could
 
02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
be a third amendment that amends out
 
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
section four um and people might vote
 
02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
differently on those three amendments
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately what passes as an
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
amendment gets combined into a single
 
02:52:41.389 --> 02:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment and I think that
 
02:52:45.229 --> 02:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
happens that sort of happens you know
 
02:52:47.469 --> 02:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
maybe Jen can explain how that happens I
 
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't hey Jen are you hanging around I
 
02:52:55.229 --> 02:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
am okay are have you been listening this
 
02:52:58.030 --> 02:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
the latter part of the discussion here
 
02:53:01.790 --> 02:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um and it's really um the
 
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee's prerogative you can bring in
 
02:53:05.550 --> 02:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment that amends multiple
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
sections or you could go and kind of
 
02:53:11.630 --> 02:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
treat it more like each part is its own
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
bill which you know it sort of
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
is in our minds at least um and do it
 
02:53:23.790 --> 02:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
like representative luno described um
 
02:53:27.429 --> 02:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
that is what we did in judiciary um yeah
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
I understand that Jen um when Judiciary
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
had all the separate amendments done how
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
did they arrive at the final action did
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
they have a a combined amendment of all
 
02:53:45.150 --> 02:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
those amendments and in the one and then
 
02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
bill yes um what they did is they voted
 
02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
they went through all the proposed
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
amendments the Amendments that
 
02:54:02.110 --> 02:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
passed came into one motion at the end
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
so it would be UT to pass with
 
02:54:07.710 --> 02:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
amendments a b and c and that's the
 
02:54:10.269 --> 02:54:10.279 align:start position:0%
package that had to be voted on
 
02:54:13.630 --> 02:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately um and then we combined and
 
02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:15.870 align:start position:0%
ultimately um and then we combined and
um

02:54:15.870 --> 02:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
got the committee amendment that
 
02:54:21.150 --> 02:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
combined those ABC D so you made a a a
 
02:54:23.630 --> 02:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
motion to approve a b and
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
c uh and then your final after you've
 
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
done all those amendments you made those
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
motions to part one a and whatever then
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of when you're done was there
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
a motion to ought pass or ought to pass
 
02:54:41.469 --> 02:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
such and such
 
02:54:46.670 --> 02:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill with a and C or was ab and C
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.110 --> 02:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
D in this instance that I'm describing
 
02:54:56.110 --> 02:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
they adopted all of the Amendments and
 
02:54:59.590 --> 02:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
we um requested a Consolidated Amendment
 
02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
after the
 
02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
fact I think it's ideal to get the
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Amendment ahead of time if
 
02:55:09.309 --> 02:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
you have the luxury of doing that but I
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
know it would take a long time to wait
 
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
so you can do it either way so so it's
 
02:55:21.630 --> 02:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
it's an accepted process then to move
 
02:55:24.150 --> 02:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
separate amendments and then make a
 
02:55:30.030 --> 02:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
final motion to um amend the bill ought
 
02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:33.010 align:start position:0%
to pass with
 
02:55:33.010 --> 02:55:34.349 align:start position:0%
to pass with
[Music]

02:55:34.349 --> 02:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
ABC yes Pro provided that those
 
02:55:41.550 --> 02:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
amendments are all
 
02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
um um compatible and combined into one
 
02:55:48.229 --> 02:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment does legislative Services then
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
take a b and c and make them D yes
 
02:55:54.229 --> 02:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
because in the calendar and on the floor
 
02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
you'll need just the one amendment
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
number so we would contact exactly
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's exactly how I see it good
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you Jen
 
02:56:06.229 --> 02:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I guess we have the option of
 
02:56:10.190 --> 02:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
doing that way as well Dave
 
02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I I I think honestly think
 
02:56:17.950 --> 02:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
on some of these bills there may be um
 
02:56:20.830 --> 02:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
amendments that that you know different
 
02:56:22.269 --> 02:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
people are going to feel different ways
 
02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
about so so I think this is the um I I
 
02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a good way uh forward and
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about it on a uh you
 
02:56:34.670 --> 02:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
know Partyline basis but but even on a
 
02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
on on a bipartisan basis uh people could
 
02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
feel different ways about different
 
02:56:44.349 --> 02:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
things and um and certainly um um you
 
02:56:46.269 --> 02:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
know we feel there may be there may be
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
amendments that that we want to offer
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
during the exec um that might not have
 
02:56:58.469 --> 02:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
made their way into a an upfront a you
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
know a committee amendment that was done
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
um prior to the exec session so so so
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
just to just to
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
clarify using your example Rick where
 
02:57:12.349 --> 02:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
you have Amendment a b and
 
02:57:15.630 --> 02:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
c on this particular ular omous Bill
 
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
once those amendments a B and C are
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
passed then does the uh then does
 
02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
the legislative Services have to come
 
02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
back with a A Renewed omnus bill or do
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
the what they're going to do is they're
 
02:57:38.229 --> 02:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
going to we're GNA make a motion to
 
02:57:43.030 --> 02:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
approve 147 for example and we have uh
 
02:57:47.710 --> 02:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
three uh as amended with might be only a
 
02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:48.630 align:start position:0%
three uh as amended with might be only a
and

02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:51.550 --> 02:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
C or it could be a b and c or a B
 
02:57:55.309 --> 02:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
whatever and then we make that motion
 
02:57:59.550 --> 02:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
and it would also then what I understand
 
02:58:02.750 --> 02:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the when it gets legislative
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
Services they be combining a b and c
 
02:58:11.070 --> 02:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the ones we approved into one
 
02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:12.510 align:start position:0%
whatever the ones we approved into one
Amendment

02:58:12.510 --> 02:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:58:16.950 --> 02:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
for one 47 so and then the house will

move on to 148 and
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
135 um we also have S sp19 we have to
 
02:59:16.550 --> 02:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
address um s sp19 was the Signum
 
02:59:18.750 --> 02:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill and I don't know we haven't have
 
02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
you did do
 
02:59:23.790 --> 02:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
44 yes that you did okay
 
02:59:27.229 --> 02:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
so we that was one when we did with with
 
02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh the two previous bills at the very
 
02:59:34.110 --> 02:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
beginning it was 20 and 24 I believe and
 
02:59:38.070 --> 02:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
19 um and we passed two of those out the
 
02:59:41.070 --> 02:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
pass but we we were in a mode I was in
 
02:59:43.630 --> 02:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
the mode to retain 19 at that time since
 
02:59:43.640 --> 02:59:44.750 align:start position:0%
the mode to retain 19 at that time since
then

02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:59:47.469 --> 02:59:47.479 align:start position:0%

Senate it's not been passed by the
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
Senate's an enrolled bill right now so s
 
02:59:58.510 --> 02:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
sp19 we it could be taken care of very
 
02:59:58.520 --> 03:00:01.309 align:start position:0%
sp19 we it could be taken care of very
quickly

03:00:01.309 --> 03:00:01.319 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
all hey Mel the way you fix your putting
 
04:00:49.750 --> 04:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
is have the pencil with a big eraser
 
04:00:51.429 --> 04:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's true you go back to you go back
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
to the scorecard that's true my yard is
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
starting to look like Chucksters I have
 
04:01:02.950 --> 04:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
a I have a putting mat out there I have
 
04:01:06.750 --> 04:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
a chunk of astro turf that I can chip my
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
foam balls off of uh so I I'm thinking
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
about charging an admission
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
fee you're really getting into this
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
thing s that's is good this is what the
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic has done to me I cannot wait to
 
04:01:25.149 --> 04:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
be outside always well you know what I
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
do is you know as you know I walk the
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
golf course I don't ride in the golf
 
04:01:32.110 --> 04:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
cart except unless I've got a guess but
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know I'm always reminded of will
 
04:01:37.469 --> 04:01:37.479 align:start position:0%
rogers's quote that golf is a good walk
 
04:01:37.479 --> 04:01:39.429 align:start position:0%
rogers's quote that golf is a good walk
spoiled

04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%

04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
kidding but I view golf it's kind of
 
04:01:47.469 --> 04:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
like it's instead of going to the gym I
 
04:01:50.429 --> 04:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
go walking so that's what I do
 
04:01:52.990 --> 04:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
exactly you make several stops along the
 
04:01:55.630 --> 04:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
way in your walk Bel yeah yeah exactly
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
well you know if if you walk 18 holes
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
you figure it's about five miles right
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%

representa um one of the pleasures that
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
I've had Being A legislature legislator

Commission on deafness and hearing us
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and so when I and
 
04:06:13.950 --> 04:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
my co-chair was D Clanton who is in
 
04:06:16.149 --> 04:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
charge of
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
um this the locational Rehabilitation um
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
section of the doe he's also a member of
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
the de Community um and I know that that
 
04:06:28.349 --> 04:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
Community is really underserved um the
 
04:06:30.389 --> 04:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
state compared to other states doesn't
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
do for its de citizens what other states
 
04:06:37.149 --> 04:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
do so when I was looking over this bill
 
04:06:39.670 --> 04:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
before we met this morning and I saw
 
04:06:41.910 --> 04:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
that there was a section repealed and I
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
saw that the first section was RSA 200
 
04:06:48.269 --> 04:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
C7 which had to do with telec
 
04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
communication equipment I looked up the
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
section and sure enough it has to do
 
04:06:54.429 --> 04:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
with with um assistant in
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and other assistance
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
to people who are DEA are heart of
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and I was concerned I don't know
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
enough about I wasn't here for your
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
hearing so I don't know what was um
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
discussed but I was just wondering if
 
04:07:10.269 --> 04:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
had been anybody here from that
 
04:07:12.910 --> 04:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
commission to talk about this deletion
 
04:07:16.189 --> 04:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
or if that commission had been um
 
04:07:19.950 --> 04:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
consulted at all with this um repeal
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:07:23.950 --> 04:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
repeal uh represent Porter I also went
 
04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
and looked up all these sections and I
 
04:07:28.030 --> 04:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
saw the same thing and it it really has
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of impact in the classroom uh so
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh do we have anybody uh Deb that's uh
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%

04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%

still sometimes when you promote someone
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%

148 we're seeing in the first area
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's been deleted uh relative to
 
04:09:07.870 --> 04:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment and that
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
right in the classroom um we want we'd
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
like to know why that's being deleted if
 
04:09:16.269 --> 04:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
it's being placed elsewhere that's fine
 
04:09:16.279 --> 04:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
it's being placed elsewhere that's fine
but

04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
um we we just uh need further
 
04:09:23.109 --> 04:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
clarification so if you give me just a
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%

rehab okay hopefully answer some of
 
04:09:28.680 --> 04:09:30.309 align:start position:0%
rehab okay hopefully answer some of
those

04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions I do you know that put back in
 
04:09:33.840 --> 04:09:35.349 align:start position:0%
questions I do you know that put back in
under

04:09:35.349 --> 04:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
um under Roman numeral
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
two it says procedures for the purchase
 
04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair of special
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
Communications equipment I'm not sure
 
04:09:48.990 --> 04:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
why they rearranged it like they did
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
but well from what I the way I read it
 
04:09:54.990 --> 04:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like these Provisions are taken
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
out of Law and and given the authority
 
04:10:01.710 --> 04:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
to uh for these sections is given to Ru
 
04:10:05.070 --> 04:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
making in the doe so it's taking away
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
from uh us the ability to regulate these
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
things and giving it to the department
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
and so that would if I'm reading what
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
you said representative leus
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
correctly um that's
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
where section lines 14 and through 19
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
come in on page two right I'm just not
 
04:10:29.109 --> 04:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
sure why they did
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
that I tried to reach representative
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
Pearson who is now the current chair of
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
that commission um but I haven't been
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%

if she'll be able to hop on immediately
 
04:10:56.109 --> 04:10:56.119 align:start position:0%

04:13:31.710 --> 04:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
equipment that's the first part that's
 
04:13:34.830 --> 04:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
been deleted yeah yeah um thank you for
 
04:13:36.510 --> 04:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
the question representative lad and for
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
the committee uh so this uh
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
interestingly when our um when our
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
statute had been updated in the past
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
this was moved to the governor's
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability this particular
 
04:13:51.710 --> 04:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
program um the Telecommunications
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
program and it actually has its own set
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
of administrative rules with the
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on disability um
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
so it was just not eliminated from our
 
04:14:05.790 --> 04:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.670 --> 04:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
moved okay where was that statute moved
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
to then um I let me just look in my
 
04:14:15.710 --> 04:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
email I may have a
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
reference um if I can't find the
 
04:14:21.910 --> 04:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
reference immediately I will certainly
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
um ask Chuck uh seya for that um find it
 
04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:14:31.149 --> 04:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
guys let me just see if I might have it
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.080 --> 04:14:40.109 align:start position:0%
 
hand

04:14:40.109 --> 04:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.950 --> 04:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing it real quick but I I
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
will be able to get it for you um fairly
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
shortly representative lad okay then in
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
looking at underneath that particular
 
04:14:54.109 --> 04:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
statute there's number of other areas uh
 
04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
within that same uh section of Law
 
04:14:58.830 --> 04:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
chapter of law that are also being
 
04:15:01.229 --> 04:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
deleted are they all going to another
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
location under the governor's
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
commission no so the um personal
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
services care worker program um we're
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
not actually sure where that landed um
 
04:15:16.109 --> 04:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
it it as long as I've been around which
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
is about 18 years um that has not been a
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
part of our current program and we
 
04:15:25.710 --> 04:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
reached out to um the governor's
 
04:15:28.030 --> 04:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
commission as well as health and human
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
services department and they had no
 
04:15:34.630 --> 04:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
record of it either so this um I'm not
 
04:15:37.229 --> 04:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
sure how how to address that and I
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
actually we talked about that um you
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
know when we were preparing this is you
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
know should that question come up it's
 
04:15:47.550 --> 04:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's tough because it just seemed to
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
uis is Art got his stand up somewhere
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%

connect with you I I I have a sort of a
 
04:16:15.309 --> 04:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
similar uh question about uh c1113 which
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
is repealing it's this says relative to
 
04:16:21.870 --> 04:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
insufficient funds I guess I my question
 
04:16:25.590 --> 04:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
is what is the impact of that on and
 
04:16:27.790 --> 04:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
where you know yeah what's the impact of
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
repealing that going to be on the
 
04:16:33.469 --> 04:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
program okay let me um just bring up the
 
04:16:35.790 --> 04:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
language I apologize that I was not on
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
the committee meeting to address these
 
04:16:38.279 --> 04:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
the committee meeting to address these
issues

04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:16:46.450 --> 04:16:46.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.460 --> 04:16:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
away okay there's only one Senator
 
04:16:52.910 --> 04:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's a prime sponsor on this bill too
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
that Senator Ward so obviously it's
 
04:16:57.670 --> 04:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
something that came over from
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
doe as yeah or something such as that
 
04:17:01.319 --> 04:17:02.510 align:start position:0%
doe as yeah or something such as that
representative

04:17:02.510 --> 04:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you Mr chair I did just get
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
a phone call from repr resentative
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
Pearson he knew nothing about this
 
04:17:11.389 --> 04:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
change um this is the first that he
 
04:17:14.710 --> 04:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
heard of it um so I'm just concerned I
 
04:17:14.720 --> 04:17:16.389 align:start position:0%
heard of it um so I'm just concerned I
don't

04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
know why if it was put in and was
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
covered under the um commission for
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
disab Disabilities why the uh Commission
 
04:17:26.590 --> 04:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
on Defence and hearing loss wouldn't
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
have been aware of that number one and
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
number two why then the Department of
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
Education still has rulemaking authority
 
04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
over eligibility for um equipment
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
or deaf and heart of hearing
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
people it I'm I'm just feeling very
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.389 --> 04:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
this I think a number of us have
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions regarding what's going on here
 
04:17:55.349 --> 04:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
represent likeus yeah going through this
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to follow the take this
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
out put this in and whatever it looks
 
04:18:03.309 --> 04:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
like the only real change that's
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
happened is that they got rid of the
 
04:18:07.790 --> 04:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
procedures for dis urement of monies
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
from the program established under RSA
 
04:18:10.199 --> 04:18:11.309 align:start position:0%
from the program established under RSA
200

04:18:11.309 --> 04:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
200
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
C7 and that it took changed in and the
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
it had had one two and three and they
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
redid it so it now has one and two and
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
one and two were the old two and
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.720 --> 04:18:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
result

04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
result
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh is there somebody still there from
 
04:18:39.680 --> 04:18:44.309 align:start position:0%
uh is there somebody still there from
the

04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
Department yeah I'm I'm still here
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
representative um obviously this
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee has some concerns on this
 
04:18:55.469 --> 04:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
we've heard the bill uh I don't know if
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
I heard at that time specific rationale
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
for some of the deletion of these these
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
items here are moving
 
04:19:06.109 --> 04:19:06.119 align:start position:0%
around um what we'll need to have is
 
04:19:06.119 --> 04:19:07.149 align:start position:0%
around um what we'll need to have is
that

04:19:07.149 --> 04:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:08.910 --> 04:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know without some good
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
reasoning I think it's going to be very
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to go anywhere with this bill
 
04:19:16.109 --> 04:19:16.119 align:start position:0%
um unless we get something back from doe
 
04:19:18.070 --> 04:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
saying it's clean up and it's over here
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
or there or it's being handled by not
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
the commission for disability somebody
 
04:19:26.429 --> 04:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
else what whatever might be going on um
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
but I I feel like a little bit in the
 
04:19:28.680 --> 04:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
but I I feel like a little bit in the
dark

04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
dark
 
04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
here I understand representative lad and
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
I will um work on specific um rationale
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%

04:21:07.159 --> 04:21:08.590 align:start position:0%
me to go through these areas first yes
okay

04:21:08.590 --> 04:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
um Jo going down uh uh let's see I let
 
04:21:27.790 --> 04:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:32.189 --> 04:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
there okay um I in on the first part of
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I really don't have
 
04:21:38.670 --> 04:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
anything beyond on what they have in
 
04:21:41.830 --> 04:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
terms of expansion or replacement that
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's all fine um I do though have uh
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
under let's see number three I'm dealing
 
04:21:58.349 --> 04:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a place where it says cerent
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
technical education
 
04:22:04.830 --> 04:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
consistent of consistent quality shall
 
04:22:06.429 --> 04:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
be equally available to students of
 
04:22:11.469 --> 04:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
across the state um where is that
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
um page three number two May number two
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
number three I'm sorry number
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
three that's a transportation cost that'
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
be the next area but I just have a
 
04:22:27.870 --> 04:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
sentence in working with Eric farth
 
04:22:29.950 --> 04:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
where I add in New Hampshire students
 
04:22:32.309 --> 04:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
are incouraged to access Career and
 
04:22:35.149 --> 04:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
Technical education to learn and apply
 
04:22:38.070 --> 04:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
technical academ mic and employability
 
04:22:40.590 --> 04:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
skills needed for career and life that
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
was just an opening prefix just before
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
we get to the section says Career and
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
Technical education
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation this is an area which has
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
some major changes in
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
it I'm going to read it to you as I have
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
right here so go to the section of Bill
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
that deals with
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation can everybody find
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
that I think that's on page three
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:08.510 align:start position:0%
that I think that's on page three
1888

04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so what it starts off the
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is authorized to
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
reimburse okay I'll read that sentence
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education is
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
authorized to reimburse from its regular
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
budget the full cost fulls in the Bill
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
of transportation and working with um
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
Dave Waters um subject to availability
 
04:23:32.960 --> 04:23:33.670 align:start position:0%
Dave Waters um subject to availability
of

04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
funding has been added in for a regional
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education students
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
who attend Regional Career and Technical
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
Education Centers and for B at RIS
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
students who attend alternative
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
education programs located at Regional
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical Education Center or
 
04:23:53.309 --> 04:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
other Comprehensive High School
 
04:23:55.790 --> 04:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
transportation cost shall not exceed the
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
rate adopted pursuant to RSA 541a by the
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
state board next sentence there are some
 
04:24:04.389 --> 04:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
changes here instead of the sending
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
District it's the students resident
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
District the students resident District
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
we're getting at the issue of NASA exor
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
and Manchester the students resident
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
District shall be responsible for
 
04:24:19.080 --> 04:24:20.590 align:start position:0%
District shall be responsible for
providing

04:24:20.590 --> 04:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
providing
 
04:24:22.710 --> 04:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
transportation and paying the
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
transportation costs and shall then be
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursed from State
 
04:24:32.830 --> 04:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
funds then a new sentence is added
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
here if a student is permitted to self
 
04:24:40.189 --> 04:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
transport the students resident District
 
04:24:43.030 --> 04:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
shall shall reimburse the student in
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
accordance with rules adopted pursuant
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
to RSA
 
04:24:49.229 --> 04:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
541a and shall then be reimbursed from
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
State funds what that sentence does it
 
04:24:55.710 --> 04:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
takes what's in education rule already
 
04:24:57.790 --> 04:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
and that's happening in high schools
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
where you may have one or two kids who
 
04:25:01.710 --> 04:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
want to go to the CTE Center in the
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon rather than taking a bus they
 
04:25:07.229 --> 04:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
may drive their own vehicle
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
if they're going to a location which is
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
not in the same high school that they
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
are you know a resident
 
04:25:16.269 --> 04:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
student the state reimburses those kids
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
right now 25 cents per uh per mile it
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
goes to the school then to the through
 
04:25:26.109 --> 04:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
the individual that's in rule right now
 
04:25:29.309 --> 04:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
but the rule in law right now doesn't
 
04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
have any statutory reference and so what
 
04:25:35.149 --> 04:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is get statutory
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
reference some kids are going to the CTE
 
04:25:40.590 --> 04:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
Center not going and for example I'll
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
use mine for example it's in Bradford
 
04:25:45.309 --> 04:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
Vermont after they finish school at 3
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock or 3:30 they can and go to on
 
04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
the job of apprentice ship type programs
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
right there in Bradford they don't go
 
04:25:58.349 --> 04:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
home they go home by way of their own
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle rather than having a bus come
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
pick them up at a separate time when all
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
the buses go out this is being done
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
throughout uh the
 
04:26:10.349 --> 04:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
state so what we're trying to do is
 
04:26:13.149 --> 04:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
account for how we can provide
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
transportation services in Manchester or
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
exor or nashwa where the center is on
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
the oppos opposite side of the city but
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
the kids still have to be transported in
 
04:26:26.349 --> 04:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
a safe manner the school district gets
 
04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
no Transportation reimbursement right
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
now for that because they're not the
 
04:26:33.870 --> 04:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
sending District they're the resident
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
District so this would allow all
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
districts to be supported with this now
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
the cost this is somebody's going to say
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
what about the cost for this right now
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
we spend the the amount of money which
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
school districts re um uh reimbursed for
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
transportation services back in 2020 was
 
04:26:54.239 --> 04:26:55.790 align:start position:0%
transportation services back in 2020 was
$680,000

04:26:55.790 --> 04:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
$680,000
 
04:27:00.590 --> 04:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
for the state the actual cost for
 
04:27:02.429 --> 04:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
transportation was
 
04:27:02.439 --> 04:27:04.189 align:start position:0%
transportation was
$2.6

04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
$2.6
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
Million so we're basically $2 million
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
short on on even paying the actual costs
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
right now what this bill would do it
 
04:27:17.269 --> 04:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
would put into print in the statute
 
04:27:20.070 --> 04:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
saying that all are going to be
 
04:27:22.710 --> 04:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
receiving this money not depends upon
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
what is put in the budget by Finance I
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
know there's an effort right now to
 
04:27:31.109 --> 04:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
consider on the Senate side additional
 
04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
dollars that they can find that Revenue
 
04:27:36.269 --> 04:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
to support transportation of kids to CTE
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking for that $2
 
04:27:43.550 --> 04:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
million so that takes through that that
 
04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes so I just want to be clear in my
 
04:27:48.990 --> 04:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
head Manchester will start now getting
 
04:27:51.790 --> 04:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursed like transporting students
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
from West High School to the School of
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
Technology and back it would be so it
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
based upon the effective date of this
 
04:28:02.590 --> 04:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation okay yeah thank
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
you and the the career techn education
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
directors when we tried to do this when
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
I was on the advisory Council for CTE
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
they were not supportive of it simply
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
because we're taking that P of pot of
 
04:28:21.429 --> 04:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.710 --> 04:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
students so
 
04:28:28.109 --> 04:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
um any questions on on on that principle
 
04:28:30.670 --> 04:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
or so you have that you have that
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
language written Rick that you could
 
04:28:34.950 --> 04:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
send it to us so we could look at it yes
 
04:28:36.670 --> 04:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
I will in fact for this part of the bill
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
I'll send it all to you because I've
 
04:28:40.670 --> 04:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
gone through all this with uh Eric
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
forworth at the department and gone
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
through it with the Senators that put
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
forth this
 
04:28:50.670 --> 04:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
legislation they I I do have a I do have
 
04:28:52.590 --> 04:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
a question at the at the beginning it's
 
04:28:56.670 --> 04:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
more a procedural question the uh under
 
04:28:56.680 --> 04:28:58.750 align:start position:0%
more a procedural question the uh under
part

04:28:58.750 --> 04:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
part
 
04:29:01.950 --> 04:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
21b where it talks about private schools
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
and homeschool
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
students the the question that I have is
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
that let's say I have a u uh a student
 
04:29:15.389 --> 04:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
from hopkington who is going to Proctor
 
04:29:18.429 --> 04:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
Academy and is a resident student at
 
04:29:18.439 --> 04:29:19.950 align:start position:0%
Academy and is a resident student at
Proctor

04:29:19.950 --> 04:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
Proctor
 
04:29:22.990 --> 04:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
Academy but wants to take a part of a
 
04:29:26.349 --> 04:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
CTE program at conquered High School
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
transportation for that student come
 
04:29:33.309 --> 04:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
from I'm I'm
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
assuming that the trans Transportation
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
will come from Hopkinton High
 
04:29:41.790 --> 04:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
School not from Proctor
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
Academy to get that student to the CTE
 
04:29:49.229 --> 04:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
program am I correct in that I'm just
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
again it's a proceed I'm not I'm not
 
04:29:55.109 --> 04:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
debating the merits of stud of a private
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
school or home school I'm really
 
04:29:59.469 --> 04:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about making sure that that
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
the school district doesn't have to
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
change their transportation system
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
to get students from the resident High
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
School to the CTE program am I correct
 
04:30:14.189 --> 04:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
in assuming
 
04:30:19.710 --> 04:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't assume anything now um I
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
I for example just take it I'm assuming
 
04:30:25.469 --> 04:30:25.479 align:start position:0%
that the homeschool
 
04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
student still has to come to the high
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
school and not be picked up at their
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
home to be taken to the CTA CTE Center
 
04:30:37.630 --> 04:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
other's I I think that's fair to say yes
 
04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
because I I I don't want the school
 
04:30:42.750 --> 04:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
district to have to set up special
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
programs for students who may not be in
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
that high school as they go from the
 
04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
high school to the CTE Center or as as
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
Glenn just mentioned they could self
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
transport they could do that they could
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think what we need to do is uh
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
on the private school transportation I
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
we need to call Dave Waters or Eric far
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
worth is he is Eric on the the line here
 
04:31:08.279 --> 04:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
worth is he is Eric on the the line here
on

04:31:09.510 --> 04:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
attendee is anybody from the Department
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
appas yes I'm gonna reach out to Eric
 
04:31:28.590 --> 04:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
right now to have him join okay so if we
 
04:31:32.550 --> 04:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:39.429 --> 04:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
would you like me to
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
remove no leave Nat on we'll get Eric
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
too here he is there he is are you there

too here he is there he is are you there
Eric

04:31:50.950 --> 04:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
Eric
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
y good afternoon I decided to listen in
 
04:31:56.590 --> 04:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
and as I listened in it said hey we need
 
04:31:57.990 --> 04:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
to go find
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
Eric exactly right Eric um in the we're
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
part two of the SB 148 right now dealing
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
with Career Technical education the
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
changes we've worked on um we have if a
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
student attends a charter public school
 
04:32:15.469 --> 04:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
private school or is homeschooled
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
transportation for the private school
 
04:32:20.910 --> 04:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
kid uh what happens if they're like the
 
04:32:23.309 --> 04:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
example is given by representa Myer at
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
Proctor Academy and they um want to go
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
elsewhere to conquered Regional or
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
conquered CTE Center who pays for the uh
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
the transportation is it the the the
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
academy or is it hopkington or who so
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
historically um from our understanding
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
the private schools or the charter
 
04:32:46.269 --> 04:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
schools have always provided
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
transportation for the kids who've
 
04:32:52.269 --> 04:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
attended CTE centers uh if the the
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
students are able to get to their
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
traditional sending High School the
 
04:32:59.229 --> 04:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
public high school in time to catch the
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
bus they could do it in that way if the
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
Student Self
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
transports can work with their home
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
school district for the reimbursement of
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
the 25 cents per mile but it would be
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
calculated from the public high school
 
04:33:17.949 --> 04:33:17.959 align:start position:0%
to the CTE Center not from whatever
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
charter school or uh private school
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
they're attending um so there's there's
 
04:33:25.470 --> 04:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
really never been anything C you know
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
really clearly written about it um and I
 
04:33:29.629 --> 04:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
would imagine because so few students
 
04:33:32.109 --> 04:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
have ever participated from those groups
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to recruit more from
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
those groups right yeah
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah Eric Eric is representing Myer
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
my only my my concern is I have no
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
problem with the private school or hes
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
school students going there I just want
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that special
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
Arrangements don't have to be made by
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the school district to either pick up a
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
homeschooler at home right or a private
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
school in this instance at Proctor
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
Academy uh that would be an additional
 
04:34:10.109 --> 04:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
burden on the school district as far as
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
Transportation goes that's that's that
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
was my concern no understood and and the
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
way uh the transportation reimbursement
 
04:34:20.029 --> 04:34:20.039 align:start position:0%
rules are written the state reimburses
 
04:34:21.750 --> 04:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
the school districts for transportation
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
from the home High School to the CTE
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
Center and it doesn't allow for sort of
 
04:34:30.429 --> 04:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
roundabout stops thank you very much
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
sure rules any other we have more
 
04:34:36.510 --> 04:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
questions for you Eric don't go I'm not
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
going anywhere I represent Porter thank
 
04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and this is again another
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
ignorant question because I don't know
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
you feeled very well under the current
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
law or under this bill as it stands who
 
04:34:52.510 --> 04:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
pays the tuition to the um Career and
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
Technical education center for the
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
private school student or the home
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
school student or the charter school
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
student there it it would it's a great
 
04:35:06.429 --> 04:35:06.439 align:start position:0%
question and not an ignorant one at all
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
very few people know the answer to this
 
04:35:11.869 --> 04:35:11.879 align:start position:0%
uh the state pays up to 75% of the
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
tuition and the student resident
 
04:35:14.959 --> 04:35:16.590 align:start position:0%
tuition and the student resident
homeschool

04:35:16.590 --> 04:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
homeschool
 
04:35:21.070 --> 04:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
District pays the remaining 25% plus uh
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
so regardless of where their private
 
04:35:25.629 --> 04:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
school is or Charter School is if they
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
physically live in Bow and they attend
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
the CTE Center then the city of the B
 
04:35:33.869 --> 04:35:33.879 align:start position:0%
school district will receive that
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
bill 20 25% 25% Eric Eric could you go
 
04:35:40.750 --> 04:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
through that please I don't think many
 
04:35:43.230 --> 04:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
people understand the 7525 and that
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation coming out
 
04:35:49.349 --> 04:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
first yeah uh so uh currently there is
 
04:35:51.789 --> 04:35:51.799 align:start position:0%
$9 million set aside in the education
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh for tuition and
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
transportation for CTE
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh and through the through
 
04:36:03.390 --> 04:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
the rules the to the transportation
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
portion is paid first and right now that
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
is reimbursed at 10 cents per mile per
 
04:36:12.429 --> 04:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
kid if it is done on a public school bus
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
or 25 cents per mile if the student is
 
04:36:18.789 --> 04:36:18.799 align:start position:0%
given permission to self transport uh as
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
part of this legislation we are actually
 
04:36:22.590 --> 04:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
asking for that transportation to be
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
changed to actual cost for the school
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
district because they are losing uh
 
04:36:32.349 --> 04:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
upwards of 1.5 million in transportation
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
costs uh regardless whichever way this
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
happens once the transportation is paid
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
for there is a pot of money left to
 
04:36:39.600 --> 04:36:41.109 align:start position:0%
for there is a pot of money left to
cover

04:36:41.109 --> 04:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
cover
 
04:36:44.709 --> 04:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
tuition uh it is then uh we take the
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
number of students that are from sending
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
school districts divided into that pot
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
of money and that determines how much
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement cost is per student
 
04:36:56.910 --> 04:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
and that is what is sent to the CTE
 
04:36:58.510 --> 04:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
center for the number of students that
 
04:37:02.830 --> 04:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
are on um uh some from sending
 
04:37:06.990 --> 04:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
schools uh and the it is up to 75%
 
04:37:08.910 --> 04:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's always the goal uh we never quite
 
04:37:11.629 --> 04:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
make it there uh but initially a school
 
04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
district will receive a bill for 25% of
 
04:37:16.590 --> 04:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
the tuition and then once all of the
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
state funds are expended if that didn't
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
cover the
 
04:37:23.709 --> 04:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
75% the sending school districts will
 
04:37:25.869 --> 04:37:25.879 align:start position:0%
receive a supplemental Bill to cover
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
difference any questions on that folks
 
04:37:34.109 --> 04:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
the transportation I mentioned earlier
 
04:37:35.949 --> 04:37:35.959 align:start position:0%
to them I took the figures she gave us
 
04:37:35.959 --> 04:37:36.949 align:start position:0%
to them I took the figures she gave us
from

04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
2020 where the the actual the reimbursed
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
amount was $680,000
 
04:37:47.429 --> 04:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
and the actual cost was much more it was
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
almost $2 million more yeah 2.6 is what
 
04:37:53.789 --> 04:37:53.799 align:start position:0%
I said um so there is a huge difference
 
04:37:56.789 --> 04:37:56.799 align:start position:0%
there of about a couple million dollars
 
04:37:59.789 --> 04:37:59.799 align:start position:0%
now if we expand this to include exitor
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
NASA and
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
Manchester um we're going to either have
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
to put put more bucks into that in that
 
04:38:10.269 --> 04:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
that you know the 9 million or else
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
districts are going to get less money
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
for transport you know for the whole
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be spread out more ways
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
correct and I agree and
 
04:38:22.990 --> 04:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh the so the transportation was short
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
about two million from fully funding it
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
and the tuition was short about three
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
million from fully funding it so uh
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
overall the 9 million was phenomenal
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
start but if we were to reimburse all of
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
the schools pay all the schools 75% and
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
fully fund
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
Transportation at last year's student
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
short uh and I can tell you that this
 
04:38:56.670 --> 04:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
year coming up although we're we're
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
excited about it from this end is um our
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
most of our CTE centers are over
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
enrolled the applications went through
 
04:39:05.039 --> 04:39:05.869 align:start position:0%
enrolled the applications went through
the

04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:09.269 --> 04:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
roof um an example I can tell you is
 
04:39:11.470 --> 04:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hudson School District which which this
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
year has 85 students from sending
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
schools accepted 200 sending school
 
04:39:19.629 --> 04:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
students for this coming
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
year uh and most of our other school
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
districts are reporting something very
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
similar and they're now actually having
 
04:39:28.189 --> 04:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
to do lotteries to determine which kids
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
can come into CTE because they receive
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
more applications than they have
 
04:39:37.190 --> 04:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
seats that's a real
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
problem so I think the the the uh
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that's put forward is uh a
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
step forward uh we've got to get Finance
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
to agree with us um in the Senate you
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
know I've spoken with folks in the
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
Senate side and if they can find
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
additional dollars somewhere I've asked
 
04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
that it be directed in in this area we
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
are really hurting in for technical
 
04:40:03.070 --> 04:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
education but gaining students and our
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
students uh when you take the
 
04:40:07.470 --> 04:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
achievement scores those kids in
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
CTE just equate either at or above the
 
04:40:14.190 --> 04:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
level of those that don't go to
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
CTE so um we're missing something here
 
04:40:19.510 --> 04:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh represent
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
Porter I'd like to get back thank you Mr
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to get back to what
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
representative Miler said earlier about
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
um and the example that he used was a
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
student that was going to Proctor
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
Academy and wanted to go to a CTE and
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
who would pay for the transportation but
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
also who pays the tuition to the CTE and
 
04:40:42.030 --> 04:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
I just looked up the cost of a private
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
school tuition at Proctor Academy is
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
$59,000 a year so is the state picking
 
04:40:49.200 --> 04:40:50.190 align:start position:0%
$59,000 a year so is the state picking
up

04:40:50.190 --> 04:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:40:53.708 --> 04:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
75% of the tuition cost for a student
 
04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
going to Proctor
 
04:40:57.910 --> 04:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
Academy and the school district is
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
taking the other 25% is that how this
 
04:41:04.708 --> 04:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
works oh there this the status covering
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
75% of the CTE tuition so each of the
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
CTE centers identify the cost of the CTE
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
education uh at their CTE center it's
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
based on the uh average cost of
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
educating the student in that at that
 
04:41:22.030 --> 04:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
high school is where the C so that is
 
04:41:24.110 --> 04:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
the 75% that they're covering not of the
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
private school of the just the the 90
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
minutes per day that they're at the CTE
 
04:41:32.830 --> 04:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
Center so the private school student
 
04:41:36.110 --> 04:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
basically does gets that that the state
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
pays for that for everybody not just not
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
just private not just public school kids
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
correct any anybody coming from a school
 
04:41:48.550 --> 04:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
that is not their home school uh for
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
example conquered has a CTE Center so if
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
a student attends conquered High School
 
04:41:56.590 --> 04:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
no money changes hands but if a student
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
attends any other High School in the
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
region and goes to conquered for CTE
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
right the state covers that piece to
 
04:42:04.350 --> 04:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
reimburse conquered for educating the
 
04:42:04.360 --> 04:42:05.788 align:start position:0%
reimburse conquered for educating the
child

04:42:05.788 --> 04:42:05.798 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure and the cost for tuition at all
 
04:42:13.070 --> 04:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
these CTE centers all 20 plus is
 
04:42:16.110 --> 04:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
Senator drastically different very much
 
04:42:21.628 --> 04:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
you know thousands of dollars
 
04:42:24.510 --> 04:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
difference okay
 
04:42:29.230 --> 04:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
um represent mil thank you repr as long
 
04:42:31.708 --> 04:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
as we got you here Eric I'm interested
 
04:42:34.350 --> 04:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
in I'm interested in what you said about
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
the the uh volume of people coming this
 
04:42:40.990 --> 04:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
year and having to do somewhat of a
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
lottery what has the advisory
 
04:42:48.030 --> 04:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
Council uh concluded as a result of that
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
and how might they what are they
 
04:42:52.868 --> 04:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
recommending as far as
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
expanding the CTA centers to accommodate
 
04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh the renewed interest in this program
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
so sure it um it it just literally just
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
came up in this past month's meeting
 
04:43:08.910 --> 04:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
because the applications for the CTE
 
04:43:10.510 --> 04:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
centers were all due in March so this
 
04:43:12.948 --> 04:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
was very new information honestly the
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
CTE centers expected lower numbers and
 
04:43:19.750 --> 04:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
they expected lower numbers because of
 
04:43:21.990 --> 04:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
the Corona virus pandemic nobody was
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
touring CTE centers so they didn't
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
expect this but because of it all of the
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
centers created virtual tours so what we
 
04:43:33.788 --> 04:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
believe is more students were actually
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
able to tour T virtually tour CTE
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
centers then were able to in the past
 
04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
and suddenly discovered it was available
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
to them and so this was a extremely
 
04:43:43.040 --> 04:43:44.190 align:start position:0%
to them and so this was a extremely
unexpected

04:43:44.190 --> 04:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
unexpected
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
turnaround um we had already been
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
talking about options and it it came
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
from the study that uh the Consultants
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
did around Equitable access and looking
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
for other options and several of our
 
04:43:58.510 --> 04:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
centers have started uh what we're
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
calling CTE after dark which is offering
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
additional CTE courses starting at 2:30
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
and it allows students um most
 
04:44:11.750 --> 04:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally from the host High School
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
to utilize the seats afternoon and that
 
04:44:16.990 --> 04:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
opens up seats in the daytime for more
 
04:44:19.948 --> 04:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
sending school students to come in uh so
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's um two or three of our centers
 
04:44:23.670 --> 04:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
that had been experimenting with it in
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
past years and will be expanding it for
 
04:44:29.310 --> 04:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
this coming year uh but on top of that
 
04:44:33.390 --> 04:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
we are U actively open for other options
 
04:44:34.510 --> 04:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh we are looking at the the
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities of potentially expanding
 
04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
CTE into non CTE
 
04:44:42.910 --> 04:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
centers um VX is offering for the first
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
time a 100% online cyber security CTE
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
program starting in
 
04:44:50.830 --> 04:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
September uh and so we'll be continue to
 
04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
look at other options uh so
 
04:44:54.430 --> 04:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative Milo we're we're open to
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
ideas and support from anybody of other
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
places and other ways we can expand
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
CTE uh without substantial costs so you
 
04:45:03.708 --> 04:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to be able to open
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
an auto program at every high school but
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
we might be able to expand some of the
 
04:45:10.030 --> 04:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
business programs or technology programs
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
into comprehensive high schools that
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
don't require specialized
 
04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:19.470 --> 04:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
you are you gonna be with us a little
 
04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
bit further here Eric uh I can stay as
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
long as you need okay good um just so
 
04:45:28.830 --> 04:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
the folks out there and and uh not with
 
04:45:31.470 --> 04:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
us here uh we know that the tuition at
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester is
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
$3,100 we know that in Berlin the
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
tuition is
 
04:45:41.230 --> 04:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
$7,300 um so there's big big differences
 
04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
between Center to Center uh as we move
 
04:45:47.550 --> 04:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
down through this uh particular bill
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's one area that uh I had a
 
04:45:52.590 --> 04:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
question regarding myself even after
 
04:45:56.708 --> 04:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
working with you on this um I get to the
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
page here uh there's a section where we
 
04:46:05.510 --> 04:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
deleted the fact that um
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
that in this section qualified means the
 
04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
project accepts students from sending
 
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
schools that's been
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
deleted um can you explain to me why
 
04:46:18.310 --> 04:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
04:46:21.708 --> 04:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
no why uh in this section qualified
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
means the project accepts students
 
04:46:26.270 --> 04:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it accept students from sending
 
04:46:26.280 --> 04:46:27.628 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it accept students from sending
districts

04:46:27.628 --> 04:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:46:31.230 --> 04:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
schools so yes so um there were some
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
editing errors on our end and how we
 
04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
were interpreting it we wanted to leave
 
04:46:38.430 --> 04:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
that line in the reason we had
 
04:46:40.910 --> 04:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
originally requested to take to take out
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
that U receiving from sending school is
 
04:46:46.510 --> 04:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
because several of our CTE centers don't
 
04:46:48.270 --> 04:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
have designated sending schools
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmith is an example of that and so
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
the way we were reading the legislation
 
04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
was because Portsmouth doesn't have any
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
sending schools they wouldn't be
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for the renovation
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
funds um however when the commissioner
 
04:47:08.110 --> 04:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
read our notes he said well if a student
 
04:47:10.750 --> 04:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
from do requested to go to Portsmouth
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't Portsmouth accept them because
 
04:47:14.910 --> 04:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
they have a program that do didn't offer
 
04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
and I said yes he said well then they
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
are willing to accept receiving students
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
so we had asked to to no longer remove
 
04:47:27.070 --> 04:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
that line from uh from the bill oh good
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
because I did I did put it back in in my
 
04:47:34.350 --> 04:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
copy just it looked crazy to me yes no
 
04:47:36.990 --> 04:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
we did so it was absolutely just however
 
04:47:38.190 --> 04:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
people were reading at the
 
04:47:39.868 --> 04:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh we didn't want
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth or North Conway or St be
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
Plymouth to miss out on the renovation
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
funds because they didn't have sending
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
schools uh but all of our schools are
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
officially receiving schools because a
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
student can attend any CTE Center if the
 
04:47:57.310 --> 04:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
one near them doesn't have the program
 
04:47:58.948 --> 04:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
that they're interested in or it's full
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
or let's say that they are a conquered
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
student but they're going to a private
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
school close cler to Plymouth they could
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
attend the Plymouth CTE Center instead
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the conquered one so okay so yes
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
please put it back in okay well in in my
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
copy it's in it's up to the committee
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
but we'll give it a shot um thank you
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
and the other other area that uh I've
 
04:48:24.390 --> 04:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
changed a little bit you in one section
 
04:48:26.990 --> 04:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about stem stem courses
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education courses
 
04:48:32.430 --> 04:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
is in bold then after that stem Capital
 
04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
STM science technology engineering
 
04:48:38.548 --> 04:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
mathematics and STEM related courses
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
that are fundamental and necessary for
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
success in postsecondary education
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
career pathway opportunities and the
 
04:48:45.760 --> 04:48:48.070 align:start position:0%
career pathway opportunities and the
meet

04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
meet
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
um when I was uh on the com council with
 
04:48:53.708 --> 04:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
Steve rothenberger and you and rest of
 
04:48:58.548 --> 04:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
them um we we had talked about Steve
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
always talked about the necessity to
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
have communication skills the kids have
 
04:49:07.350 --> 04:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to take a writing class
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
um just as much as it is to take
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
something in the area of technology so
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
we are trying to um open it up to more
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
than just stem to those other
 
04:49:20.670 --> 04:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
communication skills which are so
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
important for those going into these
 
04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
skilled areas is that agree with what
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're thinking as well Eric uh AB uh I
 
04:49:30.628 --> 04:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
think at the at the extreme end
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely what what this piece was uh
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
if I if I I'm correct is this is the um
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
accessibility to the scholarships for
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
the dual enrollment or the running start
 
04:49:44.548 --> 04:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
classes correct that's correct yes so th
 
04:49:47.708 --> 04:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
this was trying to um provide a little
 
04:49:50.350 --> 04:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
more Equity at the CTE centers because
 
04:49:52.350 --> 04:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
we offer say business programs and
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
marketing programs which those students
 
04:49:56.670 --> 04:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in the running start and
 
04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment courses but because
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're not STEM related those students
 
04:50:05.150 --> 04:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
weren't eligible but the kid next door
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
taking an engineering CTE program
 
04:50:09.990 --> 04:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
received the scholarship for the dual
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment program so uh this was uh
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
Senator uh Waters had asked if we could
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
edit this bill to include CTE programs
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
on the broad scale of being eligible
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
for uh the dual enrollment
 
04:50:27.390 --> 04:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship so those are some of those
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
are the basic changes we've added grades
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
10 11 and 12 that was there in this bill
 
04:50:35.910 --> 04:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh as we done it for the high schools
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
wanted for a career tech tech headed as
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
well so is there are there any questions
 
04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
on this part from
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee real important part of this
 
04:50:49.390 --> 04:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
bill I I this my favorite part of the
 
04:50:49.400 --> 04:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
bill I I this my favorite part of the
bill

04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
CTE okay well Eric wait a minute there
 
04:50:57.788 --> 04:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
rep Woodcock yeah and than last thought
 
04:50:59.548 --> 04:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
for Eric but it's about this part of the
 
04:51:02.430 --> 04:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
bill it was dealing back with uh the
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
full cost of Transportation that you
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
brought up before I had a question so I
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to wait on it no
 
04:51:10.948 --> 04:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and ask the question okay
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
um if I recall what you said that you'd
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
added it to a full cost of
 
04:51:18.430 --> 04:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation subject to funding yeah
 
04:51:20.830 --> 04:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
so if it's subject it seems to me like
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
that that that's it doesn't work it's
 
04:51:25.310 --> 04:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
either full cost or based on how the
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
state has done historically with things
 
04:51:29.910 --> 04:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
subject to funding negates the full
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
cost so we put subject to funding in
 
04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
there it kills it
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
I I this change was made by when Dave
 
04:51:39.990 --> 04:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
was talking with Senator Waters was
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
talking with me we understand Finance
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's always going to be a
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
struggle uh to get full funding we can't
 
04:51:50.830 --> 04:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
get it in just about anything we do from
 
04:51:55.868 --> 04:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
special ed to CTE to regor regor Ed um
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'm not bound subject to
 
04:52:02.670 --> 04:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
availability of funding but uh I'm sure
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the finance people are going
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
to end up
 
04:52:08.670 --> 04:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
doing okay just seems to me like it's
 
04:52:10.270 --> 04:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
sort of like a throwing up a throwing up
 
04:52:12.430 --> 04:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
a Hail Mary here you know we don't agree
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
on it okay thank you it's a a fluty pass
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
for sure but um let's hope that we can
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
get the
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
funding uh it's absolutely
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
necessary you know in a school I I we
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
have up there they're limiting the
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
number of kids can go based upon the
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
money they receive for
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
transportation and they only have so
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
many slots that's kind of
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
ridiculous but it's reality
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
too Corell represent
 
04:52:46.750 --> 04:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
Cornell on um well on my page six um
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 13 about the guidance
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
counselors doing career interest
 
04:52:54.548 --> 04:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
assessments is there going to be some
 
04:52:57.310 --> 04:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
kind of guidelin Statewide about that or
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
will that be up to you know every school
 
04:53:04.590 --> 04:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
just to decide how they want to do it or
 
04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
was there any thought to that Eric
 
04:53:10.830 --> 04:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
you're still there I'm so so thanks uh
 
04:53:13.548 --> 04:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
the the guidance that uh the department
 
04:53:16.230 --> 04:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
of Ed will be putting out will be around
 
04:53:18.548 --> 04:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh the definition of a career ready
 
04:53:23.708 --> 04:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
credential uh but the uh the use of a
 
04:53:26.548 --> 04:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
career assessment tool and the advising
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
that the school counselors provide is a
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
local individual decision uh at the
 
04:53:34.510 --> 04:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
department we are providing a way to as
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
a career assessment tool for any school
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
district that's interested in using it
 
04:53:40.990 --> 04:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh but uh that that comes down to a
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
local control decision okay thank you
 
04:53:48.910 --> 04:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
sure further questions of the
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
department not seeing any hands uh thank
 
04:53:53.350 --> 04:53:53.360 align:start position:0%

04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
day is there anything else on part three
 
04:54:06.190 --> 04:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:08.830 --> 04:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.390 --> 04:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
old okay ready to move on to part three
 
04:54:17.948 --> 04:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
yeah good repad Orman lad is it okay I
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
you okay part three is requiring
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
emergency action plans for sports
 
04:54:37.310 --> 04:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
I uh right on the first line I had a
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
problem uh my problem is that I'd like
 
04:54:45.788 --> 04:54:45.798 align:start position:0%
to see it read requiring emergency
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
action plans for co-curricular related
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
injuries and
 
04:54:54.310 --> 04:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
emergencies we don't say sports here we
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
say co-curricular all through statute we
 
04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
deal with that in terms of Athletics we
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
deal with that in terms of theater we
 
04:55:02.750 --> 04:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
deal that with anything that's
 
04:55:02.760 --> 04:55:04.230 align:start position:0%
deal that with anything that's
co-curricular

04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
co-curricular
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a definition for
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and the definition which
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
is in statute right now I'll read it to
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
you uh co-curricular shall include those
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
activities which are designed to
 
04:55:18.910 --> 04:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
supplement and enrich regular academic
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
programs to study provide opportunities
 
04:55:23.788 --> 04:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
for Social Development and encourage
 
04:55:25.830 --> 04:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
participation in clubs Athletics
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
performing groups and service to school
 
04:55:30.868 --> 04:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
and Community I've also added in I'd
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
like to put a definition including infam
 
04:55:32.878 --> 04:55:36.310 align:start position:0%
like to put a definition including infam
murals

04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
so um the the sports program we have is
 
04:55:41.120 --> 04:55:42.548 align:start position:0%
so um the the sports program we have is
basically

04:55:42.548 --> 04:55:42.558 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:55:45.150 --> 04:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
nhiaa and that's high school and
 
04:55:46.750 --> 04:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
possibly the eighth grade if you have a
 
04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
small school where you combine your top
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
level middle school kids with high
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
school kids to make that division level
 
04:55:57.910 --> 04:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
team or that co-ed team which is sports
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh so by co-curricular we open it up to
 
04:56:04.350 --> 04:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
include anything usually usually from
 
04:56:06.510 --> 04:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
grades what middle middle Elementary
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
grades intermediate levels 34 right up
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
to grades 12 uh I'd rather not put down
 
04:56:15.910 --> 04:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
a three through 12 I just like to
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
basically say in the next part the local
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
Board of educa of board of each School
 
04:56:24.430 --> 04:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
District or the governing body of each
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
non-public school shall establish an
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
emergency action plan for responding uh
 
04:56:32.670 --> 04:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
to co-curricular related injuries and
 
04:56:32.680 --> 04:56:34.230 align:start position:0%
to co-curricular related injuries and
emergencies

04:56:34.230 --> 04:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
so it's up to the local Board of each
 
04:56:39.310 --> 04:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
School District to develop a plan and
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
wherever any of these things that are
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
occur I I put together my remarks here
 
04:56:51.788 --> 04:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
you know and uh I'd like to just get
 
04:56:54.030 --> 04:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
this all emailed out to you so you can
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
have a copy of it
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
um uh so
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
um I've made changes all the way through
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
this saying um it'd be a lot easier if I
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
could just email this to you in fact do
 
04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
now we could email you a copy of this
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:31.390 --> 04:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
seconds I'm a little hesitant in
 
04:57:33.788 --> 04:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
referencing a lot of organ organizations
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
and associations and saying we will
 
04:57:39.510 --> 04:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
follow their you know
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
procedures um which those procedures can
 
04:57:46.948 --> 04:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
change um then statute has to change or
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
we it's just like uh we oftentimes do
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
with fire codes we identify a specific
 
04:57:55.868 --> 04:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
fire code so we don't have to and
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's we don't always we don't take
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily the most recent or updated
 
04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
fire code
 
04:58:06.430 --> 04:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
um Rick yeah
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
um in that section where you were
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
talking about including all
 
04:58:12.030 --> 04:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
co-curricular before you had said
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
something about all co-curricular and
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
and intermural activities is that what
 
04:58:20.590 --> 04:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
you were planning on putting in there in
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
my copy I just added inter murals in
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
that list right after where it says
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
Athletics inter murals performing
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
groups they they travel just as much as
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
well too and uh I think that there's got
 
04:58:36.868 --> 04:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
to be an emergency plan for all these
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
types of activities right I was just
 
04:58:41.430 --> 04:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
making sure they were actually all going
 
04:58:43.628 --> 04:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
to be covered because yeah everybody
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
should have an emergency action plan
 
04:58:53.600 --> 04:58:53.610 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:53.610 --> 04:58:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:58:59.110 --> 04:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
Tom no but let's let's uh try and get
 
04:59:06.580 --> 04:59:06.590 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.040 --> 04:59:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
first

04:59:34.510 --> 04:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad that's coming through I
 
04:59:47.670 --> 04:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
thought in the testimony the person who
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
was presenting was talking about that
 
04:59:52.070 --> 04:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is primarily for grades four to
 
04:59:54.830 --> 04:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
eight as the high schools already have
 
04:59:54.840 --> 04:59:56.270 align:start position:0%
eight as the high schools already have
these

04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:59:58.030 --> 04:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
documentations um particular for the
 
05:00:00.510 --> 05:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
sport piece and as I'm looking at part
 
05:00:02.670 --> 05:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
three it's the whole part three is is
 
05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
Rel it's a sport I mean it's it's like
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
seem going way off the and I'm not
 
05:00:09.510 --> 05:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the school building
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't have emergency plans it
 
05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't not have emergency plan unless
 
05:00:14.350 --> 05:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
you're Jing that at all I'm just say I'm
 
05:00:15.708 --> 05:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
reading this that whole P three was
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
specifically for school Sport and they
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
were focusing on middle school because
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
the high schools already have the train
 
05:00:21.948 --> 05:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
all those pieces applicable I just
 
05:00:23.708 --> 05:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
wonder if we're not really going Way
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
Beyond I'm not suggesting you shouldn't
 
05:00:26.590 --> 05:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
modify it just seems like we're going
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
Way Beyond the intent of of what part
 
05:00:30.670 --> 05:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
three was supposed to be and why it was
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
there because the middle schools weren't
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
programs yeah middle schools usually
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
have a combination of sportsin murals
 
05:00:42.030 --> 05:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
and it's inter mural usually at the
 
05:00:43.628 --> 05:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
elementary in high school it's usually
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
Sports and some inter mural
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the you have you have elementary
 
05:00:52.708 --> 05:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
schools that are competing against other
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
elementary schools sometimes with
 
05:00:57.030 --> 05:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
interal programs um they're traveling
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
they those kids are just as susceptible
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
to injury
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
or even if they're not traveling
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know why we wouldn't have
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
plan established to address all our
 
05:01:14.190 --> 05:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
students that are in co-curricular
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
activity well I I was if I may Rick I I
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
must suggesting you shouldn't all I'm
 
05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
saying is will you open it up to all
 
05:01:24.430 --> 05:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of co-curricular activities in the
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
school and every organization is
 
05:01:25.920 --> 05:01:26.788 align:start position:0%
school and every organization is
considered

05:01:26.788 --> 05:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
considered
 
05:01:29.670 --> 05:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
co-curricular um you know and and as is
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
inter murals um the science club is
 
05:01:32.400 --> 05:01:33.830 align:start position:0%
inter murals um the science club is
curric

05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
curric
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
the uh auto shop Club is C anything they
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
do that has in the school that's during
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
our after is co-curricular it's not
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
curricular so all I'm saying is I think
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
we've gone way as off off course here as
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
the the intent of part
 
05:01:53.230 --> 05:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
three but I'm not suggesting there
 
05:01:54.548 --> 05:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be emergency plans in all
 
05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
schools I'm just saying you it just
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
seems to we've gone way way off course
 
05:02:00.350 --> 05:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
when we when if that's our
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
by part part three it's basically just
 
05:02:15.070 --> 05:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
requiring action plans and I don't
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
understand why it's going away from the
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:27.948 --> 05:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
part I say because in the The Art Club
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have coaches it doesn't have
 
05:02:31.948 --> 05:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
licensed athletic training it doesn't so
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
all those types of things things are
 
05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
identified in part three uh were
 
05:02:38.548 --> 05:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
identified uh for sport or interm
 
05:02:41.310 --> 05:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
related athletic activities so once
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
again the the intent I think of this of
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
this change or addition to the the
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
regulation was not not to for all
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
co-curricula I understand your concerned
 
05:02:53.470 --> 05:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
for everyone having safety protocols
 
05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like that bus with no back
 
05:02:57.548 --> 05:02:57.558 align:start position:0%
rear exit I I understand that all I'm
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
just saying is it seems like we're going
 
05:03:03.150 --> 05:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
way off on this one and maybe maybe a
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
better way maybe a better way to address
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
it than try to re rewrite the entire you
 
05:03:09.070 --> 05:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
know take out coaches licensed out
 
05:03:12.030 --> 05:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
training is niia just that's all just
 
05:03:15.230 --> 05:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
seems to we're wrong right right cherish
 
05:03:15.240 --> 05:03:16.270 align:start position:0%
seems to we're wrong right right cherish
wrong

05:03:16.270 --> 05:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:03:19.948 --> 05:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
Q I hear you uh represent Mullen thank
 
05:03:22.910 --> 05:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um representative Woodcock
 
05:03:26.190 --> 05:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
would it not be as simple if
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative lad put co-curricular in
 
05:03:32.788 --> 05:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
as opposed uh co-curricular in inter
 
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
murals as opposed to using the word
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
Sports because Sports is part of
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
curricular and intermural activities
 
05:03:47.628 --> 05:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be just as simple as putting
 
05:03:52.030 --> 05:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
employees coaches athletic trainers and
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
advisors because all of those
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
co-curriculars and intermurals have to
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
have advisors so if you just added the
 
05:04:02.270 --> 05:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
word advisors I think it would globally
 
05:04:05.670 --> 05:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
cover everybody may very may very well
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
M's a fresh he's a fresh one
 
05:04:16.390 --> 05:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative lad I hear that I hear
 
05:04:17.948 --> 05:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
that feel free you feel free to
 
05:04:20.670 --> 05:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
discipline him at any point in time well
 
05:04:22.350 --> 05:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
you know I couldn't do it with some of
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
my cousins who grew up in Conway it's
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's just a strange atmosphere out
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
there um so the B had the shop in the
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
woods up there the north side of North
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
Conway so I guess what I'm I guess what
 
05:04:38.830 --> 05:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
I'm saying here representative uh is
 
05:04:41.990 --> 05:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
that I um agree with representative lad
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
that this would be a good opportunity to
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
get emergency plans in for all Student
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
Activities not just
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
Athletics my my concern is that you you
 
05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
have various clubs and theater groups
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
working after school
 
05:04:59.310 --> 05:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
hours um from you know getting ready for
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
plays or theater or there can be injury
 
05:05:04.628 --> 05:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
occur and there's nobody else in the
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
building the school nurse has gone uh so
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
that's where I see that need um we don't
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
identify anywhere in our statute if you
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
look at the military compacts or you
 
05:05:16.670 --> 05:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
work look elsewhere in terms of
 
05:05:19.110 --> 05:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers coming and participating
 
05:05:21.310 --> 05:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
in athletics we don't call it Athletics
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
or Sports we call it co-curricular
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
program and basically our co-curricular
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
definition includes everything that I
 
05:05:33.548 --> 05:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
read with the exception of inner murals
 
05:05:37.470 --> 05:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
and um that's due to the fact we mostly
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
referen to high school and upper levels
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
of middle school but now we're looking
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
at everything going up that has this
 
05:05:49.708 --> 05:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
type of a program most likely you know I
 
05:05:52.590 --> 05:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
I had an intermediate school at one time
 
05:05:55.150 --> 05:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
and the grades four through six very
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
very active intermural
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
program uh so
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
um I I I think we miss something if we
 
05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
don't have some kind of you might say
 
05:06:10.470 --> 05:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
for um uh co-curricular shall include
 
05:06:12.270 --> 05:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
those activities which are designed to
 
05:06:14.548 --> 05:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
supplement enrich regular curriculum
 
05:06:17.708 --> 05:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
programs of study provide opportunities
 
05:06:21.430 --> 05:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
for Social Development and then and
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
encourage participating in clubs
 
05:06:26.190 --> 05:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
Athletics and Inter murals stop right
 
05:06:28.030 --> 05:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
there but you wouldn't have your
 
05:06:28.040 --> 05:06:29.190 align:start position:0%
there but you wouldn't have your
performing

05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
performing
 
05:06:33.868 --> 05:06:33.878 align:start position:0%
groups uh which there could be issues
 
05:06:35.470 --> 05:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
Dave you have your hand up yeah yeah
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
Rick um thanks thanks for this and and
 
05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
um you know I think these are all really
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
good points and important points I guess
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to lose the baby
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
on on on this one and if starting with
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
sports um you know gets it gets it in
 
05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
and we certainly didn't have a hearing
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
on you know other co-curricular
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
activities um and what the what the
 
05:07:04.310 --> 05:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
impact um would be on school districts
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
but uh but if if we're in agreement on
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
on Sports then then then I think we've
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
got something in place with the with the
 
05:07:15.390 --> 05:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
Senate on on that part and if we do
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment if we do amend it there's a
 
05:07:21.708 --> 05:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
risk we lose the whole thing so um and
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
clearly there's been a lot more I think
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
incidences I mean I I bet a lot of us
 
05:07:27.948 --> 05:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
have have
 
05:07:31.110 --> 05:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
coached um I you know I coached Alpine
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
assistant coached Alpine you know here
 
05:07:35.868 --> 05:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
in hopkington for a bunch of years and
 
05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
yep I escorted kids with broken legs and
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
and um and stuff off um in fact we're
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
skiing at Blackwater over at Proctor
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
Academy and um and you know driving kids
 
05:07:52.110 --> 05:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
to conquered hospital so um yeah I mean
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
and and and clearly the stuff that makes
 
05:07:57.548 --> 05:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
news aren't the ski injuries they're the
 
05:07:59.590 --> 05:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
football injuries you know the heat
 
05:08:00.990 --> 05:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
stroke and some of the other things that
 
05:08:03.548 --> 05:08:03.558 align:start position:0%
are referenced in in the in the prop in
 
05:08:06.670 --> 05:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
the language here so I I'm I mean I'm
 
05:08:09.390 --> 05:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
good I'm good either way but I just
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose it well we we also
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
have in the legislation that was given
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
to us by the Senate it speaks to grades
 
05:08:19.628 --> 05:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
4 through
 
05:08:22.270 --> 05:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
12 so we're talking about elementary
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
school as well it also goes down and
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
addresses um document the proper
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
procedures to be followed when a student
 
05:08:32.190 --> 05:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
sustains a serious injury or illness
 
05:08:34.110 --> 05:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
while participating in school sponsor
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
sports or other athletic activity are we
 
05:08:40.430 --> 05:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
talking in rural um you you better start
 
05:08:42.670 --> 05:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
defining athletic other athletic
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
activity um the the bill as it's written
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
Now Sports is governed by nhiaa that's
 
05:08:54.070 --> 05:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
high school sports uh represent Woodcock
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
understands and knows that it does not
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
govern Middle School uh seventh grade or
 
05:09:02.350 --> 05:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
sixth grade or fourth grade or fifth
 
05:09:06.670 --> 05:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
great um it it so there but this bill
 
05:09:08.548 --> 05:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
does address 4th through
 
05:09:11.110 --> 05:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
12th so what's being done at grades 4
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
and 12 I as an elementary principal for
 
05:09:16.830 --> 05:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
years can tell you that we've had you
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
know when I was a principal over Rumford
 
05:09:22.070 --> 05:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
main we took our kids on competition all
 
05:09:25.150 --> 05:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
the way up to rangley main um that's a
 
05:09:27.788 --> 05:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
hell of a ride um over the height of
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
land and back down up the Rangely so um
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
murals so yeah
 
05:09:42.510 --> 05:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
um so another another question on on
 
05:09:46.350 --> 05:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
this Rick um um is this language that's
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
being adopted in other states and and is
 
05:09:51.990 --> 05:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
it really providing a blueprint um that
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
that the state and school districts can
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
follow for um um for sports 4 through 12
 
05:10:02.830 --> 05:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
um and by if we do expand it right now
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
are we are we having to reinvent
 
05:10:07.390 --> 05:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
something I mean I'm just I'm I'm just
 
05:10:07.400 --> 05:10:08.390 align:start position:0%
something I mean I'm just I'm I'm just
you

05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:10:11.070 --> 05:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
know again don't want to lose the
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
ability to move quickly
 
05:10:17.070 --> 05:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
um well I think
 
05:10:20.030 --> 05:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
I has her hand up I didn't know okay I
 
05:10:22.110 --> 05:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
think the answer your questions perhaps
 
05:10:23.788 --> 05:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
what you ought to do is that I don't
 
05:10:25.390 --> 05:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
know if Glenn's got that out to you
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
right now y um everybody should have it
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
you should look it over and and see
 
05:10:34.510 --> 05:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
where you are in that
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh okay you've got all of 148 so you'll
 
05:10:41.590 --> 05:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
have the next part as well um there
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
there was when we're looking at parts of
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
this bill right here the way it's
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
written I do have some real significant
 
05:10:50.430 --> 05:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
questions when you're sh sharing medical
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
information with a coach um how are you
 
05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
doing it where are you storing it
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
where's the coach keeping it how
 
05:10:59.788 --> 05:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
confidential is it uh are we following
 
05:11:02.788 --> 05:11:02.798 align:start position:0%
Hippa are we following furpa um that's
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
all important and um how much does a
 
05:11:09.628 --> 05:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
coach have to know every you know all
 
05:11:11.390 --> 05:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
the medical history of a student where's
 
05:11:14.350 --> 05:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
it start and stop um
 
05:11:17.788 --> 05:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
so um uh that's in the amendment that
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
you that you were sent by myself I've
 
05:11:25.110 --> 05:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
tried to identify that um
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
so I think the best way to because we
 
05:11:28.670 --> 05:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
could spend a lot of time here
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
discussing this right now I'd hope that
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
you would have had had this this uh
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:42.548 --> 05:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
over so represent likeus yeah I I you
 
05:11:44.590 --> 05:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
know I did print it off now and look at
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
it um I don't see that the changes are
 
05:11:51.230 --> 05:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
drastic compared to what the Senate did
 
05:11:52.990 --> 05:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I can't see why the Senate would
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
object to expanding from Sports to
 
05:11:58.030 --> 05:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
co-curricular and I will say there are
 
05:12:00.830 --> 05:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
plenty of other things you don't think
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
about like math club doesn't seem like
 
05:12:06.548 --> 05:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult math club
 
05:12:11.430 --> 05:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
does travel for competitions and I did
 
05:12:13.750 --> 05:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
have a case where a student ran into a
 
05:12:17.390 --> 05:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
door and split his head open so I mean
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's a stupid thing but those things
 
05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
happen so I'm just saying you know
 
05:12:25.948 --> 05:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
having a plan in place for whatever just
 
05:12:25.958 --> 05:12:30.830 align:start position:0%
having a plan in place for whatever just
make

05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
sense so I like the co-curricular I
 
05:12:39.788 --> 05:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
it well okay just look look this over I
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to resolve
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
anything today it's a work session to
 
05:12:50.708 --> 05:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
try to try to provide folks
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh areas which may be of concern areas
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
that are strength of strength um I think
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
the whole concept is a good one uh I
 
05:13:03.750 --> 05:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
think we need to tailor it though to
 
05:13:10.270 --> 05:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know how many athletic
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
trainers there are in all the high
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
schools 43% of the schools don't have
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
them I I would say that's that's right
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.350 --> 05:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
half I know we don't have one up in
 
05:13:30.150 --> 05:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and Woodsville has a pretty
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
strong division for baseball team and
 
05:13:32.878 --> 05:13:34.948 align:start position:0%
strong division for baseball team and
athletic

05:13:34.948 --> 05:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
athletic
 
05:13:38.750 --> 05:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
program so um I think it's important
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
that coaches and the employees that are
 
05:13:48.030 --> 05:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.750 --> 05:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
training want to go on to the next part
 
05:13:52.760 --> 05:13:54.430 align:start position:0%
training want to go on to the next part
y

05:13:54.430 --> 05:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
y
 
05:13:56.628 --> 05:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
yeah uh repesent Porter you have your

apologize I I'm going to need to leave
 
05:14:03.310 --> 05:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
the meeting and I didn't want to just go
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
blank on
 
05:14:07.628 --> 05:14:07.638 align:start position:0%

05:14:19.230 --> 05:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
margorie part five uh relative to
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:26.590 --> 05:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
four part
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
four oh a definition of a private uh
 
05:14:32.150 --> 05:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
postsecondary Career School we're
 
05:14:32.160 --> 05:14:34.708 align:start position:0%
postsecondary Career School we're
talking

05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:38.430 --> 05:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
yoga remember that yep
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
um I personally don't see a need for a
 
05:14:48.350 --> 05:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
it so um so Rick yeah yeah I I think
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
part n is the part that
 
05:14:59.350 --> 05:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
actually uh
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
excludes the um
 
05:15:06.430 --> 05:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh Fitness training and recreational
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
Wellness facilities and
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
so if if you take away n
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
then only such facilities that have an
 
05:15:19.470 --> 05:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
annual growth tuition of 100,000 or less
 
05:15:19.480 --> 05:15:21.750 align:start position:0%
annual growth tuition of 100,000 or less
are

05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:15:21.760 --> 05:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
are
excluded

05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't I don't have any
 
05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
ownership in any part of this bill
 
05:15:31.390 --> 05:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah so so I you know I did get I did
 
05:15:34.868 --> 05:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
get get some correspondence from um from
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the folks who are representing the
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%

05:15:44.110 --> 05:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
particularly the well not only um you
 
05:15:46.590 --> 05:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
know personal uh recreational Wellness
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know fitness clubs but also the um
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
the uh industry that trains the
 
05:15:55.868 --> 05:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
instructors for these um for these clubs
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
and um they actually suggest just a a
 
05:16:03.070 --> 05:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
minor um change in and to I think
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
address uh uh some concerns that um that
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
Steve Appleby had um expressed during
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing and and that's basically
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
replaced the word instructional program
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
the term instructional programs in um
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph n with vocational
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
instruction and um so um so it would it
 
05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
would exclude the um Fitness and and
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
wellness um uh
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know folks because you know that's
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
really not uh I mean most people don't
 
05:16:39.150 --> 05:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
go to Planet Fitness for vocational
 
05:16:41.910 --> 05:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
training purposes it's you know to you
 
05:16:46.548 --> 05:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
know work off whatever and um um uh and
 
05:16:48.510 --> 05:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
so it would exclude them and then for
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
the for the um for the facilities that
 
05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
do provide vocational training it would
 
05:16:56.590 --> 05:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
um require them to have assurity bond if
 
05:16:58.590 --> 05:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
they have the if they meet the tuition
 
05:16:58.600 --> 05:17:00.390 align:start position:0%
they have the if they meet the tuition
thres

05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
thres
 
05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:02.548 align:start position:0%
thres
threshold

05:17:02.548 --> 05:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay so you just basically scratch
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
instructional programs and replace a
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.070 --> 05:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
okay two hands
 
05:17:18.510 --> 05:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh represent yeah the
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
light yeah um since this is about
 
05:17:25.868 --> 05:17:25.878 align:start position:0%
providing aity Bond aren't the only
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
people we really care about providing a
 
05:17:31.390 --> 05:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
shity bond is those who take um pay
 
05:17:34.110 --> 05:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
payment upfront as opposed to those who
 
05:17:36.110 --> 05:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
do it like on a weekly or monthly or
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
whatever basis and shouldn't we just be
 
05:17:40.590 --> 05:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
saying that those are the ones that need
 
05:17:43.548 --> 05:17:43.558 align:start position:0%
to put up a security Bond those who
 
05:17:46.350 --> 05:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
collect you know the fees up front
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
because isn't that what we're worried
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
about if they go bankrupt or or whatever
 
05:17:52.270 --> 05:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
people should be able to get their money
 
05:17:54.150 --> 05:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
back but if they haven't already paid
 
05:17:56.350 --> 05:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
the money in then there's no money to be
 
05:17:56.360 --> 05:17:57.310 align:start position:0%
the money in then there's no money to be
given

05:17:57.310 --> 05:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
given
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
back so so that's in a diff so so um
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
yeah if I can address that real quick
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
Rick that's in that's in a different
 
05:18:10.150 --> 05:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
part of the law that's 188 gon 3 and so
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to put some some you know
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
change how that shity Bond practice is
 
05:18:20.830 --> 05:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
done for all um Industries then then
 
05:18:23.230 --> 05:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the place there but
 
05:18:25.150 --> 05:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
for this it's really just it's really
 
05:18:27.548 --> 05:18:27.558 align:start position:0%
just saying as it pertains to Fitness
 
05:18:30.430 --> 05:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
instruction if it's vocational training
 
05:18:34.270 --> 05:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
Fitness instruction ction um then in
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
tuition's above
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
$100,000 then you you you follow the
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
shity bond um
 
05:18:46.510 --> 05:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
procedure represent Celli thank you but
 
05:18:51.948 --> 05:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
also if you uh do not strike in um you
 
05:18:57.190 --> 05:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
are basically carving out a um benefit
 
05:19:01.548 --> 05:19:01.558 align:start position:0%
for just uh Fitness and Wellness uh
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
programs rather than um any um career
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
school with a tuition of under
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um you're excluding those um
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
from uh this legislation and requiring
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
them to have a shy Bond would we want to
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
make it um a little bit uh broader
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
businesses because I didn't think we
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
were allowed to do carve outs for
 
05:19:32.480 --> 05:19:35.270 align:start position:0%
were allowed to do carve outs for
specific

05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
businesses well I I think I think this
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
one here is to eliminate the confusion
 
05:19:43.150 --> 05:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
that uh that that that Stephen appelbe
 
05:19:46.750 --> 05:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
laid out which is all right so um
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
instruction is instruction is the local
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
Planet Planet Fitness is that considered
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
a um you know something that should be
 
05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
regulated under the Department of
 
05:19:58.868 --> 05:19:58.878 align:start position:0%
Education um because they provide
 
05:20:01.590 --> 05:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
Fitness instruction and and I I think
 
05:20:05.110 --> 05:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
clearly that's not what the what this
 
05:20:07.548 --> 05:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
level of vocation what this vocational
 
05:20:11.948 --> 05:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
training um uh chapter is designed to do
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
so so what this specifically does is
 
05:20:18.910 --> 05:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
clear up any any um misunderstanding as
 
05:20:22.110 --> 05:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
it applies to uh Fitness
 
05:20:25.708 --> 05:20:25.718 align:start position:0%
instruction um and uh makes it specific
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
to vocational training uh for for you
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
know for Training Fitness instructors
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
and and then sets the um set and and
 
05:20:39.190 --> 05:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
sets the um the charity
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
Bond hey Dave um this is uh Senator
 
05:20:46.628 --> 05:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
Ward's Bill I'm sure she got it from
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:57.948 --> 05:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
around oh he's got his hand raised y
 
05:21:00.510 --> 05:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
let's let's bring him in okay well he
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:08.910 --> 05:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
applebe good afternoon everyone good
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon Steve are you listening to our
 
05:21:16.110 --> 05:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
conversation here
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes yes question can I answer I I
 
05:21:21.990 --> 05:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was a carb out too so that's
 
05:21:24.110 --> 05:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
why I was saying it Nix it but you know
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
if there's more to this I'd like to know
 
05:21:31.230 --> 05:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
so um uh just if I could answer that in
 
05:21:32.510 --> 05:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
one moment I want to go back it was
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned before about schools that
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
don't take tuition up front that collect
 
05:21:39.830 --> 05:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
potentially day of class they're already
 
05:21:43.150 --> 05:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
Exempted so elsewhere in statute or in
 
05:21:45.190 --> 05:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
rule um we've already Exempted schools
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
that don't collect tuition up front so
 
05:21:50.548 --> 05:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
they're covered the addition of line n
 
05:21:52.350 --> 05:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
that we talked about during the
 
05:21:54.990 --> 05:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
hearing if you were to strike that
 
05:21:58.470 --> 05:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
entirely then um there would be no issue
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint my understanding the
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
Y schools who prompted this bill
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
um that line n doesn't exempt them if
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're over 100,000 in tuition but
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
because of its reference to Fitness
 
05:22:14.670 --> 05:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
instruction there is some question here
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
at the doe if that that this almost
 
05:22:20.110 --> 05:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
expands our scope of lure which we're
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
not in support of obviously um so
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
eliminating line n should still achieve
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
what the
 
05:22:32.510 --> 05:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
yoga um uh Community was was was asking
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
which is that their smallest schools be
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
Exempted um and it exempts by the way 14
 
05:22:40.030 --> 05:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
other small schools around the state who
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
are in a variety of
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
vocations so that the the the line of
 
05:22:48.750 --> 05:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
100,000 or less intuition being exempt
 
05:22:51.230 --> 05:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine but that line n does does
 
05:22:53.708 --> 05:22:53.718 align:start position:0%
make things a little wider and is a
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
concerning so you would not have a
 
05:23:03.548 --> 05:23:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
are we talking schools or
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
vocational programs or
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
vocational are these schools so we call
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
them you know air quotes schools um it's
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
it's postsecondary
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
education and um what we license are
 
05:23:25.510 --> 05:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
schools that are you know that teach
 
05:23:27.990 --> 05:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
people a profession something they can
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
go out and learn earn a living with now
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
of course that's a slippery slope right
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
but the the folks that we license are um
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
are bartending schools uh computer
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
schools dog groming schools where they
 
05:23:43.548 --> 05:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
actually teach a
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
vocation to a student who can then go
 
05:23:49.230 --> 05:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
out and get a job with that vocation um
 
05:23:54.110 --> 05:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
we we do have several um uh hair you
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
know uh cosmetology type massage type
 
05:24:00.990 --> 05:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
schools as well um that are licensed but
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
in all of these cases these are these
 
05:24:05.708 --> 05:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
are uh vocations that they're leading to
 
05:24:08.310 --> 05:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
so if a school advertises that it
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
teaches people how to um an occupational
 
05:24:16.110 --> 05:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
skill then they fall under this this
 
05:24:18.548 --> 05:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
statue and that's where the yoga folks
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
initially ran into trouble was they
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
advertise that they teach people how to
 
05:24:26.190 --> 05:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
become yoga
 
05:24:29.310 --> 05:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
teachers that's a profession that's no
 
05:24:30.750 --> 05:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
different than any other school that
 
05:24:31.990 --> 05:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
that teaches someone how to be a
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
professional dog groomer a professional
 
05:24:37.948 --> 05:24:37.958 align:start position:0%
bartender so hence you know that's why
 
05:24:39.750 --> 05:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
we're this is
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
here is they they had some heartburn
 
05:24:43.628 --> 05:24:43.638 align:start position:0%
over this this
 
05:24:46.230 --> 05:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
issue thanks Steve do do are there any
 
05:24:48.310 --> 05:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
other questions for Steve from the
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee Mullen represent Mullen thank
 
05:24:53.390 --> 05:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Steve for
 
05:24:57.070 --> 05:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
taking the question so with regards to
 
05:25:00.310 --> 05:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
entities that do make over $100,000 a
 
05:25:00.320 --> 05:25:01.510 align:start position:0%
entities that do make over $100,000 a
year

05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
um obviously the reason to have them
 
05:25:07.708 --> 05:25:07.718 align:start position:0%
take out aity bond is so that there's
 
05:25:10.510 --> 05:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
protection for people that have paid
 
05:25:13.990 --> 05:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
tuition or whatever uh into the program
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
if we were to strike
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
n is that protection offered somewhere
 
05:25:21.628 --> 05:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
else in
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
statute well n is actually
 
05:25:29.190 --> 05:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
new okay so that's now so it didn't
 
05:25:31.708 --> 05:25:31.718 align:start position:0%
exist prior to this bill all right okay
 
05:25:33.150 --> 05:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you that's all I need
 
05:25:33.160 --> 05:25:34.788 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you that's all I need
to

05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
know right and Rick the and Steve can
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
confirm me these are exemptions right
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
yes these are exemptions from from the
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
um the the U lure requirement lure
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for for postsecondary
 
05:25:54.910 --> 05:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
career schools and and you know in the
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
case of what's being um uh discussed
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
here um
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
then are you know programs that don't
 
05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
have curriculum and and and things like
 
05:26:09.628 --> 05:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
that so my understanding is that is that
 
05:26:13.030 --> 05:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
these these uh Fitness and recreational
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
Wellness um uh programs do want to be uh
 
05:26:19.548 --> 05:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
Exempted because they don't they don't
 
05:26:22.390 --> 05:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
really feel like they they fall under um
 
05:26:24.910 --> 05:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
what's the private post-secondary career
 
05:26:26.948 --> 05:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
schools and
 
05:26:26.958 --> 05:26:28.628 align:start position:0%
schools and
um

05:26:28.628 --> 05:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:31.548 --> 05:26:31.558 align:start position:0%
uh and let's see I'm also just sort of
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
looking I think there may be somebody
 
05:26:38.830 --> 05:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
represents these folks that that can
 
05:26:45.470 --> 05:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
certainly talk to it um with greater
 
05:26:47.230 --> 05:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
familiarity I think they might have
 
05:26:51.670 --> 05:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:54.910 --> 05:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
raised I don't know if it's Amy or Tom I
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
I mean it could be Tom could be Amy okay
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any further from Steve
 
05:27:00.240 --> 05:27:02.150 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any further from Steve
here

05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:27:04.150 --> 05:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
so Steve I want to make sure I
 
05:27:07.830 --> 05:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
understand if we take out n m will still
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
take care of the concerns of the people
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
the wellness and yoga instructors and
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
whatever all of them fall under M and so
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
we don't need n because M takes care of
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
them is that correct that's exactly
 
05:27:27.750 --> 05:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
correct and in fact um as I've said n
 
05:27:31.230 --> 05:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
widens the scope m is very succinct
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
any school with $100,000 a year or less
 
05:27:37.070 --> 05:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
of gross tuition is Exempted from
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
lure um and because in N you'll notice
 
05:27:43.390 --> 05:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
the 100,000 is there again so in fact n
 
05:27:46.670 --> 05:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
is almost redundant m is any school of
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
any kind and is a specific category you
 
05:27:53.470 --> 05:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
know specific uh types of schools but
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
they still the 100,000 so it n also does
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
seem redundant because M takes care of
 
05:28:02.470 --> 05:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
the issue thank
 
05:28:02.480 --> 05:28:04.548 align:start position:0%
the issue thank
you

05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:28:10.628 --> 05:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
okay um my constituent um feels that any
 
05:28:13.270 --> 05:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
income any
 
05:28:16.510 --> 05:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of income this is going to
 
05:28:19.590 --> 05:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
be a problem for them so are you talking
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
about taking out M as a
 
05:28:26.788 --> 05:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
mar so Emma would still put a
 
05:28:29.310 --> 05:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
restriction in there yeah it's very
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
would be 100 or thousand or less it's
 
05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's a that's a real clear L Line in the
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
Sand whereas the other sort of goes the
 
05:28:41.350 --> 05:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
other way with with a
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
car hey hey Rick yeah yeah I don't see
 
05:28:48.070 --> 05:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
how it can how how M can or sorry how
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
how n Nancy can can broaden it given the
 
05:28:56.270 --> 05:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
fact you've already got M
 
05:28:59.948 --> 05:28:59.958 align:start position:0%
that is one restriction n can only be
 
05:28:59.958 --> 05:29:05.430 align:start position:0%
that is one restriction n can only be
further

05:29:05.430 --> 05:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
limiting it can only be further limiting
 
05:29:10.750 --> 05:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
it might be redundant but I don't see
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.788 --> 05:29:17.798 align:start position:0%
way let me read it again to myself go
 
05:29:22.590 --> 05:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
ahead Glen yeah um and is talking about
 
05:29:22.600 --> 05:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
ahead Glen yeah um and is talking about
these

05:29:23.590 --> 05:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
specific types of businesses but with a
 
05:29:29.110 --> 05:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
gross income of over
 
05:29:32.830 --> 05:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
$100,000 well will require insurity Bond
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
but that that provision that necessity
 
05:29:39.310 --> 05:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
is already covered as stated at the end
 
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the sentence uh in 188g Colon
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
3 which requires the sh of bond so any
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
entity per M as in Mary um any entity
 
05:29:58.548 --> 05:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
with a tuition of under under
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
$100,000 is exempt including these uh
 
05:30:05.788 --> 05:30:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:09.628 --> 05:30:09.638 align:start position:0%
programs so so let so Le let's say
 
05:30:14.670 --> 05:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
you've got a a local gym that that where
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
where where there's um uh somebody that
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
leads a cycling class and that local gym
 
05:30:26.270 --> 05:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
has 300 members uh and the membership is
 
05:30:29.548 --> 05:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
$100 a month so they have gross receipts
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
of$ 400,00 th000 a year um I I don't
 
05:30:34.990 --> 05:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
think that would be uncommon for for a
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
local gym um they wouldn't qual they
 
05:30:41.110 --> 05:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be exempt under M but they
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
Nancy Yes actually they would be exempt
 
05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative luno already with the
 
05:30:55.830 --> 05:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
existing statute if the training they're
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
the classes they're conducting are
 
05:30:59.350 --> 05:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
avocational in nature so if they're
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
conducting spin classes unless they're
 
05:31:05.150 --> 05:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
teaching people how to conduct a spin
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
class as a profession right it's an
 
05:31:11.230 --> 05:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
avocational spin class they're exempt
 
05:31:13.548 --> 05:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
already under existing
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
law so again my the point that I've been
 
05:31:19.708 --> 05:31:19.718 align:start position:0%
making with this part and is in Nancy is
 
05:31:23.150 --> 05:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
by specifically naming teaching Fitness
 
05:31:26.750 --> 05:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
and recreational wellness and not
 
05:31:28.948 --> 05:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
delineating the vocational piece which
 
05:31:31.350 --> 05:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier we've widened the
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
net not restricted it and um whereas
 
05:31:39.868 --> 05:31:39.878 align:start position:0%
eliminating all ofen as in Nancy um
 
05:31:42.868 --> 05:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
would then revert to the current statute
 
05:31:45.390 --> 05:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
which states that the education must be
 
05:31:48.548 --> 05:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
vocational in nature in order for
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
someone to to fall under that statute so
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
the spin class at the local gym the
 
05:31:54.990 --> 05:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
fitness class in the
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
park yoga class those are already
 
05:31:59.080 --> 05:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
park yoga class those are already
Exempted

05:32:01.830 --> 05:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
05:32:04.628 --> 05:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
so where where's the disconnect here
 
05:32:07.708 --> 05:32:07.718 align:start position:0%
with the with the industry I I think the
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
industry has I I think
 
05:32:14.510 --> 05:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
um they are hung up on the fact that
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
although they advertise classes for
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
people to become yoga
 
05:32:20.750 --> 05:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
teachers they have been hung up on the
 
05:32:24.150 --> 05:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
fact that 90 plus% of their students
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
never go on to do that and those that do
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's a side job they do it part-time or
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
as a hobby job where they make a little
 
05:32:34.548 --> 05:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
bit of money and many of the yoga studio
 
05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
owners they have told us um even that is
 
05:32:39.708 --> 05:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
a side job that's not their main source
 
05:32:43.190 --> 05:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
of income well our statutes don't
 
05:32:45.628 --> 05:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
delineate primary sources of income and
 
05:32:48.510 --> 05:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
secondary if you earn income from it
 
05:32:50.390 --> 05:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's a profession that's a
 
05:32:55.070 --> 05:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
vocation therefore um you fall under
 
05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
under the current statute so I think the
 
05:32:56.558 --> 05:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
under the current statute so I think the
disconnect

05:32:57.750 --> 05:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
disconnect
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
is that although most of their students
 
05:33:03.150 --> 05:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
never pursue it as a profession we don't
 
05:33:05.548 --> 05:33:05.558 align:start position:0%
have the ability at the department to to
 
05:33:09.788 --> 05:33:09.798 align:start position:0%
to distinguish or or parse that um it is
 
05:33:12.750 --> 05:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
they advertise it as vocational training
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
therefore they fall under the current
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
statute so so so a yoga studio that
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
trains yoga
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
instructors that has less than I'm sorry
 
05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
um uh more than $100,000 a year in uh um
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
in in Gross
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
receips would fall under this um this
 
05:33:36.958 --> 05:33:38.350 align:start position:0%
receips would fall under this um this
doe

05:33:38.350 --> 05:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
doe
 
05:33:41.070 --> 05:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
regulation yes provided two other two
 
05:33:43.548 --> 05:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
other three other pieces one they have a
 
05:33:46.030 --> 05:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
physical presence in New
 
05:33:49.628 --> 05:33:49.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which makes sense right um two
 
05:33:53.830 --> 05:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
front as opposed to day of class and
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
three that that tuition exceeds
 
05:33:58.878 --> 05:34:01.390 align:start position:0%
three that that tuition exceeds
$800

05:34:01.390 --> 05:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
$800
 
05:34:03.628 --> 05:34:03.638 align:start position:0%
so if they don't if they don't meet any
 
05:34:08.670 --> 05:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
Exempted and by way of student
 
05:34:12.070 --> 05:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
protection I would just I think I
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned this in my testimony but we
 
05:34:15.708 --> 05:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
did have a precipitous closure in
 
05:34:19.230 --> 05:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
December of this past year that um we
 
05:34:22.590 --> 05:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
had approximately 71 students at a u
 
05:34:25.150 --> 05:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
nursing school that closed and because
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the bond those students are now
 
05:34:29.070 --> 05:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
collecting refunds on their tuition
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.750 --> 05:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
so here we are guys
 
05:34:38.760 --> 05:34:41.350 align:start position:0%
so here we are guys
gals

05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
gals
 
05:34:43.948 --> 05:34:43.958 align:start position:0%
um n in or
 
05:34:47.708 --> 05:34:47.718 align:start position:0%
out re can can we can we just hear from
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
I I think it might be Amy or
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
Tom let me see who's who we got they
 
05:34:55.310 --> 05:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
both have their hand raised Tom has had

his hand raised for a significant
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
okay you want me to bring them forward
 
05:35:17.750 --> 05:35:17.760 align:start position:0%

that on that piece of this Omnibus Bill
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
and I know the committee probably
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to go backwards uh however
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know we I did want to say that we
 
05:35:57.868 --> 05:35:57.878 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with expanding it
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
to co-curricular activities however
 
05:36:02.190 --> 05:36:02.200 align:start position:0%

05:36:51.548 --> 05:36:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
please hi everyone can you hear me yes
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
yes great thank you so much for having
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
me on my name is Amy go uh I'm an
 
05:37:01.990 --> 05:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
attorney for yoga Alliance I'm with the
 
05:37:04.590 --> 05:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
firm Pillsbury winr just like to add
 
05:37:06.628 --> 05:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
some clarity uh there was a question
 
05:37:08.470 --> 05:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
earlier about what's the disconnect with
 
05:37:10.110 --> 05:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
the industry so let me walk through this
 
05:37:13.548 --> 05:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
a little bit um there's two Provisions
 
05:37:15.510 --> 05:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
that are that are in consideration we
 
05:37:19.030 --> 05:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
have M for Mary which exempts you know
 
05:37:20.948 --> 05:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
institutions that make under
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and we agree that's great for
 
05:37:26.350 --> 05:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
small businesses in any industry but the
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
reason why n is needed and is a Nancy
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
from our perspective is because we've
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
experienced in recent months for the
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
first time um certain types of advanced
 
05:37:42.788 --> 05:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
yoga classes being uh reached out to and
 
05:37:46.310 --> 05:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
asked to be licensed as career schools
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
and this turns on the type of yoga class
 
05:37:51.670 --> 05:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about within the yoga
 
05:37:53.948 --> 05:37:53.958 align:start position:0%
industry and this is are the community I
 
05:37:55.990 --> 05:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
should say and this is global worldwide
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
and across the United States highlevel
 
05:38:01.310 --> 05:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
yoga classes are called yoga teacher
 
05:38:03.868 --> 05:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
trading that's a term of Art in the
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
community right it it it signifies a
 
05:38:09.670 --> 05:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
highlevel class where you learn very
 
05:38:13.230 --> 05:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
high level skills but as Mr applebe
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the majority of people are not
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
taking these classes to make yoga their
 
05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
profession and if they do go on to teach
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
yoga it's because they have a day job
 
05:38:26.070 --> 05:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
and they're teaching maybe a Class A
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
week right as something that is for them
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's a personal interest it's wellness
 
05:38:35.910 --> 05:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
and for this reason these classes have
 
05:38:39.430 --> 05:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
been mischaracterized as career schools
 
05:38:41.590 --> 05:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's not just the Sher bond issue
 
05:38:43.708 --> 05:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
there's also a host of other lure
 
05:38:46.030 --> 05:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that are simply
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
inapplicable to a school like this they
 
05:38:51.750 --> 05:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
don't have grades for example right it's
 
05:38:54.190 --> 05:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
not a Traditional School environment
 
05:38:57.030 --> 05:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
with transcripts Etc that would match up
 
05:39:00.030 --> 05:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
with what we think of as a career School
 
05:39:02.990 --> 05:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
now as Mr applebe very eloquently put
 
05:39:05.990 --> 05:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
the issue has been is the department
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel like they can make a
 
05:39:10.030 --> 05:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
distinction based on the way the
 
05:39:11.830 --> 05:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
statute's currently written they're
 
05:39:14.830 --> 05:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
saying we we there's our hands are tied
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
the way that statute is written because
 
05:39:18.670 --> 05:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
you have the word teacher in your
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
program you're vocational so the reason
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
n is needed is to give an exemption to
 
05:39:27.548 --> 05:39:27.558 align:start position:0%
these programs which really shouldn't be
 
05:39:30.270 --> 05:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
regulated as vocational schools frankly
 
05:39:32.350 --> 05:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
are not regulated in the majority of
 
05:39:35.868 --> 05:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
other states as vocational schools and
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
also aligned with New Hampshire law the
 
05:39:42.190 --> 05:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
reason the second Clause of n the one
 
05:39:45.468 --> 05:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
that you know adds a shity bond for
 
05:39:46.910 --> 05:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
those schools that have more than
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in revenue is to align with
 
05:39:52.670 --> 05:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
other parts of the statute we understand
 
05:39:54.390 --> 05:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
there are consumer protection concerns
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
and so we said okay maybe it's fair that
 
05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
those large schools provide a shity bond
 
05:40:03.150 --> 05:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
but if they provide a shy Bond under n
 
05:40:04.830 --> 05:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be subject to all the
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
other lure requirements that are a bad
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
fit for a yoga program so that's why n
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
is needed as an individual standal and
 
05:40:15.548 --> 05:40:15.558 align:start position:0%
exemption and I hope that brings Clarity
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
05:40:17.040 --> 05:40:18.830 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
you

05:40:18.830 --> 05:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:40:26.590 --> 05:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:32.868 --> 05:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought I'd already unmuted me
 
05:40:36.788 --> 05:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Amy for coming on and
 
05:40:39.270 --> 05:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
explaining that to us I do have a
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
question for you um if
 
05:40:46.990 --> 05:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
we just leave M Mary in and take out
 
05:40:49.868 --> 05:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
Nancy are there any yoga schools or
 
05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
instruction centers that would be caught
 
05:40:56.708 --> 05:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
up in that or would Mary take care of
 
05:40:59.708 --> 05:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
all of the um schools that are concerned
 
05:41:01.468 --> 05:41:01.478 align:start position:0%
about this so that you wouldn't have to
 
05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
do so that no yoga instruction schools
 
05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
would have to to do any of this stuff
 
05:41:09.190 --> 05:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a that's a really
 
05:41:11.548 --> 05:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
important question so the answer is I
 
05:41:13.310 --> 05:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
don't know because I don't have an
 
05:41:16.190 --> 05:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
accounting of every yoga program or
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
quite frankly you know programs that are
 
05:41:20.390 --> 05:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
aligned with yoga or similar to yoga in
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
the state but I think that if we if to
 
05:41:27.788 --> 05:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
operate and just say well M solves the
 
05:41:30.750 --> 05:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
problem right we're actually missing a
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
separate issue which is that these
 
05:41:35.910 --> 05:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
advanced yoga classes have been
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized so it means that we
 
05:41:40.990 --> 05:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
open the door in the future if there is
 
05:41:44.190 --> 05:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
a larger program for them to also be
 
05:41:46.830 --> 05:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized so it would seem to be
 
05:41:49.868 --> 05:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
better to create Clarity within the law
 
05:41:52.350 --> 05:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
about what the concept is of the
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
vocational program so that we don't have
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
this issue outstanding going forward
 
05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
into the future
 
05:42:00.440 --> 05:42:02.948 align:start position:0%
into the future
thank

05:42:02.948 --> 05:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:05.910 --> 05:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:42:09.070 --> 05:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
05:42:15.030 --> 05:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:18.190 --> 05:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
this anybody have it resolved in their
 
05:42:20.788 --> 05:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
mind everybody
 
05:42:20.798 --> 05:42:22.250 align:start position:0%
mind everybody
confused

05:42:22.250 --> 05:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
confused
 
05:42:22.260 --> 05:42:23.830 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:42:27.708 --> 05:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
yeah okay ready to move on to part five
 
05:42:29.270 --> 05:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
so where where do you want to go on this
 
05:42:31.510 --> 05:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
Rick how do you how do you
 
05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
determine an instructional program who
 
05:42:41.548 --> 05:42:41.558 align:start position:0%
decides whether 80% of what we do here
 
05:42:45.150 --> 05:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
is for teaching teachers how to instruct
 
05:42:48.390 --> 05:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
the other 20% is for you know somebody
 
05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
to come have a an experience to for
 
05:42:53.948 --> 05:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
wellness or to
 
05:42:57.468 --> 05:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
recreate well the other part of that is
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
she's talking about yoga but it doesn't
 
05:43:02.910 --> 05:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
say that in here it says Fitness and
 
05:43:05.468 --> 05:43:05.478 align:start position:0%
recreational Wellness which is really a
 
05:43:09.468 --> 05:43:09.478 align:start position:0%
much bigger category and I mean that
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
could even include gym teachers which
 
05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:23.390 --> 05:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
so so I don't see that n fits what we're
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.040 --> 05:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
fix

05:43:29.200 --> 05:43:29.210 align:start position:0%
fix
 
05:43:29.210 --> 05:43:35.270 align:start position:0%
fix
[Music]

05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:39.628 --> 05:43:39.638 align:start position:0%
you think rson hops yeah um chairman lad
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
um Mr applebe gave um a list of three
 
05:43:46.590 --> 05:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
criteria I can't remember the third one
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
but one was 800 plus for a class yeah um
 
05:43:54.270 --> 05:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
being in new hire and then there was the
 
05:43:58.150 --> 05:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
third one so um you all will remember
 
05:44:02.430 --> 05:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
that um yoga person that I had attended
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
a retreat it was a one-time thing $1,000
 
05:44:09.150 --> 05:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
for the weekend but it was a whole
 
05:44:12.110 --> 05:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
weekend which included everything she
 
05:44:14.868 --> 05:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
would she would fall under this am I not
 
05:44:18.468 --> 05:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
correct she would be taxed or
 
05:44:22.750 --> 05:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh needed to to get a license pay the
 
05:44:27.150 --> 05:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
fees um so it's it's not necessarily a
 
05:44:29.430 --> 05:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
source of income for her it's so one and
 
05:44:31.670 --> 05:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
done maybe she does it twice a year I
 
05:44:34.110 --> 05:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
really don't know particularly but I'm
 
05:44:38.030 --> 05:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about her as this is
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
going would
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
she would she have had over aund th
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
$1,000 from that in the course of a
 
05:44:51.548 --> 05:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
year oh no I think no I think there were
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
probably M would have t m would take
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
care of
 
05:44:54.638 --> 05:44:57.868 align:start position:0%
care of
her

05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:01.628 --> 05:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
right Mr chair $1,000 you could go to
 
05:45:05.350 --> 05:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
Atlanta go there okay I
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
know yes re Leon uh thank you Mr chair
 
05:45:11.628 --> 05:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
it seems like we have two issues here in
 
05:45:15.628 --> 05:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
N we're casting a very wide net on the
 
05:45:17.868 --> 05:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
off on the chance that any of these
 
05:45:20.868 --> 05:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
these uh programs are large enough that
 
05:45:23.868 --> 05:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
the name teacher in the training program
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
is going to cause a problem now right
 
05:45:28.510 --> 05:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
now this is a self-identified teacher
 
05:45:30.390 --> 05:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
training tring and we're trying to
 
05:45:32.310 --> 05:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
change the statutes for more than just
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
this yoga instruction because of a term
 
05:45:37.750 --> 05:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
of art if this isn't currently a problem
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
then perhaps we should get rid of N and
 
05:45:43.190 --> 05:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
address this look at it maybe for next
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
session to figure out if there's a
 
05:45:47.948 --> 05:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
better way to make these things that are
 
05:45:50.708 --> 05:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
teacher style training maybe there needs
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
to be some modification in how it's how
 
05:45:55.468 --> 05:45:55.478 align:start position:0%
it's addressed in the term of Art and
 
05:45:56.910 --> 05:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
that's not really something to change
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
the statutes for everybody else
 
05:46:01.948 --> 05:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
um for this one chance to catch somebody
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
problem yeah I I you know trying to
 
05:46:09.430 --> 05:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
distinguish between you know what you
 
05:46:11.110 --> 05:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
get going to that for a recreational
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
purpose or you going to become an
 
05:46:15.628 --> 05:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
instructor a teacher who discerns that
 
05:46:17.310 --> 05:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
does the Department of Education well we
 
05:46:19.510 --> 05:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
have a doe of one person that's not
 
05:46:20.750 --> 05:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
05:46:23.590 --> 05:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
that and and so then it's up to the
 
05:46:26.708 --> 05:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
individual entity to do that and how are
 
05:46:28.030 --> 05:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
you which way you going to go are you
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
going to go well maybe 60 here 40 there
 
05:46:33.070 --> 05:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
no maybe 20 then 80 you know depending
 
05:46:36.190 --> 05:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
upon where I filter out in terms of what
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
kind of benefits I'm G to get out of
 
05:46:41.708 --> 05:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
It's seems very subjective to me and
 
05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
it's it seems to be a bit of a consumer
 
05:46:46.510 --> 05:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
protection issue too perhaps people
 
05:46:48.270 --> 05:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
understand that teacher training isn't
 
05:46:51.868 --> 05:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
really teacher training but this whole
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
point is to protect people um about
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
their what they may consider an
 
05:46:58.830 --> 05:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
investment in a career so having that
 
05:47:01.070 --> 05:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
name in it could bring bigger questions
 
05:47:03.150 --> 05:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
so I think that it doesn't seem like
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's a current pressing problem right
 
05:47:07.230 --> 05:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
now getting R of in and looking at this
 
05:47:09.030 --> 05:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
more comprehensively when we can
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually meet in person and do this
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
might make sense represent cordelli yes
 
05:47:17.670 --> 05:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
and uh am might solve the problem for
 
05:47:21.270 --> 05:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
all these um uh yoga
 
05:47:24.310 --> 05:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
instructional um programs that we
 
05:47:30.190 --> 05:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
discussed and that we not testimony of
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
um schools that have the to gross
 
05:47:41.390 --> 05:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
$100,000 further discussion from anybody
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
out there so Dave how you feel about
 
05:47:50.190 --> 05:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
this right now yeah I mean I I I think
 
05:47:53.310 --> 05:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that uh and is and
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
Nancy is not talking about um you know
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
keing State un you know uh that's
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
educating uh PE
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
instructors in fact um those schools
 
05:48:08.548 --> 05:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
that confer degrees are already carved
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
out of of this statute so when you look
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
at um at
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
188g I don't know one something like
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
that um uh it already it already talks
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
about that I think I think you know and
 
05:48:24.390 --> 05:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
is and Nancy's pretty specific here when
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's when it's talking about nope
 
05:48:31.110 --> 05:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
this this is no not talking about um um
 
05:48:34.990 --> 05:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
your local um um you know gym or Fitness
 
05:48:37.230 --> 05:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
club and it's not talking about
 
05:48:41.070 --> 05:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that uh that teach um uh
 
05:48:44.390 --> 05:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
yoga instructors to be yoga instructors
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
and uh unless and and if you're if
 
05:48:51.070 --> 05:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
you're a big you know Fitness Company
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
like there are some like less Mills and
 
05:48:54.590 --> 05:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
stuff like that I don't know if they do
 
05:48:57.788 --> 05:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
any instruction in New Hampshire that
 
05:48:59.788 --> 05:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
that take in more than
 
05:49:03.390 --> 05:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
$100,000 then um then you know you'd pay
 
05:49:06.030 --> 05:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
you you'd have to put up the shity bond
 
05:49:08.548 --> 05:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
um uh but otherwise you wouldn't be
 
05:49:10.910 --> 05:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
subject to the other licensing
 
05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
regulations uh uh you know I you know I
 
05:49:17.070 --> 05:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see the harm in leaving leaving
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
it in I mean uh you know otherwise it's
 
05:49:24.868 --> 05:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
just it it um and is and Nancy I don't
 
05:49:26.830 --> 05:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
think makes it subjective I think it
 
05:49:30.110 --> 05:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
makes it very specific uh otherwise uh
 
05:49:32.350 --> 05:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're gonna have to dance around
 
05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
the other ones and you know try to
 
05:49:38.670 --> 05:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
figure out you know noncredit non-degree
 
05:49:41.510 --> 05:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
granting Authority you know and get into
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
um you know um a fight over those things
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
so I I think it clear I think n clears
 
05:49:47.120 --> 05:49:48.830 align:start position:0%
so I I think it clear I think n clears
it

05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
up any other
 
05:49:56.110 --> 05:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:59.390 --> 05:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
sleeping I kind of go the other way in
 
05:50:01.628 --> 05:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
that N I think makes it more confusing
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i' just ass soon just see just m in
 
05:50:08.990 --> 05:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
um which yes would would
 
05:50:12.030 --> 05:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
um help other businesses other than just
 
05:50:14.270 --> 05:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
yoga instructors that may have nothing
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
to do with Fitness but if they're making
 
05:50:19.270 --> 05:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
if they're not making that much I don't
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
see a problem anyways but
 
05:50:26.350 --> 05:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
um a r to me teaching Fitness and
 
05:50:29.190 --> 05:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
recreational Wellness is just just a big
 
05:50:29.200 --> 05:50:30.868 align:start position:0%
recreational Wellness is just just a big
category

05:50:30.868 --> 05:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
category
 
05:50:30.878 --> 05:50:32.050 align:start position:0%
category
and

05:50:32.050 --> 05:50:32.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:50:32.060 --> 05:50:34.830 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

05:50:34.830 --> 05:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
next well we'll we'll see next Thursday
 
05:50:40.990 --> 05:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
when everybody brings forth their
 
05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
amendments yeah so Rick what why don't
 
05:50:45.270 --> 05:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
we what why don't we bring bring them
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
forward both ways um you know if there's
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
if there's people that want N Out we can
 
05:50:53.750 --> 05:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm I think everybody's saying
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
leave Mary em Mary em is and Mary in
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
leave that one in and have one without n
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
and have one with n with instructional
 
05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
programs um changed to vocational
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
instruction and then we can we can hack
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
through it during the
 
05:51:14.910 --> 05:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
exac probably will be the only way of
 
05:51:20.948 --> 05:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:20.958 --> 05:51:22.868 align:start position:0%
 
November

05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
November
 
05:51:25.990 --> 05:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
we yeah we can leave it in and and then
 
05:51:29.150 --> 05:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
take one November out yeah
 
05:51:29.160 --> 05:51:31.270 align:start position:0%
take one November out yeah
yeah

05:51:31.270 --> 05:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
so let's move
 
05:51:36.628 --> 05:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
on yeah I need some coffee here yeah
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
have some coffee out
 
05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
there I'll take four milks in
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
it okay next part five relative to
 
05:51:48.628 --> 05:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
environmental and outdoor
 
05:51:51.430 --> 05:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
education um if you've received anything
 
05:51:54.030 --> 05:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
from myself you know that I'm looking uh
 
05:51:56.590 --> 05:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
to uh this this build really has two
 
05:51:58.750 --> 05:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
parts the first part is finding
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
basically session law which goes away in
 
05:52:03.110 --> 05:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
a while anyways a lot of why we do this
 
05:52:06.788 --> 05:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
why it's more of a a background um the
 
05:52:09.270 --> 05:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
big the teeth in this thing is really
 
05:52:11.948 --> 05:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
when you get down to the criteria for an
 
05:52:11.958 --> 05:52:13.310 align:start position:0%
when you get down to the criteria for an
adequate

05:52:13.310 --> 05:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:52:15.750 --> 05:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
education and that's where the the teeth
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill is
 
05:52:21.150 --> 05:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
there um and it's it's there as a result
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
of some of the things we're trying some
 
05:52:24.468 --> 05:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do in Career Technical
 
05:52:26.350 --> 05:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
Education Without thr recreation in our
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
state as an as an industry and they're
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
teaching more outdoor recreation courses
 
05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
at the CTE centers now than they have in
 
05:52:36.030 --> 05:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
in a
 
05:52:39.948 --> 05:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
while so look uh I've changed the part
 
05:52:43.190 --> 05:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
five title to read relative to
 
05:52:47.390 --> 05:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
environmental science and outdoor
 
05:52:50.430 --> 05:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
recreation one because I think that the
 
05:52:52.190 --> 05:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
environmental science is something we're
 
05:52:54.750 --> 05:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
speaking to in the criteria for an
 
05:52:54.760 --> 05:52:56.948 align:start position:0%
speaking to in the criteria for an
adequate

05:52:56.948 --> 05:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:52:59.948 --> 05:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
education and outdoor recreation I've
 
05:53:01.110 --> 05:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
already talked
 
05:53:03.990 --> 05:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
about I took all the findings and
 
05:53:07.150 --> 05:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
stripped them all out um there's a lot
 
05:53:09.468 --> 05:53:09.478 align:start position:0%
of stuff there which is nice know it
 
05:53:14.190 --> 05:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
leads up to the therefore we shall um
 
05:53:20.190 --> 05:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
disappears so then what I'd like to just
 
05:53:26.910 --> 05:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
talk quickly about where I should go of
 
05:53:28.990 --> 05:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
course it's just Rick lad
 
05:53:31.468 --> 05:53:31.478 align:start position:0%
um under the criteria for an adequate
 
05:53:33.830 --> 05:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
education and I've communicated this
 
05:53:36.430 --> 05:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
with the maker of this bill too with the
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
senator and I have agreement on this
 
05:53:41.948 --> 05:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
part the knowledge of biological
 
05:53:44.830 --> 05:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
physical and Earth Sciences including
 
05:53:46.510 --> 05:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
Crossing out
 
05:53:50.670 --> 05:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
climate and put earth
 
05:53:53.548 --> 05:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
scientists including environmental
 
05:53:56.510 --> 05:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
science that investigates the complex
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
complex interaction of physical chemical
 
05:54:02.030 --> 05:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
and biological processes that take place
 
05:54:04.910 --> 05:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
on the earth to enable them to
 
05:54:06.750 --> 05:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
understand and appreciate the world and
 
05:54:08.670 --> 05:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
the engineering socioeconomic and
 
05:54:12.110 --> 05:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
geopolitical challenges around them what
 
05:54:16.510 --> 05:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
I've done here and working with um Dave
 
05:54:19.070 --> 05:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
is try to blend in language we have in
 
05:54:22.070 --> 05:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
HB 242 dealing with the the latter part
 
05:54:24.150 --> 05:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
there and dealing with the biological
 
05:54:26.628 --> 05:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
physical and Earth sciences and how that
 
05:54:28.750 --> 05:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
impacts the engineering soci economic
 
05:54:30.910 --> 05:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
and geopolitical challenges we're facing
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
in this world and we're facing some very
 
05:54:37.310 --> 05:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
serious issues climate is going to
 
05:54:39.910 --> 05:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
generate a lot of controversy there's a
 
05:54:42.990 --> 05:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
lot of issues on climate and even though
 
05:54:46.030 --> 05:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's a part of science it's also an
 
05:54:48.628 --> 05:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
issue which is uh debatable amongst
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
people as how it's being used and how
 
05:54:52.868 --> 05:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:55.868 --> 05:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
interpreted the second part which I I
 
05:54:55.878 --> 05:54:56.990 align:start position:0%
interpreted the second part which I I
may

05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:54:57.000 --> 05:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
may
modified

05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:05.670 --> 05:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
deals with uh another uh uh area that
 
05:55:08.990 --> 05:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
would be modified within our uh criteria
 
05:55:10.670 --> 05:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education we already
 
05:55:13.590 --> 05:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
have sound sound wellness envir and
 
05:55:13.600 --> 05:55:14.948 align:start position:0%
have sound sound wellness envir and
environmental

05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
practices and I and then of course the
 
05:55:19.910 --> 05:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill had including Recreation to enable
 
05:55:24.270 --> 05:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
them that's that's uh the way the bill
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
was and the next uh uh criteria
 
05:55:28.958 --> 05:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
was and the next uh uh criteria
are

05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:55:32.948 --> 05:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
are for an adequate education and skills
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
for lifelong learning including
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
interpersonal and technical skills I
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
took out Environmental Education skills
 
05:55:42.510 --> 05:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
to enable them to learn work and
 
05:55:44.270 --> 05:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
communicate and participate effectively
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
in a changing society and
 
05:55:51.070 --> 05:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
environment and so that those are the
 
05:55:54.030 --> 05:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
changes I I'd like to you know that I'd
 
05:55:58.230 --> 05:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
like to propose uh it's now open to that
 
05:56:00.190 --> 05:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
the whole bill is open or part five is
 
05:56:02.510 --> 05:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
open for
 
05:56:04.948 --> 05:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
discussion by the way I emailed that's
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:11.360 --> 05:56:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:56:13.910 --> 05:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:56:16.750 --> 05:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
discussion chairman lad are these
 
05:56:18.948 --> 05:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
changes you discussed with Senator
 
05:56:23.110 --> 05:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
Waters the I I am not discussed with him
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
the part the findings all those findings
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
I I just I took them out by
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
myself um after the advisory council
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
meeting he said he had been trying to
 
05:56:37.788 --> 05:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
get in touch with you to talk over some
 
05:56:40.830 --> 05:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
of these I I talked with him regarding
 
05:56:42.430 --> 05:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
the latter part the criteria for
 
05:56:42.440 --> 05:56:43.590 align:start position:0%
the latter part the criteria for
inadequate

05:56:43.590 --> 05:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
05:56:46.868 --> 05:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
education must be two days ago
 
05:56:51.270 --> 05:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you not the finings I like
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
I've said before there's a lot of
 
05:56:54.270 --> 05:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
information there
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
yes but it's nothing that's going to
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
remain in stat
 
05:57:00.868 --> 05:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
law it's all session law it's all going
 
05:57:02.468 --> 05:57:02.478 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:57:06.270 --> 05:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
gone it doesn't doesn't put anything in
 
05:57:06.280 --> 05:57:07.190 align:start position:0%
gone it doesn't doesn't put anything in
the

05:57:07.190 --> 05:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:57:13.500 --> 05:57:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:19.788 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:57:19.788 --> 05:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:19.798 --> 05:57:24.430 align:start position:0%
 
information

05:57:24.430 --> 05:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:27.070 --> 05:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
Rick oh represent leus I didn't see up
 
05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
in the corner here yeah I just had a
 
05:57:34.708 --> 05:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
question uh in part seven you took out
 
05:57:37.430 --> 05:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Education
 
05:57:41.468 --> 05:57:41.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
wondering I guess I would have put en
 
05:57:43.680 --> 05:57:45.150 align:start position:0%
wondering I guess I would have put en
invironmental

05:57:45.150 --> 05:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
invironmental
 
05:57:49.310 --> 05:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
skills just because it is important for
 
05:57:52.110 --> 05:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
lifelong learning Etc um I'm just
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.718 --> 05:57:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
all

05:57:59.590 --> 05:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:58:01.430 --> 05:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
well we have to have those interpersonal
 
05:58:03.070 --> 05:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
skills and technical skills which are
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
associated with working communicating
 
05:58:08.868 --> 05:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
participating effectively in our
 
05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
changing society and
 
05:58:11.120 --> 05:58:13.628 align:start position:0%
changing society and
environment

05:58:13.628 --> 05:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:58:16.948 --> 05:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
uh I I I'm looking at the skills that
 
05:58:21.390 --> 05:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
contribute to how we change and and work
 
05:58:24.590 --> 05:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
within our environment so
 
05:58:27.468 --> 05:58:27.478 align:start position:0%
um environmental skills alici I'd ask
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:33.230 --> 05:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
please environmental skills are going to
 
05:58:35.910 --> 05:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
be basically using many of the the
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
subjects which we teach could be in
 
05:58:40.990 --> 05:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
geology it could be in geography it
 
05:58:43.750 --> 05:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
could be in uh all the different types
 
05:58:46.070 --> 05:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
of biological sciences and physical
 
05:58:49.590 --> 05:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:52.628 --> 05:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
Sciences so you think the technological
 
05:58:55.390 --> 05:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
skills would be sufficient to cover all
 
05:58:58.510 --> 05:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
of the environmental skills
 
05:58:58.520 --> 05:58:59.390 align:start position:0%
of the environmental skills
well

05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:59:01.788 --> 05:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
interpersonal working with each
 
05:59:06.350 --> 05:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
other pardon me and technical skills yes
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh to enable them to learn work
 
05:59:10.788 --> 05:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
communicate and participate effectively
 
05:59:13.708 --> 05:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
in our changing environment I'm not
 
05:59:16.510 --> 05:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
talking about environmental skills um
 
05:59:18.230 --> 05:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
the environmental
 
05:59:21.868 --> 05:59:21.878 align:start position:0%
skills I I just I'm having a hard time
 
05:59:26.070 --> 05:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
finding that in isolation you go look up
 
05:59:27.670 --> 05:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
environment and you're going to find
 
05:59:29.788 --> 05:59:29.798 align:start position:0%
find all these subjects that we teach
 
05:59:30.670 --> 05:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
and we
 
05:59:35.670 --> 05:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
do so I guess I'm Clarity too I guess I
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
was just looking because you put it up
 
05:59:41.230 --> 05:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
above including environmental science
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so to me the things the skills that
 
05:59:46.110 --> 05:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
you learn from environmental science
 
05:59:48.670 --> 05:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
would be environmental skills so I'm
 
05:59:50.590 --> 05:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
wondering why you took it back out when
 
05:59:52.948 --> 05:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
you put it in up above it just seemed
 
05:59:55.868 --> 05:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
environmental science is the science of
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
environment and it it
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
incorporates many many subjects uh it's
 
06:00:05.708 --> 06:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
not a science unto itself it's almost a
 
06:00:11.708 --> 06:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:14.270 --> 06:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
categories it could be underneath
 
06:00:18.510 --> 06:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
geography could be underneath uh biology
 
06:00:18.520 --> 06:00:22.628 align:start position:0%
geography could be underneath uh biology
chemistry

06:00:22.628 --> 06:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:26.310 --> 06:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
physics yes repr cardelli no thank you
 
06:00:28.030 --> 06:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think in one place you're talking
 
06:00:29.868 --> 06:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
about knowledge and the other place
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
you're talking about skills yeah um I
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what environmental
 
06:00:42.030 --> 06:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:47.230 --> 06:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
be I would think gardening and uh tree
 
06:00:50.030 --> 06:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
trimming and all those kinds of things
 
06:00:53.310 --> 06:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
would come under environmental skills is
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
Eric croi still here because we
 
06:00:58.350 --> 06:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
discussed this at the advisory council
 
06:01:00.628 --> 06:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
is Eric
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:16.468 --> 06:01:16.478 align:start position:0%
no when I talk with uh Senator Waters he
 
06:01:19.430 --> 06:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
said the most important part is that we
 
06:01:22.030 --> 06:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
make sure we got outdoor recre including
 
06:01:25.150 --> 06:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation that is a program
 
06:01:27.868 --> 06:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
which gives then direction to the for
 
06:01:31.948 --> 06:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
technical education to get into the the
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
industry or the business of outdoor
 
06:01:37.270 --> 06:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
recreation which is a key industry to
 
06:01:37.280 --> 06:01:38.030 align:start position:0%
recreation which is a key industry to
our

06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:01:42.548 --> 06:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
state uh profession and with that as a
 
06:01:44.830 --> 06:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
part of the criteria for an adequate
 
06:01:47.350 --> 06:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
education it gives them the open door
 
06:01:49.990 --> 06:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
the green light to pursue uh that type
 
06:01:54.590 --> 06:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.548 --> 06:02:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
um and did
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
you we've sort of touched around it in
 
06:02:10.708 --> 06:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
the last minute we live in an
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
environment it's a
 
06:02:17.830 --> 06:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
noun what skills are associated with the
 
06:02:21.270 --> 06:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
word environment I I can't make
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:26.360 --> 06:02:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
other

06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:39.948 --> 06:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:51.230 --> 06:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:55.310 --> 06:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
m not not an MD you're still muted there
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
you go thanks
 
06:03:00.788 --> 06:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman as a
 
06:03:02.350 --> 06:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
former student of
 
06:03:05.070 --> 06:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
geology perhaps some terminology might
 
06:03:08.910 --> 06:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
get us through this current bind I'm
 
06:03:11.190 --> 06:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting I'm thinking for instance
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
that titrating would be a skill in
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
biology Reading Core ice samples would
 
06:03:23.310 --> 06:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
be a skill but when you start talking
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
about environmental skills you're really
 
06:03:29.110 --> 06:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
talk talking about environmental
 
06:03:32.468 --> 06:03:32.478 align:start position:0%
activities or something like that when
 
06:03:34.390 --> 06:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
you say gardening and things of that
 
06:03:38.708 --> 06:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
sort and so you're displaying a a
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
conclusion that certain activities are
 
06:03:44.510 --> 06:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
better for the environment they may or
 
06:03:47.548 --> 06:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
they may not be in some cases there are
 
06:03:49.468 --> 06:03:49.478 align:start position:0%
agricultural examples that aren't
 
06:03:51.310 --> 06:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
particularly good for the environment in
 
06:03:54.390 --> 06:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
some people's opinion so I think we're
 
06:03:56.990 --> 06:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
kind of hung up here on what categories
 
06:04:00.468 --> 06:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
the these activities fall into rather
 
06:04:03.510 --> 06:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
than whether or not there's such a thing
 
06:04:05.948 --> 06:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
as an environmental
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
skill that's my my twoo sense
 
06:04:11.350 --> 06:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
worth thank
 
06:04:16.990 --> 06:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
you furthera you have your hand up
 
06:04:21.070 --> 06:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
then Corell I don't know she's your hand
 
06:04:23.628 --> 06:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
up no
 
06:04:26.350 --> 06:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
okay we have three hands up no wait
 
06:04:27.948 --> 06:04:27.958 align:start position:0%
minute yeah
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
yeah just following on what rep Ford was
 
06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
saying in that there are ways of doing
 
06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
things which I mean there are skills
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
that you learn for ways of doing things
 
06:04:47.788 --> 06:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
to not harm the environment to that well
 
06:04:49.708 --> 06:04:49.718 align:start position:0%
that you learn how the things that you
 
06:04:51.270 --> 06:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
do affect your
 
06:04:56.190 --> 06:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
environment how you handle the even home
 
06:04:58.468 --> 06:04:58.478 align:start position:0%
pesticide you and whatever how do you
 
06:05:01.430 --> 06:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
handle it those are skills how do you do
 
06:05:03.830 --> 06:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
things to keep it from running off into
 
06:05:06.310 --> 06:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
the water those are all skills that we
 
06:05:08.548 --> 06:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
would hope people would learn so that
 
06:05:10.750 --> 06:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
they don't do things like kill off the
 
06:05:14.468 --> 06:05:14.478 align:start position:0%
bees and all that kind of stuff and so I
 
06:05:17.430 --> 06:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
see these skills as still being
 
06:05:21.310 --> 06:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
important lifelong things because what
 
06:05:24.868 --> 06:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
we do as we go on as we interact with
 
06:05:27.708 --> 06:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
our environment does have an effect on
 
06:05:29.788 --> 06:05:29.798 align:start position:0%
it and I think we need to know how to do
 
06:05:34.468 --> 06:05:34.478 align:start position:0%
it in a sound and and responsible manner
 
06:05:37.868 --> 06:05:37.878 align:start position:0%
okay I if I can interrupt Eric is back
 
06:05:40.510 --> 06:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
on the attendee list if we could get him
 
06:05:44.190 --> 06:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
to come into the meeting to explain like
 
06:05:46.788 --> 06:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
the definitions that were being used for
 
06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation and
 
06:05:51.070 --> 06:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
environment and what they were looking
 
06:05:54.030 --> 06:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
at the CTE level for that sure we can
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
ask you in
 
06:05:56.000 --> 06:06:06.270 align:start position:0%
ask you in
thanks

06:06:06.270 --> 06:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:07.320 --> 06:06:07.330 align:start position:0%
welcome back Mr
 
06:06:07.330 --> 06:06:12.628 align:start position:0%
welcome back Mr
[Music]

06:06:12.628 --> 06:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:15.788 --> 06:06:15.798 align:start position:0%
Crower are you there Eric yes he is good
 
06:06:20.070 --> 06:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:23.628 --> 06:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay we're we're uh going over
 
06:06:27.548 --> 06:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
the last part of uh s sp4
 
06:06:30.270 --> 06:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
48 it's a part of the bill which deals
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the uh relative to environmental
 
06:06:35.548 --> 06:06:35.558 align:start position:0%
and outdoor
 
06:06:39.468 --> 06:06:39.478 align:start position:0%
education okay and uh what I've done is
 
06:06:43.948 --> 06:06:43.958 align:start position:0%
I've modified it in a in a possibility
 
06:06:46.110 --> 06:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
here rela to to
 
06:06:49.750 --> 06:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
environmental science and outdoor
 
06:06:52.670 --> 06:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
recreation and jumping down through all
 
06:06:54.910 --> 06:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
the findings getting into the criteria
 
06:06:56.670 --> 06:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
for inadequate education I think that's
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
the most important part of this
 
06:07:04.030 --> 06:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
bill um I've written that uh knowledge
 
06:07:06.230 --> 06:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
of biological physical and Earth
 
06:07:09.750 --> 06:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
Sciences including environmental science
 
06:07:11.390 --> 06:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
that investigates the complex
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
interaction of physical chemical and
 
06:07:15.708 --> 06:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
biological processes that take place on
 
06:07:18.350 --> 06:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
the earth to enable them to understand
 
06:07:20.350 --> 06:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
this is the kids and appreciate the
 
06:07:21.548 --> 06:07:21.558 align:start position:0%
world and the engineering and
 
06:07:23.310 --> 06:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic and geopolitical
 
06:07:27.830 --> 06:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
challenges around them then um the
 
06:07:30.910 --> 06:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
there's a a criteria for an adequate
 
06:07:32.750 --> 06:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
adequate education which is number six
 
06:07:34.750 --> 06:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
soundness sound wellness and
 
06:07:37.430 --> 06:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
environmental practices so we have
 
06:07:41.910 --> 06:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
environmental practices already in law
 
06:07:45.830 --> 06:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I put in it's in PR uh comma
 
06:07:49.150 --> 06:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
including outdoor recreation to enable
 
06:07:51.030 --> 06:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
them to enhance their own well-being as
 
06:07:54.110 --> 06:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
well as that of others uh that's already
 
06:07:56.030 --> 06:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
in law with the exception of in
 
06:07:57.990 --> 06:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
including outdoor Recreation which was
 
06:08:01.788 --> 06:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
put in the original Bill to assist to
 
06:08:04.670 --> 06:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
give um the
 
06:08:07.750 --> 06:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
centers uh the green light in terms of
 
06:08:09.830 --> 06:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
here is a criteria for an adequate
 
06:08:12.390 --> 06:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
education dealing with the outdoor
 
06:08:15.468 --> 06:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
recreation industry and moving folks
 
06:08:17.830 --> 06:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
forward with that those skills and that
 
06:08:21.830 --> 06:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge this the seventh area that um
 
06:08:24.750 --> 06:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
so that part remained the same uh part
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
seven says skills for lifelong Lear
 
06:08:30.590 --> 06:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
learning including interpersonal now the
 
06:08:33.548 --> 06:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
bill had Environmental Education skills
 
06:08:35.548 --> 06:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
I scratched out Environmental Education
 
06:08:38.468 --> 06:08:38.478 align:start position:0%
skills there and left it and technical
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
skills which is what we have to enable
 
06:08:44.350 --> 06:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
them to learn work communicate and part
 
06:08:46.830 --> 06:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
participate effectively in a changing
 
06:08:48.910 --> 06:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
society and
 
06:08:52.310 --> 06:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
environment so um those those are the
 
06:08:57.230 --> 06:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
changes that you know I've offered um I
 
06:08:59.468 --> 06:08:59.478 align:start position:0%
I I think one of the key components is
 
06:09:01.590 --> 06:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining outdoor
 
06:09:04.350 --> 06:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
recreation um and then speaking to
 
06:09:07.468 --> 06:09:07.478 align:start position:0%
environmental science which is spoken to
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the Roman three and then uh having
 
06:09:15.548 --> 06:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
skills to work and live within a
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
changing society and environment so uh
 
06:09:21.150 --> 06:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
I'll let representative Cornell she
 
06:09:24.110 --> 06:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
asked for you um to come in again on
 
06:09:27.350 --> 06:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
this and represent Cornell you can ask
 
06:09:31.868 --> 06:09:31.878 align:start position:0%
um um Eric uh well I think there were a
 
06:09:33.788 --> 06:09:33.798 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about what
 
06:09:36.628 --> 06:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
environmental skills were and what it
 
06:09:39.030 --> 06:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be and I I think we had a lot of
 
06:09:40.830 --> 06:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on that Monday in The
 
06:09:43.070 --> 06:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
Advisory Council about the competencies
 
06:09:47.030 --> 06:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
for outdoor use and um how things would
 
06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
be different depending on which CTE
 
06:09:51.670 --> 06:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
Center would be doing it and how it
 
06:09:54.270 --> 06:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
could be embedded into different CTE
 
06:09:57.590 --> 06:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
areas and um I I don't know about the
 
06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
crossing out of the Environmental
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
Education skills I thought that was
 
06:10:03.070 --> 06:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
something that we had talked about
 
06:10:05.190 --> 06:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
Monday that sounded important I just
 
06:10:07.868 --> 06:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your feedback on some of
 
06:10:11.708 --> 06:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
this Eric sure thanks uh and and part
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
parts of this are definitely in my world
 
06:10:16.510 --> 06:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
and and parts are I think belong to one
 
06:10:18.270 --> 06:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
of the other divisions uh at the doe
 
06:10:20.548 --> 06:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
that oversees the stem and I know when
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters drafts some of these
 
06:10:23.830 --> 06:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
things that includes a number of us at
 
06:10:26.628 --> 06:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
the doe uh but the outdoor recreation
 
06:10:28.670 --> 06:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
definitely um is part of our world and
 
06:10:31.468 --> 06:10:31.478 align:start position:0%
it was something that uh at the CTE
 
06:10:34.190 --> 06:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
centers we had already started talking
 
06:10:36.788 --> 06:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
about uh but uh I think representative
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
Cornelio hit it right on the head that
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
we just discussed the fact that outdoor
 
06:10:43.788 --> 06:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
recreation and its impact on the
 
06:10:46.270 --> 06:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
environment are very different depending
 
06:10:49.788 --> 06:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
on where you are in the state and uh we
 
06:10:51.948 --> 06:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
the examples we used were if a school
 
06:10:53.868 --> 06:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
was in the North Country for them
 
06:10:55.788 --> 06:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation might have a lot more
 
06:10:57.548 --> 06:10:57.558 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
06:11:00.270 --> 06:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
um managing the forest areas and hiking
 
06:11:03.190 --> 06:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
and fishing whereas outdoor recreation
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
in The Lakes Region might involve Power
 
06:11:08.110 --> 06:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
Sports and the impact of those Power
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
Sports on the environment would be very
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
different than people hiking and fishing
 
06:11:16.510 --> 06:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
up in the North Country uh and U but
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
making sure that all of them included
 
06:11:21.070 --> 06:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
whatever these students the programs
 
06:11:23.670 --> 06:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
were how they impacted the environment
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
so I think it is very important to make
 
06:11:27.548 --> 06:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
sure that keeping the phrasing up of uh
 
06:11:28.830 --> 06:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
impact on the environment or
 
06:11:31.430 --> 06:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Education uh is relevant
 
06:11:35.670 --> 06:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:38.430 --> 06:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
state thank you further further
 
06:11:41.948 --> 06:11:41.958 align:start position:0%
questions of Eric represent Mullen you
 
06:11:44.548 --> 06:11:44.558 align:start position:0%
have your hand up yeah I do uh it's more
 
06:11:49.310 --> 06:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
of a comment than uh a question Mr chair
 
06:11:52.868 --> 06:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh if you go back to the sections that
 
06:11:56.868 --> 06:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
you crossed out I believe what Eric is
 
06:11:59.948 --> 06:11:59.958 align:start position:0%
referencing uh Senator Waters started
 
06:12:01.990 --> 06:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
with Roman numeral
 
06:12:04.948 --> 06:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
5 therefore it is in the public interest
 
06:12:07.548 --> 06:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
to provide environmental and outdoor
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
recreation education for New Hampshire
 
06:12:13.390 --> 06:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
students where it starts there it goes
 
06:12:16.830 --> 06:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
into the next statement which says
 
06:12:19.230 --> 06:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
environmental lit literacy requires
 
06:12:21.270 --> 06:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
having an understanding of the natural
 
06:12:24.110 --> 06:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
world and the capacity to interpret
 
06:12:26.948 --> 06:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
environmental systems which is what Eric
 
06:12:29.948 --> 06:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
is talking about uh and then it goes on
 
06:12:32.510 --> 06:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
to define environmental
 
06:12:35.468 --> 06:12:35.478 align:start position:0%
literacy as uh achieved through
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
Environmental Education and outdoor
 
06:12:40.788 --> 06:12:40.798 align:start position:0%

06:12:51.270 --> 06:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
reading it now outdoor recreation
 
06:12:53.708 --> 06:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
education includes instruction in
 
06:12:56.548 --> 06:12:56.558 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreational activities and
 
06:12:59.310 --> 06:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
preparation for participation in the
 
06:13:01.750 --> 06:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation
 
06:13:06.310 --> 06:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
industry um that language to me does not
 
06:13:08.510 --> 06:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
look like feel-good language that
 
06:13:11.468 --> 06:13:11.478 align:start position:0%
language to me sounds like essential
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
language because I think it puts the
 
06:13:18.548 --> 06:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
importance of recreation and knowledge
 
06:13:21.390 --> 06:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
of its impact on the
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
environment front and center so I would
 
06:13:27.670 --> 06:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
suggest that we might want to think
 
06:13:32.030 --> 06:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
about um reinstating perhaps some of
 
06:13:34.788 --> 06:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
that language into whatever it is that
 
06:13:37.468 --> 06:13:37.478 align:start position:0%
we move forward with because I think it
 
06:13:39.548 --> 06:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
does put parameters around what those
 
06:13:39.558 --> 06:13:42.230 align:start position:0%
does put parameters around what those
definitions

06:13:42.230 --> 06:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:48.628 --> 06:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:53.670 --> 06:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.548 --> 06:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
um especially in New Hampshire I think
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely vital and important
 
06:13:59.230 --> 06:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
that that
 
06:14:02.150 --> 06:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
students uh are exposed to the
 
06:14:04.750 --> 06:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
information around whatever how whatever
 
06:14:06.830 --> 06:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing will be impacting the
 
06:14:08.430 --> 06:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
environment as moving forward in their
 
06:14:10.628 --> 06:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
careers and and making sure that
 
06:14:14.150 --> 06:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
whatever language you put in as um as
 
06:14:16.270 --> 06:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
required education for students includes
 
06:14:24.948 --> 06:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:28.708 --> 06:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
form repres Hopson yeah I think I think
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
I understand a little bit better um what
 
06:14:34.948 --> 06:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
rep Mullen and and Mr prow worth were
 
06:14:38.468 --> 06:14:38.478 align:start position:0%
talking about as far as um that being
 
06:14:42.390 --> 06:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
the the core knowledge content and maybe
 
06:14:44.910 --> 06:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
that does need to be in a separate place
 
06:14:50.548 --> 06:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
but uh as far as under Roman numeral 7
 
06:14:53.150 --> 06:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Education skills that
 
06:14:54.708 --> 06:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
to me seems
 
06:14:57.990 --> 06:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
misplaced what this paragraph is talking
 
06:15:01.750 --> 06:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
about is lifelong skills in other words
 
06:15:03.910 --> 06:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
how do you communicate your message it's
 
06:15:05.708 --> 06:15:05.718 align:start position:0%
more of the
 
06:15:08.788 --> 06:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
um uh be being able to communicate being
 
06:15:10.910 --> 06:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
able to get your thought across it's
 
06:15:12.990 --> 06:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
more of a of
 
06:15:17.708 --> 06:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
a obviously I didn't pass that
 
06:15:20.750 --> 06:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
class but
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
um the the fundamentals not necessarily
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
the core knowledge does does that make
 
06:15:29.510 --> 06:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
sense technological
 
06:15:33.230 --> 06:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
skills um to participate effectivly
 
06:15:35.350 --> 06:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
effectively in changing
 
06:15:38.750 --> 06:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
Society um those are all the day-to-day
 
06:15:42.030 --> 06:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
skills whereas the core environment is
 
06:15:45.830 --> 06:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
the core knowledge am I making
 
06:15:49.070 --> 06:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
sense but the bill is titled relevant to
 
06:15:52.868 --> 06:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
environmental and outdoor recreation so
 
06:15:55.750 --> 06:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
those skills are relevant to what the
 
06:15:55.760 --> 06:15:57.270 align:start position:0%
those skills are relevant to what the
bill

06:15:57.270 --> 06:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:16:01.868 --> 06:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
is but in that particular paragraph you
 
06:16:04.430 --> 06:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
would use you could take that paragraph
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
out and put it into any content
 
06:16:11.310 --> 06:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge into any content
 
06:16:13.788 --> 06:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
area do you know what I'm saying those
 
06:16:17.350 --> 06:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
those particular skills so anyway that's
 
06:16:20.310 --> 06:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
thought further questions
 
06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:36.910 --> 06:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:39.948 --> 06:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
you can't hear you Alicia I I know I
 
06:16:41.628 --> 06:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the little arrow ex kep
 
06:16:43.548 --> 06:16:43.558 align:start position:0%
giving me a hand and not an arrow so I
 
06:16:43.558 --> 06:16:45.070 align:start position:0%
giving me a hand and not an arrow so I
couldn't

06:16:45.070 --> 06:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
06:16:50.468 --> 06:16:50.478 align:start position:0%
unmute there you go you got it so I just
 
06:16:53.310 --> 06:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
my I like the environmental skills but
 
06:16:55.788 --> 06:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Education skills I
 
06:16:57.708 --> 06:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
don't know that that makes sense I would
 
06:17:00.510 --> 06:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
take the education word out of that but
 
06:17:02.750 --> 06:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
leave environmental skills in and I the
 
06:17:05.750 --> 06:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
reason I okay so the reason I keep
 
06:17:08.548 --> 06:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
pushing this is because I have seen too
 
06:17:11.708 --> 06:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
many times when people don't have those
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
environmental skills they don't
 
06:17:16.868 --> 06:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
understand how what they do affects the
 
06:17:19.190 --> 06:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
world the environment and
 
06:17:22.750 --> 06:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
everything and and that is a lifelong
 
06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
learning thing is how to make sure you
 
06:17:25.600 --> 06:17:26.948 align:start position:0%
learning thing is how to make sure you
don't

06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:17:30.190 --> 06:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
dump the you know oh I I have a garden
 
06:17:31.910 --> 06:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I want to keep the bugs off so I'm
 
06:17:33.468 --> 06:17:33.478 align:start position:0%
going to spray this stuff that's then
 
06:17:38.230 --> 06:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
going to wash down into my water source
 
06:17:41.350 --> 06:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
or it's or put too much on or not cover
 
06:17:43.230 --> 06:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
myself and then I'm going to be exposed
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
to it myself and have problems I think
 
06:17:49.628 --> 06:17:49.638 align:start position:0%
that there are skills that just normal
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
people as adults need to not only know
 
06:17:56.788 --> 06:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
but know how to keep up with know how to
 
06:18:00.510 --> 06:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
you know as as technology Etc changes I
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
think people need to
 
06:18:05.150 --> 06:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
know and know how to learn those things
 
06:18:07.510 --> 06:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
so I think environmental skills are
 
06:18:10.708 --> 06:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
important for everybody who interacts
 
06:18:12.548 --> 06:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
with the environment which is just about
 
06:18:15.350 --> 06:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
everybody in One Way or Another so I
 
06:18:18.468 --> 06:18:18.478 align:start position:0%
just see that as following into this
 
06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
whole section I would take the education
 
06:18:23.390 --> 06:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
word out but environmental skills as
 
06:18:26.230 --> 06:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
something that it's a lifelong learning
 
06:18:29.230 --> 06:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
kind of thing is how do these things
 
06:18:32.590 --> 06:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm doing affect my
 
06:18:34.990 --> 06:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
environment you know I think it's I
 
06:18:37.548 --> 06:18:37.558 align:start position:0%
think it's important uh Alicia I got a
 
06:18:39.548 --> 06:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
question for you what is the difference
 
06:18:42.430 --> 06:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
between environmental skills and
 
06:18:44.910 --> 06:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
environmental practices which is already
 
06:18:44.920 --> 06:18:46.590 align:start position:0%
environmental practices which is already
in

06:18:46.590 --> 06:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:18:49.190 --> 06:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
law because this section we're talking
 
06:18:51.990 --> 06:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
about lifelong learning and so lifelong
 
06:18:54.510 --> 06:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
learning would be continuing
 
06:18:56.350 --> 06:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
environmental skills
 
06:18:58.788 --> 06:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
as we go along as things change as
 
06:18:58.798 --> 06:19:04.310 align:start position:0%
as we go along as things change as
Technologies

06:19:04.310 --> 06:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:07.430 --> 06:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
change so I think it's
 
06:19:10.230 --> 06:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
just you know we've put environmental
 
06:19:12.910 --> 06:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
science in there that's when what we're
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
studying um environmental where was it
 
06:19:19.750 --> 06:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
it shows up because it's in this whole
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
section environmental practices sound
 
06:19:26.030 --> 06:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
environmental practices this is good but
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
now we're going on to lifelong learning
 
06:19:30.990 --> 06:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
so as part of our lifelong learning we
 
06:19:33.150 --> 06:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
need to
 
06:19:37.390 --> 06:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
um improve and continue learning about
 
06:19:39.830 --> 06:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
improving our environmental skills and
 
06:19:43.270 --> 06:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
learning what new things as we get
 
06:19:45.910 --> 06:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
new whatever
 
06:19:48.590 --> 06:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
Technologies pesticide whatever it is
 
06:19:51.310 --> 06:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
that we're working with um as we learn
 
06:19:53.670 --> 06:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
new ways of of the appropriate way of
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
thinning forests or what two not to cut
 
06:19:59.390 --> 06:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
or whatever that's a lifelong learning
 
06:20:02.548 --> 06:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
thing so I think they're three steps of
 
06:20:07.110 --> 06:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:13.628 --> 06:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:17.708 --> 06:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
discussion looks like we're there we got
 
06:20:20.628 --> 06:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
several more bills
 
06:20:23.948 --> 06:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
folks okay so with that we'll we'll
 
06:20:26.390 --> 06:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
leave this one and put some amendments
 
06:20:29.910 --> 06:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
together and we'll move move those
 
06:20:35.990 --> 06:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:36.000 --> 06:20:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
bill

06:20:40.190 --> 06:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:50.510 --> 06:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:54.628 --> 06:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:54.638 --> 06:20:58.270 align:start position:0%
 
135

06:20:58.270 --> 06:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:03.670 --> 06:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
Rick yeah yeah on 135 um uh I talk quite
 
06:21:06.390 --> 06:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
a bit during the um during the hearing
 
06:21:10.070 --> 06:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
on um two of the Amendments that um that
 
06:21:12.948 --> 06:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
that that I'm going to offer uh next
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
week uh Amendment 1012 which um which
 
06:21:21.110 --> 06:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
Returns the um fiscal capacity disparity
 
06:21:24.628 --> 06:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
Equitable Grant to which we have in
 
06:21:28.990 --> 06:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
fy21 stores that for fy22 and 23 it's
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
about a a $49 million um uh uh grant
 
06:21:37.670 --> 06:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
that uh that goes to uh districts across
 
06:21:40.270 --> 06:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
the state based on their um uh equalized
 
06:21:44.150 --> 06:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
property value per pupil and um and
 
06:21:47.110 --> 06:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
distribute State money in a in a re
 
06:21:49.030 --> 06:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
really the places where it's needed most
 
06:21:51.510 --> 06:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to this sort of flat 50 Cent
 
06:21:54.270 --> 06:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
um um you know tax reduction to
 
06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
everybody whether or not you're tax
 
06:21:58.708 --> 06:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
rates $40 per thousand or $4 per
 
06:22:01.270 --> 06:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
thousand so it it it puts the money
 
06:22:03.230 --> 06:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
where it makes the most difference the
 
06:22:04.868 --> 06:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
other amendment that I'm going to offer
 
06:22:06.270 --> 06:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
is is
 
06:22:10.548 --> 06:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
1020h that um um does the same thing
 
06:22:12.350 --> 06:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's an it's an equitable Grant it's
 
06:22:16.628 --> 06:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
about an 11 million uh thing and it's um
 
06:22:19.750 --> 06:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's um based on free and reduced price
 
06:22:23.110 --> 06:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
lunch it's also something we did in a
 
06:22:26.948 --> 06:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
very strong bipartisan way uh for
 
06:22:31.628 --> 06:22:31.638 align:start position:0%
fy21 um last session and um and extends
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
that to fy22 and FY 23 it um uh uh both
 
06:22:41.548 --> 06:22:41.558 align:start position:0%
both amendments are written so that you
 
06:22:43.868 --> 06:22:43.878 align:start position:0%
know if one passes and the other doesn't
 
06:22:46.708 --> 06:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
pass then the sunset provision that's in
 
06:22:50.350 --> 06:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
current law applies um if they both pass
 
06:22:53.468 --> 06:22:53.478 align:start position:0%
then the sunsets are extended to the uh
 
06:22:56.230 --> 06:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
to the end of 20 well 6:30
 
06:22:59.868 --> 06:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
uh 2023 so they're pushed out a year um
 
06:23:03.590 --> 06:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
I am going to amend or make new versions
 
06:23:06.230 --> 06:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
of these amendments because um we've had
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
some additional um uh information from
 
06:23:14.030 --> 06:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
the from the the US um Department of of
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
Education with respect to the extension
 
06:23:20.310 --> 06:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
of the free and reduced price lunch um
 
06:23:22.990 --> 06:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
waivers so we're going to have to rely
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
on um on fy20 um uh uh uh free and
 
06:23:31.628 --> 06:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch headcounts the adma
 
06:23:33.628 --> 06:23:33.638 align:start position:0%
for both the adequate adequacy
 
06:23:36.030 --> 06:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
calculation as well as the um Equitable
 
06:23:39.990 --> 06:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
Grant calculation uh going into fy22 and
 
06:23:44.430 --> 06:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
FY 23 so we'll be amending um those two
 
06:23:47.628 --> 06:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
changing those two amendments um to uh
 
06:23:50.948 --> 06:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
to refle reflect that Dave Dave can you
 
06:23:55.990 --> 06:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
hear me Dave can you hear me yeah um did
 
06:23:59.468 --> 06:23:59.478 align:start position:0%
uh the feds now are saying yeah the
 
06:24:01.110 --> 06:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
06:24:05.708 --> 06:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
2020 I thought we um in uh
 
06:24:09.390 --> 06:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 or sent over an amendment where we
 
06:24:10.868 --> 06:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
went to
 
06:24:10.878 --> 06:24:13.430 align:start position:0%
went to
fy18

06:24:13.430 --> 06:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
fy18
 
06:24:17.590 --> 06:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
19 1819 where we'd have the option
 
06:24:21.788 --> 06:24:21.798 align:start position:0%
taking the greater of fy19 I think it
 
06:24:26.708 --> 06:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
was 19 and or the current so so it's not
 
06:24:29.430 --> 06:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
fy9 you're talking about the fall of of
 
06:24:31.590 --> 06:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
so the October
 
06:24:36.350 --> 06:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
2019 yeah enrollment is the fy20
 
06:24:39.070 --> 06:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment collected during the fall of
 
06:24:41.990 --> 06:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
2019 I think either either we went there
 
06:24:45.070 --> 06:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
was another amendment which I I bought
 
06:24:47.670 --> 06:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
from Kaitlyn yeah so that's the third
 
06:24:50.230 --> 06:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
grade reading Amendment that's Title One
 
06:24:52.868 --> 06:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yes and I'm absolutely in
 
06:24:55.868 --> 06:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
support of that one too and and uh and
 
06:25:00.548 --> 06:25:00.558 align:start position:0%
that one would um would also need to to
 
06:25:05.230 --> 06:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
apply to um um you know it would also
 
06:25:08.990 --> 06:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
need to be changed so that it uses the
 
06:25:11.868 --> 06:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
it it's already good at using the
 
06:25:17.868 --> 06:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
2018 um or the sorry the U spring of 20
 
06:25:19.390 --> 06:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm saying it the wrong way the
 
06:25:23.510 --> 06:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
spring of 2019 numbers for the free for
 
06:25:25.830 --> 06:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
the third grade reading
 
06:25:29.110 --> 06:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
performance but but it also the way the
 
06:25:31.430 --> 06:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
amendment's written is it's a replace
 
06:25:33.070 --> 06:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
you know the entire bill with the new
 
06:25:35.990 --> 06:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing so it also needs to reflect the
 
06:25:39.868 --> 06:25:39.878 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch uh for fy22
 
06:25:46.110 --> 06:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
and FY 23 based on the fy20 data um uh I
 
06:25:47.510 --> 06:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm you
 
06:25:50.390 --> 06:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm gonna I'm GNA take on all three
 
06:25:52.788 --> 06:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
of these amendments I know the the one
 
06:25:54.430 --> 06:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
for third grade reading has your name on
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
it but I'm happy
 
06:25:59.910 --> 06:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
that one I I the day we discussed it
 
06:26:03.390 --> 06:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
here in committee that was weeks ago
 
06:26:06.948 --> 06:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
yeah that was the week prior to uh the
 
06:26:09.948 --> 06:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
finance division two taking action or no
 
06:26:12.070 --> 06:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
not F they' already they were taking
 
06:26:15.750 --> 06:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
action and it was next week that Finance
 
06:26:17.430 --> 06:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
acted upon
 
06:26:21.990 --> 06:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 I believe they Incorporated the that
 
06:26:22.000 --> 06:26:23.070 align:start position:0%
hb2 I believe they Incorporated the that
uh

06:26:23.070 --> 06:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:26:26.270 --> 06:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh Karen called me up umberger
 
06:26:28.910 --> 06:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
represented umberger and asked for a
 
06:26:32.030 --> 06:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
copy but that evening at 5 o'l I was
 
06:26:33.910 --> 06:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
downstairs in the
 
06:26:37.030 --> 06:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
LBA and that was emailed to her and I
 
06:26:39.548 --> 06:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
believe they acted upon that in their
 
06:26:42.110 --> 06:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
discussions the following week I don't
 
06:26:44.788 --> 06:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
think they did Rick because we we we we
 
06:26:46.430 --> 06:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
fought that on the
 
06:26:49.150 --> 06:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
floor to get these amendments
 
06:26:51.510 --> 06:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
in I'll have to check that because I
 
06:26:52.990 --> 06:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
thought I was under the understanding
 
06:26:56.548 --> 06:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
that that placed in because uh you
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
know so nothing in Senate Bill 135 or
 
06:27:02.990 --> 06:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
the two or the three amendments that you
 
06:27:05.390 --> 06:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
and I have talked about made their way
 
06:27:08.948 --> 06:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
into hb2 it wasn't in I think they made
 
06:27:10.510 --> 06:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
their own Amendment they took the
 
06:27:12.910 --> 06:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
language and put it in another amendment
 
06:27:14.708 --> 06:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
yeah but that that that policy didn't
 
06:27:16.868 --> 06:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
make its way into hp2 but let's double
 
06:27:22.948 --> 06:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
check that yeah yeah do that yeah um uh
 
06:27:24.788 --> 06:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
but you know at the at the end of the
 
06:27:24.798 --> 06:27:25.788 align:start position:0%
but you know at the at the end of the
day

06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:27:29.270 --> 06:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
these three amendments um uh have a
 
06:27:33.830 --> 06:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
price tag of um of of about 60 million a
 
06:27:37.468 --> 06:27:37.478 align:start position:0%
year so $120 million for the
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
banum it they they they deploy State
 
06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
funds where they're needed most both in
 
06:27:47.310 --> 06:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
if to districts with high incidences of
 
06:27:50.468 --> 06:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
poverty and to districts with with lower
 
06:27:53.990 --> 06:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh property valuation per pupil and um
 
06:27:57.670 --> 06:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
and and basically you know uses the um
 
06:27:59.510 --> 06:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the money which would be would
 
06:28:02.468 --> 06:28:02.478 align:start position:0%
instead be you know um done on a sort of
 
06:28:05.788 --> 06:28:05.798 align:start position:0%
flat basis everybody gets the the same
 
06:28:11.230 --> 06:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
thing and um um uh to uh to pay for it
 
06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
so so the um you know uh anyway the the
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
amendments are going to have to
 
06:28:20.750 --> 06:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
obviously be updated based on what we
 
06:28:22.310 --> 06:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
just talked about from what we saw a few
 
06:28:25.070 --> 06:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and um and I think it you know
 
06:28:27.548 --> 06:28:27.558 align:start position:0%
know we we had discussion earlier this
 
06:28:29.830 --> 06:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
this um you know at the beginning of the
 
06:28:32.230 --> 06:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
session on on Rick on your bill House
 
06:28:35.310 --> 06:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 608 which you know I think had a
 
06:28:38.030 --> 06:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
lot of good intentions to it obviously
 
06:28:41.030 --> 06:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
um a lot more um you know spreadsheet
 
06:28:43.628 --> 06:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
work and modeling needs to be done but
 
06:28:45.070 --> 06:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
but these three amendments certainly
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
push things in the direction of um of
 
06:28:49.910 --> 06:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know that that I think house school
 
06:28:52.670 --> 06:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
608 you know would take it and you'd see
 
06:28:55.390 --> 06:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
you'd see you know Berlin seeing
 
06:28:59.590 --> 06:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
potential uh tax rate reduction of over
 
06:29:01.548 --> 06:29:01.558 align:start position:0%
$3.50 that's a
 
06:29:04.788 --> 06:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
9% uh tax reduction there Charlestown
 
06:29:06.270 --> 06:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
would see almost a
 
06:29:10.468 --> 06:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
$3 uh tax reduction at 7 and a half%
 
06:29:13.868 --> 06:29:13.878 align:start position:0%
Claremont 10% reduction and you know
 
06:29:16.230 --> 06:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
Derry would even see a dollar you know
 
06:29:19.830 --> 06:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
reduction on its um on its tax rate so
 
06:29:22.350 --> 06:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
um you know so it really and you know
 
06:29:24.350 --> 06:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
and Derry just joined the conval suit I
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
think I just heard that last night yes
 
06:29:31.310 --> 06:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
they did yeah so um so you know
 
06:29:33.548 --> 06:29:33.558 align:start position:0%
I you know I know it's been a long day
 
06:29:35.590 --> 06:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
today so I I don't want to debate all
 
06:29:37.270 --> 06:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
these things over again we've got next
 
06:29:40.310 --> 06:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
week where where where we'll um bring
 
06:29:42.670 --> 06:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
them up again but I'm I'm certainly
 
06:29:45.830 --> 06:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions uh Dave uh
 
06:29:48.788 --> 06:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
when you come next week can we receive
 
06:29:52.430 --> 06:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
beforehand do you have a a uh a
 
06:29:55.510 --> 06:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
calculator there which would show
 
06:29:58.390 --> 06:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
the information relative to all the
 
06:30:00.948 --> 06:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
towns within the state yeah I've got a
 
06:30:03.030 --> 06:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
I've got a what in fact what I what I
 
06:30:05.708 --> 06:30:05.718 align:start position:0%
sent to the to the full committee a few
 
06:30:08.750 --> 06:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
weeks ago were with those two amendments
 
06:30:12.070 --> 06:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
as well as a um a town Bytown
 
06:30:15.590 --> 06:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet uh I will send those again
 
06:30:17.948 --> 06:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh with the updated you know amendments
 
06:30:21.150 --> 06:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
the the numbers won't won't change just
 
06:30:23.830 --> 06:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
the um uh you know it's just the ex use
 
06:30:26.548 --> 06:30:26.558 align:start position:0%
of the pre-introduced price lunch adma
 
06:30:31.510 --> 06:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
count um um for both for both years and
 
06:30:35.510 --> 06:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh but I'll also include the um you know
 
06:30:37.910 --> 06:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
I've updated the spreadsheet to also
 
06:30:40.270 --> 06:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
show you know the potential tax rate
 
06:30:42.590 --> 06:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
impact based on the Dr that's why I had
 
06:30:46.030 --> 06:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
the Dr spreadsheet open uh this morning
 
06:30:47.670 --> 06:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll make sure I'll make sure
 
06:30:49.990 --> 06:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee gets that by
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
Tuesday next week if I can um if I can
 
06:30:56.070 --> 06:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
I'll get this over to Mary and
 
06:30:58.150 --> 06:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow they should be straightforward
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
changes and uh it yeah when you do those
 
06:31:07.948 --> 06:31:07.958 align:start position:0%
calculations can you put average um the
 
06:31:10.510 --> 06:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
average Actual taxes that people pay
 
06:31:13.910 --> 06:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
because tax rate when you have different
 
06:31:17.350 --> 06:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
tax valuation property valuation you
 
06:31:19.110 --> 06:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
know you're going to have if you have a
 
06:31:21.750 --> 06:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
low property valuation you need a much
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
higher rate to pay the same amount and
 
06:31:26.548 --> 06:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
so what we really want to compare is
 
06:31:29.310 --> 06:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
what people are actually paying because
 
06:31:32.070 --> 06:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
like our T values down here are
 
06:31:34.270 --> 06:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
ridiculously high that doesn't mean that
 
06:31:36.590 --> 06:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
the people who live here have suddenly
 
06:31:39.110 --> 06:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
started making lots more money or have
 
06:31:40.948 --> 06:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
lots more money to pay it just means
 
06:31:42.910 --> 06:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
that right at the moment our properties
 
06:31:45.270 --> 06:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
are valued really high hasn't changed
 
06:31:46.990 --> 06:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
our properties even it's the same
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
property it was you know five years ago
 
06:31:51.948 --> 06:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
it's just suddenly worth more so then
 
06:31:55.310 --> 06:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
our tax rate is less to to make the same
 
06:31:57.788 --> 06:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
amount but when but so the question is
 
06:31:59.788 --> 06:31:59.798 align:start position:0%
how much are people actually paying
 
06:32:02.030 --> 06:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to see well it
 
06:32:04.628 --> 06:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
depends on how how how you know valuable
 
06:32:08.388 --> 06:32:08.398 align:start position:0%
your your your property is but the way
 
06:32:11.590 --> 06:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
the way and and you know and um your
 
06:32:15.110 --> 06:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
your um your constituent Sean Jasper um
 
06:32:17.628 --> 06:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
explained this to me um a bunch of years
 
06:32:20.750 --> 06:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
ago and the way you compare rates across
 
06:32:23.628 --> 06:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
or between municipalities is by looking
 
06:32:25.310 --> 06:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
at the equalized
 
06:32:29.190 --> 06:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
um um rate uh because that that factors
 
06:32:32.788 --> 06:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
in the the the local differences and
 
06:32:36.270 --> 06:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
valuation or an assessment so yeah so
 
06:32:38.110 --> 06:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the the rates that
 
06:32:40.030 --> 06:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
that I use for comparison purposes are
 
06:32:42.670 --> 06:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
equalized right but for for me if you
 
06:32:45.990 --> 06:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
can in addition to that add in the the
 
06:32:48.830 --> 06:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
average amount of taxes paid that will
 
06:32:51.628 --> 06:32:51.638 align:start position:0%
help me see better because my 200y old
 
06:32:54.310 --> 06:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
farmhouse we were just looking is worth
 
06:32:56.270 --> 06:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
that quantities of money at the moment
 
06:32:58.510 --> 06:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's still a 200y old farmhouse it's
 
06:33:00.270 --> 06:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
just because it happens to exist in
 
06:33:02.948 --> 06:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
Hudson which happens to be where people
 
06:33:04.590 --> 06:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
want to move at the moment doesn't
 
06:33:06.590 --> 06:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
change our income doesn't change our
 
06:33:09.310 --> 06:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
house and so that's all I'm saying is so
 
06:33:11.830 --> 06:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
where do you want me to get that data
 
06:33:16.868 --> 06:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
well if you take the average tax rate
 
06:33:19.190 --> 06:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
times the average property value that
 
06:33:21.388 --> 06:33:21.398 align:start position:0%
should give you the average amount paid
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
right how do I get the average property
 
06:33:26.030 --> 06:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
value well that's one of the things that
 
06:33:28.270 --> 06:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
you had here was no that's Total
 
06:33:31.430 --> 06:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
Property valuation oh so you don't know
 
06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
what the average is you just know the
 
06:33:37.948 --> 06:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
total yeah so so th this this data
 
06:33:40.868 --> 06:33:40.878 align:start position:0%
actually can be mined I mean I do I do
 
06:33:42.948 --> 06:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
have access to the data through the
 
06:33:45.510 --> 06:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
Mosaic um Rick remember we we talked
 
06:33:47.708 --> 06:33:47.718 align:start position:0%
about this on the school funding
 
06:33:49.548 --> 06:33:49.558 align:start position:0%
commission the Mosaic
 
06:33:53.708 --> 06:33:53.718 align:start position:0%
data has has every piece of um taxable
 
06:33:55.548 --> 06:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
property in the state in New Hampshire
 
06:33:59.190 --> 06:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
current valuation um um doesn't have tax
 
06:34:02.190 --> 06:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
rate data but you can you can use that
 
06:34:04.830 --> 06:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
that spreadsheets got 700,000 records on
 
06:34:07.628 --> 06:34:07.638 align:start position:0%
it and you can use the Dr spreadsheet
 
06:34:10.350 --> 06:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
with the with the tax rates and you can
 
06:34:14.270 --> 06:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
actually you that could be calculated so
 
06:34:18.510 --> 06:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
what I what I can do um Alicia is is
 
06:34:18.520 --> 06:34:20.030 align:start position:0%
what I what I can do um Alicia is is
probably

06:34:20.030 --> 06:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
probably
 
06:34:23.468 --> 06:34:23.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:27.590 --> 06:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
town I can probably calculate like the
 
06:34:30.350 --> 06:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
number you know the the the tax impact
 
06:34:34.430 --> 06:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
of let's say homes valued um less than
 
06:34:38.788 --> 06:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
$300,000 between 300,000 and 500,000
 
06:34:41.310 --> 06:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
500,000 to a million and a million and
 
06:34:44.030 --> 06:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
up or something like that you know I I
 
06:34:46.708 --> 06:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
I'll um I'll see if I can do it without
 
06:34:50.190 --> 06:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
without my um computer CR yeah don't do
 
06:34:52.948 --> 06:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
vast quantities of time and whatever but
 
06:34:55.350 --> 06:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
that helps me see it better when I look
 
06:34:57.788 --> 06:34:57.798 align:start position:0%
at it to say oh these guys are paying
 
06:34:59.910 --> 06:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
$5,000 a year and these guys are paying
 
06:35:04.150 --> 06:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
$2,000 a year that to me makes a it's
 
06:35:06.270 --> 06:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
much more easy for me to understand
 
06:35:08.190 --> 06:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
thank yeah yeah let me let me see what I
 
06:35:12.230 --> 06:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
can do on on that there's um uh but I I
 
06:35:13.990 --> 06:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
think I think what you're suggesting
 
06:35:18.150 --> 06:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
though is is a good way where we I me
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
we've got access to these new you know
 
06:35:23.150 --> 06:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
this these new tools and this data that
 
06:35:26.110 --> 06:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
the Dr has started collecting and we can
 
06:35:29.150 --> 06:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
actually use that when when when you
 
06:35:33.270 --> 06:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
know to help us analyze policy like this
 
06:35:35.788 --> 06:35:35.798 align:start position:0%
what does it do yeah thank you very
 
06:35:39.190 --> 06:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
much rep you have a question just to
 
06:35:42.468 --> 06:35:42.478 align:start position:0%
follow up on uh represent
 
06:35:45.590 --> 06:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
leases one way to do it is look up each
 
06:35:48.350 --> 06:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
town and you'll see the average value of
 
06:35:51.430 --> 06:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
a house in the towns and for example in
 
06:35:53.670 --> 06:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Hudson and
 
06:35:57.590 --> 06:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
litfield for example a $300,000 house
 
06:35:58.990 --> 06:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
06:36:02.030 --> 06:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
$150,000 house up in Berlin so if the
 
06:36:03.990 --> 06:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
tax rate in Berlin is twice what
 
06:36:06.788 --> 06:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
litfield is they're paying the same
 
06:36:09.590 --> 06:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
amount of taxes and that's what Alicia
 
06:36:12.430 --> 06:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
is trying to get to
 
06:36:15.190 --> 06:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
so look at the equalized valuation but
 
06:36:17.708 --> 06:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean anything the property
 
06:36:20.708 --> 06:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
values mean something and if you look at
 
06:36:23.590 --> 06:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
each individual town they tell you what
 
06:36:25.670 --> 06:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
the average
 
06:36:28.868 --> 06:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
property is in that town and up north is
 
06:36:31.310 --> 06:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
half of what it is in the South so is
 
06:36:31.320 --> 06:36:32.548 align:start position:0%
half of what it is in the South so is
the

06:36:32.548 --> 06:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:36:35.190 --> 06:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
income that doesn't matter resources
 
06:36:37.750 --> 06:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
06:36:41.830 --> 06:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
matter uh Dave uh the LBA put out a a
 
06:36:44.350 --> 06:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
sheet which I I have right here you may
 
06:36:47.230 --> 06:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
have it's stated
 
06:36:50.750 --> 06:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
42721 it's estimated total education Aid
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
the House pass budget preliminary
 
06:36:55.310 --> 06:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
estimates for discussion purpos only but
 
06:36:58.070 --> 06:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
it was put out by the LBA do you have
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
anything that's been put out by the LBA
 
06:37:05.388 --> 06:37:05.398 align:start position:0%
uh by what you're presenting um this
 
06:37:07.990 --> 06:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
this goes down basically by every
 
06:37:10.270 --> 06:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
municipality showing what they're
 
06:37:15.270 --> 06:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
getting for fy22 and FY uh 23 compared
 
06:37:18.110 --> 06:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
to the current year compared to
 
06:37:22.230 --> 06:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
fy21 well for example fy22 is compared
 
06:37:25.310 --> 06:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
to this the the current
 
06:37:30.590 --> 06:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
law and and then um FY 23 as passed by
 
06:37:34.468 --> 06:37:34.478 align:start position:0%
house is compared to the current law and
 
06:37:36.030 --> 06:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
what what what does it show I'm not
 
06:37:37.468 --> 06:37:37.478 align:start position:0%
looking at what you're looking at right
 
06:37:39.788 --> 06:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
now what does it show for
 
06:37:43.388 --> 06:37:43.398 align:start position:0%
fy22 um compared to fy21 current

SB
 
06:38:41.388 --> 06:38:41.398 align:start position:0%
135 uh is there any further discussion
 
06:38:44.190 --> 06:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
on 135 at this
 
06:38:47.350 --> 06:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
time yes representative ma uh thank you
 
06:38:49.868 --> 06:38:49.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chair on these amendments uh
 
06:38:52.990 --> 06:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
oftentimes during this past five months
 
06:38:55.230 --> 06:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh we've got some of amendments like uh
 
06:38:57.990 --> 06:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
1 minute to 9:00 or that type of thing
 
06:39:00.548 --> 06:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
so whether they coming from whoever uh
 
06:39:04.548 --> 06:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
you or or represent luno whoever uh and
 
06:39:06.510 --> 06:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
I know they're busy at ol but if we
 
06:39:09.110 --> 06:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
could get these like before the before
 
06:39:10.868 --> 06:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
one minute to nine it would be really
 
06:39:13.788 --> 06:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
good that's just well that that was the
 
06:39:15.868 --> 06:39:15.878 align:start position:0%
purpose of having a work session today
 
06:39:17.628 --> 06:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
so we could you know just have a
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
discussion all these bills and then you
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
know put some amendments out get it
 
06:39:25.468 --> 06:39:25.478 align:start position:0%
going so we can get those in the hands
 
06:39:27.510 --> 06:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
of folks prior to you know walking in
 
06:39:29.430 --> 06:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
and find them it's that makes it
 
06:39:32.350 --> 06:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
difficult for everybody um so let's
 
06:39:34.030 --> 06:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully try and get them out as soon
 
06:39:36.430 --> 06:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
as folks
 
06:39:40.750 --> 06:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
can alrighty um so is there no more
 
06:39:43.310 --> 06:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on SB
 
06:39:46.110 --> 06:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
135 and that leaves the only remaining
 
06:39:50.310 --> 06:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
we did 44 147 148 I mean and now we have
 
06:39:52.948 --> 06:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
just the one bill
 
06:39:52.958 --> 06:39:58.070 align:start position:0%
just the one bill
left

06:39:58.070 --> 06:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:00.590 --> 06:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay we we have Mark right there let's
 
06:40:04.350 --> 06:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:06.708 --> 06:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
mark thank you for putting your hand up
 
06:40:06.718 --> 06:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
mark thank you for putting your hand up
Mr

06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:16.070 --> 06:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
M good afternoon good afternoon Mark
 
06:40:17.548 --> 06:40:17.558 align:start position:0%
sorry to to drag on your meeting I know
 
06:40:19.070 --> 06:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
you've had a long day but um just want
 
06:40:20.468 --> 06:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
to clarify something that was discussed
 
06:40:22.830 --> 06:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
in the beginning um representative luno
 
06:40:24.628 --> 06:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
is correct that um
 
06:40:26.830 --> 06:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
there was efforts to get Senate Bill 135
 
06:40:28.910 --> 06:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the budget and that was unsuccessful
 
06:40:31.430 --> 06:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
was not put in the house budget um at
 
06:40:33.628 --> 06:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
that time but just want to clarify what
 
06:40:35.750 --> 06:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative lad was saying was the
 
06:40:38.270 --> 06:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
third grade reading looking back to 2019
 
06:40:40.190 --> 06:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
was put in House Bill too so the third
 
06:40:41.868 --> 06:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
grade reading fix was put in House Bill
 
06:40:43.548 --> 06:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
too that is in the house budget so I
 
06:40:46.430 --> 06:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to jump in and clarify that
 
06:40:47.788 --> 06:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
that's what I was trying to say that
 
06:40:50.150 --> 06:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
that amendment was put
 
06:40:52.708 --> 06:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
in not under that amendment number I
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
don't believe it was may have been a
 
06:40:57.910 --> 06:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
different you know Amendment correct no
 
06:41:01.070 --> 06:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
but that that's also that's also has a
 
06:41:04.030 --> 06:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
small sticker price you know on it
 
06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
compared to the other adma adjustments
 
06:41:11.190 --> 06:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
so okay Mark I have a question for you
 
06:41:15.468 --> 06:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you're here um we we received
 
06:41:19.670 --> 06:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
this uh estimated total education Aid uh
 
06:41:22.590 --> 06:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh sheet put out by
 
06:41:27.070 --> 06:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
LBA B basically uh uh uh March April
 
06:41:29.070 --> 06:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
excuse April
 
06:41:34.110 --> 06:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
2721 um and it shows fy22 FY 23 what the
 
06:41:36.150 --> 06:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
current law is what the house passed
 
06:41:39.190 --> 06:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
increases decreases have you seen in
 
06:41:42.070 --> 06:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
your department or do you have a
 
06:41:44.350 --> 06:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that shows the individual
 
06:41:46.150 --> 06:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
communities and shows the adequacy
 
06:41:50.070 --> 06:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
formula right across how all this was
 
06:41:54.990 --> 06:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
calculated so comparing current law um
 
06:41:57.190 --> 06:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I produced that document uh
 
06:41:58.628 --> 06:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
or I have a document a similar not the
 
06:42:00.750 --> 06:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
lb's document but a doe document I can
 
06:42:02.708 --> 06:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
look um to see what I have but when you
 
06:42:05.230 --> 06:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
look at current law which was that 922
 
06:42:07.230 --> 06:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
Million number and then you have the
 
06:42:09.670 --> 06:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
governor's um which in the governor's
 
06:42:11.468 --> 06:42:11.478 align:start position:0%
formula which is essentially house bill
 
06:42:14.628 --> 06:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
to was adopted um it's a $16 million
 
06:42:17.310 --> 06:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
increase over current law um I can I can
 
06:42:19.990 --> 06:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
produce that document okay see i' I've
 
06:42:22.350 --> 06:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
asked you know I got this quick look
 
06:42:25.868 --> 06:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
sheet but I was looking for the you know
 
06:42:28.430 --> 06:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
a more thorough uh spreadsheet which
 
06:42:30.788 --> 06:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
showed the you know is that possible if
 
06:42:33.388 --> 06:42:33.398 align:start position:0%
you have it to uh email a copy of that
 
06:42:35.910 --> 06:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
to members on the committee yep I think
 
06:42:37.270 --> 06:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
I think I have what you're looking for I
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
don't know if I exactly have it but I
 
06:42:41.150 --> 06:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
have I have something it might be yeah
 
06:42:44.110 --> 06:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
and and clarification on that two Mark
 
06:42:48.388 --> 06:42:48.398 align:start position:0%
current law is $90 million less than
 
06:42:51.708 --> 06:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
fy21 approximately approximately yes
 
06:42:54.388 --> 06:42:54.398 align:start position:0%
approximately current law 9 million less
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
than fy21 so this is you know this is
 
06:43:00.150 --> 06:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
money that um that that a lot of
 
06:43:01.510 --> 06:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
districts are going to have to make up
 
06:43:04.468 --> 06:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
for with local property taxes if is that
 
06:43:09.070 --> 06:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
including Dave the the onetime money yes
 
06:43:11.030 --> 06:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
and how much is that total up to about
 
06:43:14.110 --> 06:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
what about half of it yeah it's about
 
06:43:17.910 --> 06:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
50 $ 59 million something like that I
 
06:43:20.388 --> 06:43:20.398 align:start position:0%
rounded it off to 60 yeah
 
06:43:22.910 --> 06:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the difference between the
 
06:43:24.548 --> 06:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
two is you're talking talking $30
 
06:43:28.628 --> 06:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
million yeah that's the that's the adma
 
06:43:32.990 --> 06:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
the the the the um pandemic um uh
 
06:43:33.000 --> 06:43:35.590 align:start position:0%
the the the the um pandemic um uh
related

06:43:35.590 --> 06:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:38.548 --> 06:43:38.558 align:start position:0%
costs okay and how much money are we
 
06:43:41.628 --> 06:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
getting in are the towns getting in for
 
06:43:43.590 --> 06:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
the pandemic like from the federal
 
06:43:46.628 --> 06:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
government or wherever towards that
 
06:43:49.230 --> 06:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
30,000 only only the city I I think
 
06:43:51.310 --> 06:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
we've only seen that report for
 
06:43:54.468 --> 06:43:54.478 align:start position:0%
cities I don't think we've seen it for
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
um school districts or towns yet but I
 
06:44:00.350 --> 06:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
think or or it's just come
 
06:44:03.110 --> 06:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
out Mark do you do you
 
06:44:05.388 --> 06:44:05.398 align:start position:0%
have I have a document that we presented
 
06:44:07.430 --> 06:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
to house finance um it doesn't include
 
06:44:09.388 --> 06:44:09.398 align:start position:0%
all the allocations I think in total
 
06:44:11.708 --> 06:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
we're talking about $600 million in
 
06:44:13.910 --> 06:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal money coming in um we haven't
 
06:44:15.708 --> 06:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
done all of the dispersements and
 
06:44:17.590 --> 06:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
allocations but I can provide a document
 
06:44:19.708 --> 06:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
on that as
 
06:44:22.548 --> 06:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
well that'd be
 
06:44:26.628 --> 06:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
nice okay uh any other questions for
 
06:44:30.910 --> 06:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
Mark from doe works with
 
06:44:34.628 --> 06:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn thanks Mark for showing up thank
 
06:44:37.990 --> 06:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
you have a good afternoon you
 
06:44:42.110 --> 06:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
too okay uh so 135 we will discuss that
 
06:44:45.430 --> 06:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
one too uh uh we have one other bill
 
06:44:46.868 --> 06:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
06:44:49.230 --> 06:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
19 which is the Signum bill I don't
 
06:44:50.990 --> 06:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
think we need a long work session on
 
06:44:55.190 --> 06:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
that right now um the the house bill is
 
06:44:58.590 --> 06:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled at this point in
 
06:45:01.590 --> 06:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
time so there's basically I don't think
 
06:45:03.990 --> 06:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
we need to work on that at all
 
06:45:07.030 --> 06:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
no other words you know it the it's
 
06:45:10.750 --> 06:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen it's just now um govern
 
06:45:12.868 --> 06:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
sign yeah we're just probably most
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
likely itl the Signum bill
 
06:45:22.310 --> 06:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah alrighty any other points oh I also
 
06:45:26.868 --> 06:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
also um um while we have people
 
06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
here we have uh two Committee of
 
06:45:29.638 --> 06:45:32.670 align:start position:0%
here we have uh two Committee of
conference

06:45:32.670 --> 06:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:37.590 --> 06:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:40.628 --> 06:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
numbers that's so much paperwork on this
 
06:45:43.070 --> 06:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
desk I always spread out too
 
06:45:48.230 --> 06:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
much here they are nearest ones to me
 
06:45:50.628 --> 06:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
um HB
 
06:45:53.548 --> 06:45:53.558 align:start position:0%
320 requires a Civics competency
 
06:45:55.868 --> 06:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
assessment as high school graduation
 
06:45:59.110 --> 06:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
requirement so that has come back to us
 
06:46:01.708 --> 06:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
with an amended change the amendment is
 
06:46:04.590 --> 06:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
simply to change the effective date to
 
06:46:06.388 --> 06:46:06.398 align:start position:0%
July 1
 
06:46:09.868 --> 06:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
2023 everything else in it remained the
 
06:46:15.350 --> 06:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
same uh it's the effective date July 1
 
06:46:15.360 --> 06:46:18.548 align:start position:0%
same uh it's the effective date July 1
2023

06:46:18.548 --> 06:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:22.190 --> 06:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
um what I have to do is I will I have to
 
06:46:25.350 --> 06:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
get a uh a poll actually the chairman of
 
06:46:26.868 --> 06:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
the committee can make a decision but
 
06:46:28.230 --> 06:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
I've always worked with committee
 
06:46:31.070 --> 06:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
members and try to get a reasonable
 
06:46:33.388 --> 06:46:33.398 align:start position:0%
understanding where committee is on it
 
06:46:35.110 --> 06:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
and then to make a decision whether
 
06:46:38.548 --> 06:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to concur non-c concur or
 
06:46:41.670 --> 06:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
non-c Concur and request a committee of
 
06:46:43.948 --> 06:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
conference and then we appoint members
 
06:46:45.590 --> 06:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
to that Committee of
 
06:46:48.788 --> 06:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
conference um so that's the first one it
 
06:46:48.798 --> 06:46:50.628 align:start position:0%
conference um so that's the first one it
was

06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:46:55.430 --> 06:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
320 uh the the second bill is HB
 
06:46:58.150 --> 06:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
432 relative to the offenses that
 
06:47:00.948 --> 06:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
prevent employment in a
 
06:47:02.910 --> 06:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
school and there
 
06:47:07.150 --> 06:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
were uh some significant changes to this
 
06:47:09.830 --> 06:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill so uh what I'm going to do is I'm
 
06:47:12.990 --> 06:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
gonna get this and send it out to you
 
06:47:16.150 --> 06:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
and read it over then I will be polling
 
06:47:18.670 --> 06:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
people to find out you know where we
 
06:47:21.548 --> 06:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
stand on these two bills uh I want to
 
06:47:23.350 --> 06:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
get these Committee of conference going
 
06:47:24.468 --> 06:47:24.478 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have more bills
 
06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
coming in from the Senate and we're
 
06:47:29.670 --> 06:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to get all this business
 
06:47:31.230 --> 06:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
here so look for these two bills I'll be
 
06:47:36.830 --> 06:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
sending you 320 and
 
06:47:41.868 --> 06:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
432 Rick can I ask a question yeah um so
 
06:47:45.430 --> 06:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh 4:32 I was actually present during
 
06:47:49.750 --> 06:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
that Senate uh hearing and exec session
 
06:47:52.468 --> 06:47:52.478 align:start position:0%
y so I I know about the changes to that
 
06:47:54.110 --> 06:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
06:47:57.750 --> 06:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
um what's what's our timeline on this
 
06:48:01.670 --> 06:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
like when when do you see us making
 
06:48:04.468 --> 06:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
decisions on this will we discuss this
 
06:48:09.070 --> 06:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
before uh decisions are made the the way
 
06:48:10.190 --> 06:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
we've always done Committee of
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
conferences before we usually are in the
 
06:48:14.430 --> 06:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
hall you pull people down to one section
 
06:48:16.788 --> 06:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
or area of it you explain it and a
 
06:48:19.270 --> 06:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
decision's made right there uh We've
 
06:48:20.670 --> 06:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
also done it the other way where we've
 
06:48:23.430 --> 06:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
discussed them in committee um most
 
06:48:25.590 --> 06:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
likely on this one I will poll everybody
 
06:48:27.708 --> 06:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
or try to get together with everybody at
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
a time and and we can explain them and
 
06:48:32.388 --> 06:48:32.398 align:start position:0%
and then a recommendation can come
 
06:48:34.868 --> 06:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
forward to me and then I make a
 
06:48:39.190 --> 06:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the the speaker um
 
06:48:42.110 --> 06:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
once the if we decide to concur it's
 
06:48:45.948 --> 06:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
done it goes on to the the governor uh
 
06:48:50.270 --> 06:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
if we non-c concur then the the or
 
06:48:52.670 --> 06:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me concur if we concur it goes to
 
06:48:56.030 --> 06:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
to the the house floor for a vote and
 
06:48:57.548 --> 06:48:57.558 align:start position:0%
you'll if you've been in the house
 
06:48:59.310 --> 06:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
before you know that there's a whole
 
06:49:02.670 --> 06:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
Litany of these bills a myriad of bills
 
06:49:05.388 --> 06:49:05.398 align:start position:0%
and we have just go down quickly and do
 
06:49:07.388 --> 06:49:07.398 align:start position:0%
the voice votes usually sometimes it's a
 
06:49:10.310 --> 06:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
roll call vote non-c concur is the same
 
06:49:12.830 --> 06:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
issue uh it goes before the house non-c
 
06:49:14.430 --> 06:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
Concur and request Committee of
 
06:49:17.150 --> 06:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
conference when you do that then we have
 
06:49:18.510 --> 06:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference and then
 
06:49:21.430 --> 06:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
that comes back to the uh the Full House
 
06:49:23.468 --> 06:49:23.478 align:start position:0%
with that recommendation or can be
 
06:49:25.070 --> 06:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
killed other words you know we don't
 
06:49:26.230 --> 06:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
agree with the senate or the Senate
 
06:49:27.948 --> 06:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree with us I've been in a
 
06:49:29.830 --> 06:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
number of those I was in one Committee
 
06:49:31.230 --> 06:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
of the conference dealing with one of
 
06:49:33.590 --> 06:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
the issues years ago and we we went
 
06:49:35.430 --> 06:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
through 30 amendments in the committee
 
06:49:38.150 --> 06:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
of conference and end up killing the
 
06:49:41.110 --> 06:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
bill nobody could agree
 
06:49:44.628 --> 06:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's it's a process which can
 
06:49:47.788 --> 06:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
be very interesting but time taking we
 
06:49:49.830 --> 06:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
have to have this done commit of
 
06:49:52.030 --> 06:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
conference period starts generally
 
06:49:56.110 --> 06:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
speaking couple weeks before um the last
 
06:49:57.708 --> 06:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
session because she got to act on this
 
06:50:00.110 --> 06:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
stuff and the committee conferences all
 
06:50:01.910 --> 06:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
have to be scheduled during that time
 
06:50:05.948 --> 06:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
they out all the rooms in the L for
 
06:50:07.590 --> 06:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
committee of conferences and nothing
 
06:50:09.030 --> 06:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
else goes
 
06:50:13.190 --> 06:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
on so all right well I'm happy to answer
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
any questions if anybody has them about
 
06:50:21.590 --> 06:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
4:32 as I said I was there so uh if
 
06:50:24.628 --> 06:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
anybody qu reads it and looks through it
 
06:50:26.990 --> 06:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
and says how are these two things
 
06:50:29.230 --> 06:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
related or whatever I mean I'm happy to
 
06:50:32.230 --> 06:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
answer those questions okay generally
 
06:50:34.190 --> 06:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
speaking when a committee of conference
 
06:50:35.670 --> 06:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
is developed the chair will appoint
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
members to it there's one member that
 
06:50:40.750 --> 06:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
will be appointed from the uh minority
 
06:50:44.270 --> 06:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
Democratic party usually and most
 
06:50:46.590 --> 06:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
importantly the chair will look for some
 
06:50:49.510 --> 06:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the voted positively for the
 
06:50:52.270 --> 06:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
bill um I've seen where members of the
 
06:50:53.750 --> 06:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee conference have been kicked
 
06:50:58.468 --> 06:50:58.478 align:start position:0%
off um uh you know of the committee of
 
06:51:01.750 --> 06:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
conference not literally but yeah like
 
06:51:03.990 --> 06:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh oh you better warn me about that Rick
 
06:51:06.830 --> 06:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
because I could be one of those people I
 
06:51:09.190 --> 06:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
can remember when when the Republicans
 
06:51:11.948 --> 06:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
were in the minority and we had some
 
06:51:13.788 --> 06:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
folks that would not agree to the
 
06:51:16.350 --> 06:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
finance report and they were kicked off
 
06:51:19.628 --> 06:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
and you know and so it happens both ways
 
06:51:23.548 --> 06:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
so we won't literally do that
 
06:51:25.110 --> 06:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
all right and I promise I'll keep my
 
06:51:27.430 --> 06:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
sense of humor in
 
06:51:32.670 --> 06:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
check good good that Manchester humor
 
06:51:35.430 --> 06:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
right okay so I think that takes us
 
06:51:37.190 --> 06:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
through everything for
 
06:51:40.990 --> 06:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
today anything else we're gonna have to
 
06:51:43.670 --> 06:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
wake Ralph up over
 
06:51:46.388 --> 06:51:46.398 align:start position:0%
there he's already out the
 
06:51:48.948 --> 06:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
door so thank you very much and we'll
 
06:51:50.830 --> 06:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
call it quits today and if you get some
 
06:51:52.230 --> 06:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
amending language please get it to
 
06:51:53.388 --> 06:51:53.398 align:start position:0%
everybody as soon as
