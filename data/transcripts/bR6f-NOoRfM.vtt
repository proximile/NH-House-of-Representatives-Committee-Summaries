1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Share of the cost sharing that still needs to come up.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.000
That's not a lended amount.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
That's not part of this.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Basically the last paragraph takes care of the case where the two numbers don't match at the end and then the town actually owes more than what's anticipated.

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.000
That has to be repaid and that's what that paragraph does.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Correct.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If I'm sorry.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Oh please go ahead.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Sorry.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:55.500
The Senate Finance Committee added this paragraph D just to clarify that the full amount of whatever is lended would come back to the state, that this would be a zero-sum game for the state.

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
This wouldn't be a grant program.

12
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.000
This is purely a lended and borrowed and paid back program.

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The terms of negotiation, and this is where Representative Lynn know, is asking questions about this, and I think it would be limited to just the timing of the payments, you know?

14
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So if it's not forgiveness of any of the amount, unless you deleted that first sentence of paragraph D, subparagraph D, or interest, because the way this bill's written, there's no interest.

15
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.500
So it's really just the timeline of when that difference would get paid back, which in theory shouldn't exist if the estimates were done well.

16
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Well, but you know what?

17
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.500
That's not the way that the senator— Representative Lynn, did you want to say something?

18
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
May I be heard?

20
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
Thank you.

21
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.000
That doesn't—that's not the way the senator—I'm sorry, I'm forgetting her name now.

22
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.500
But Prentice, that's not the way she interpreted it.

23
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:28.500
I mean, she sort of said that it would be a question of whether it all had to be paid back or something less than all.

24
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:38.500
And it does seem like the DRA rule basically says if there's a dispute, the town loses in the end.

25
00:02:38.500 --> 00:03:10.000
And that's kind of why I proposed that language, because if they really do get to loggerheads and they can't come to an agreement, then, you know, I mean, the way it is now, what would happen is the town would lose if under the language I proposed, they could go to court and the court would decide what's fair under the circumstances.

26
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Maybe the town would collect the whole thing.

27
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.500
I mean maybe the town would have to pay back the whole thing.

28
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Maybe it wouldn't.

29
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500
It would depend on the circumstances.

30
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:41.500
And we could you could amend this bill to to make it so the state wouldn't always be entitled I guess if you will or required to to get the amount back.

31
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:59.500
I'll just point out on subparagraph D and this was an intent of the bill as passed recipients of the exceptional disaster relief loan shall be responsible to pay the entire loan amount to the state.

32
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:08.500
This wasn't designed to have a mechanism that the municipality would ever pay back less than it borrowed.

33
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:34.000
If you wanted to open this up that that could be you know if in the event the municipality's reimbursement from FEMA was less than it's borrowed and you want to have a mechanism for forgiveness, I think that would require a further amendment than what's in front of you now.

34
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Representative Petrie.

35
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.500
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.

36
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500
I get a question.

37
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:56.500
Now, are we talking about the day before status of the roads or whatever bridges or the mitigated, in other words, up to a repair where it's going to, or mitigated repair?

38
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.000
I don't have the answer to that.

39
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:14.500
That would be something we would want to speak to the Homeland Security Emergency Management folks as far as the definitions of allowable costs or those sorts of things.

40
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.000
Because that was mentioned, but I don't think they really specified.

41
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I do know that they've got mitigation funds available for the communities.

42
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.500
I would think this whole area should be applying for mitigation funds because if they don't, it's going to happen again.

43
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.000
It's going to happen again.

44
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.500
And I think, you know, they mentioned Alstead, which was a total disaster.

45
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.000
And FEMA provided mitigation funds.

46
00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:08.500
So I guess that if it was up to me, I would add something in here that says, if you are facing this kind of a disaster, then you need to apply for mitigation funds so that it doesn't happen again.

47
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:25.500
You know, I don't know what, you know, I don't know how to word that, but I do feel that, you know, sometimes, you know, the flood happens, okay, it's over, and that's it.

48
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.500
Thank you.

49
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.500
towns, you know, the flood happens.

50
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.500
Okay, it's over, and that's it.

51
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.500
So, if I may.

52
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Go ahead.

53
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.500
So, this is a separate fund?

54
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500
This 409 is a separate fund?

55
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.000
It's not this mitigated program that you're talking about?

56
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.500
No, the mitigation funds are FEMA money.

57
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.500
Oh, that's strictly FEMA.

58
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.500
Yeah.

59
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.500
Okay.

60
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:05.500
And we talked about it when we were dealing with 1665, but that's just my feeling.

61
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500
So, Kate, I'm sorry, Representative Murray.

62
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500
Thank you.

63
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:38.500
Yeah, this sounds like it's just to get the ball rolling so that you can get money, and it sounds like it should function as a pass-through almost so that there's no difference in the amount of money of what you get for the loan and what's going to come in and it just passes back.

64
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:57.000
But the way I read this or my understanding of it is that this is to get funds to the community as quickly as possible, knowing the money's going to come back in and just pass through.

65
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So that seemed to be, that's my understanding of the goal of this, which is why I like the simplicity of it.

66
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.500
And I guess I don't know how to fit in your comments with mitigation money.

67
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:27.500
That seems like that's a little bit further down the road and that this is to get money to the communities to start work.

68
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.500
It seems to be the critical hiccup here.

69
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:49.000
I guess the only thing that I would say is that if a community is approved for this type of loan, then following something or other, you know, that mitigation funds must be applied for.

70
00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:04.500
And if you receive mitigation or if you don't receive mitigation funds or whatever, if you don't apply for it and this happens again, then you're not eligible for this anymore.

71
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.500
I'd go for that.

72
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:14.000
You know, I mean, obviously that's very crude, but I know Mickey can fix it.

73
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Okay, yes.

74
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.500
Just quickly, this expedites the process, but does it expedite it fast enough?

75
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.500
That's my question to Senator Prentice.

76
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:42.000
Again, we have that two-week window where the governor can't just on the spot say, I'm gonna be here and I'm gonna bring money with me so you can start fixing things tomorrow.

77
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
You know you're gonna have at least a two-week window.

78
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Do we wanna put in anything about some kind of flexibility for the governor and GNC?

79
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:07.500
Or maybe I'm just over, it just seems to me like what you went through, that if they had had some immediate, an immediate resource.

80
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.500
Yeah, they did.

81
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.500
Okay, it wasn't like they were left high and dry.

82
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.500
The state provided, I don't know what, anyhow, temporary assistance.

83
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.500
Okay.

84
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
So everything's covered then?

85
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.500
I think so.

86
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500
All right.

87
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:38.500
You know, maybe it wasn't as much as they wanted, but the state did at least help in some, to some degree.

88
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.500
And of course, the state was responsible for all the state roads.

89
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.000
The problem is not the state roads.

90
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The problem are the town roads.

91
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.500
And whether or not they were, you know, whatever.

92
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500
Please, go ahead.

93
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.500
Thank you.

94
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.000
Can I ask Representative Aaron?

95
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Of course.

96
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I mean, two weeks isn't a very long time, and at some point you have the disaster, but it's still going to take a little bit of time to figure out what needs to be done to triage the situation.

97
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And it seems like within the two-week, that may well, you know, be within a two-week period, and then you've got plenty of time for the next Governor's meeting to come up.

98
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.500
So was it, you know, as a two-week, did you, you know what I'm asking?

99
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.500
Thank you.

100
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500
Thank you.

101
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.500
Thank you so much.

102
00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:10.500
And to your question, what happened immediately after this flooding hit us was, of course, we had our own municipal emergency management team go out and take a look at what was going on.

103
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:24.500
And they were able to determine, and they worked with our local EMTs because we needed to make sure that we could get to where people needed us.

104
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:40.000
So they went through and they did a quick assessment of what roads were open, which ones were damaged, which ones had to get signage to close them and so forth.

105
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And of course meeting with the select board.

106
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.500
But to your question, then, we, in terms of getting immediate funding, we had money in our fund balance.

107
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500
We had $450,000, $550,000.

108
00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:12.000
So they knew that they at least had a small pot of money to be able to use or tap into right away in order to get roads open with gravel and whatever.

109
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.500
We also contacted Homeland Security Emergency Management and Department of Transportation and started to work with them.

110
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:32.500
I know the commissioner of the Department of Transportation, Victoria Sheehan, right away diverted a lot of resources to that part of the state.

111
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:41.000
So we were able to get Jersey barriers, we were able to get signs, road clothes signs.

112
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
They couldn't give us trucks or gravel or any of that kind of thing.

113
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But we had a certain limited amount of resources that we were able to tap into.

114
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So I guess the two weeks is manageable, I think.

115
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I mean, unless there's something even more horrendous that could happen to a municipality other than total washout of floods.

116
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.500
So, yeah, I think that that's doable.

117
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.000
Mickey, I have a question.

118
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.500
As you know, I DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE FISCAL OUT OF MONEY SPENDING.

119
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:30.500
SO DOES ANY PLACE IN THIS SAY THAT FISCAL DOESN'T NEED TO BE INVOLVED?

120
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:45.000
IT DOESN'T EXPLICITLY SAY FISCAL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED, BUT THE CURRENT LOAN PROGRAM, THE WAY IT'S IN THE STATUTE NOW, IT'S JUST A GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL PROCESS.

121
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.500
SO THEY CAN SPEND OUR MONEY EVEN IF WE DON'T WANT THEM TO?

122
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.000
THEY CAN SPEND IT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S EXPECTED BACK.

123
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
THIS IS WHY THERE'S NO FISCAL NOTE ON THIS BILL.

124
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
THIS IS A NET ZERO PROGRAM.

125
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.500
So this is expected to be returned.

126
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:17.500
If it's lended, it's a receivable and it will be paid back in whatever the timeline of the.

127
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.500
Okay.

128
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:30.000
So if the governor and council wants to forgive any of this, then it would have to come back to fiscal?

129
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:45.500
Currently, the way the bill came to you, there is no forgiveness mechanism, and there would be no fiscal, there's no mechanism here for forgiveness in the way I read it.

130
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.500
So the expectation would be a net zero.

131
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:58.500
Because you can't, if you forgive, then you can't get FEMA money, is what I heard them say.

132
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.500
Okay.

133
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500
All right.

134
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500
So, okay.

135
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500
Go ahead.

136
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.500
They did the original text of the legislation had fiscal.

137
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:20.500
So it was the Senate that amended it to take fiscal out and put it in government council.

138
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:27.500
So we can always change it if that's something that we want to do.

139
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:37.500
I will say that the Senate added it as new language and just reverted it back to the existing language.

140
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:43.000
So it's always been, fiscal's never been part of this program.

141
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And I think just, and I'll just point out as far as concerns about timing and expediting the process, GNC does meet more routinely than fiscal does too.

142
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And I think FISCAL DOES, TOO.

143
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON SENATE FINANCE DIDN'T WANT TO ADD AN EXTRA APPROVAL PROCESS.

144
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
FISCAL WILL MEET ON A DIME.

145
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I'M SORRY.

146
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.500
I SAID ON A DIM.

147
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.500
OKAY.

148
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.500
YES, GO AHEAD.

149
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.500
THANK YOU, MADRIC CHAIR.

150
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.000
I HAD A QUESTION FOR REPRESENTATIVE AARON.

151
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.500
HOW MUCH DID YOU HAVE IN YOUR CAPITAL RESERVE FUND FOR YOUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND WHATEVER?

152
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:44.500
We had a bridge fund that had, I want to say, reserve fund for your roads and bridges and whatever?

153
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:56.000
We had a bridge fund that had, I want to say, I think it was $90,000 that we had saved for our bridges.

154
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.500
It was a bridge fund.

155
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:15.500
And the bridge on Forest Road, we had a temporary deck put on there a couple of years ago because the bridge was red-listed and we didn't have enough money to replace the bridge.

156
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:21.000
So best we could do was put this slab on top.

157
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Well, this flood washed away all of the material that was underneath the slab.

158
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:39.500
So it's a culvert, and it had material on top, and then they had the slab, and all that material was washed away.

159
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:50.500
So we were able to tap in $60,000, I think it was, to blow in material underneath to shore up that decking.

160
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:59.500
So we were able to use that from our capital reserve fund that we had for the bridge.

161
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:12.000
And the reason why we only had $90,000 in that fund was because we had recently replaced a bridge elsewhere in town two years prior.

162
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So we were building up that fund again.

163
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
WE DID OF COUR, have other funds for road repair set aside.

164
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:44.000
We do have capital reserve funds, but with a town of 850 people and limited taxing ability, because we have certainly other projects and things going on that we have to pay for, It's a slow accumulation of funds in these capital reserve funds.

165
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.500
So we used whatever we had in our savings to deal with that.

166
00:19:50.500 --> 00:20:08.000
And now this very same bridge, this Forest Road Bridge, we've just gotten notice from the state that if we don't have a plan in place to replace the entire bridge, they will close it.

167
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:29.000
So now we're scrambling around in town to try and figure out how we can, well, to first of all get a plan in place and how we are going to get the money available to do this to replace this bridge.

168
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:52.500
We are thinking that perhaps this might be a FEMA reimbursable project, but they are now balking at the RFP process and the engineer that's working on it, and there's all kinds of complications about, you know, why FEMA may not help us with this at all.

169
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.500
Okay.

170
00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:00.500
Mickey, I know you have answers to every question I ever ask.

171
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:07.000
How much do these small towns receive in municipal bridge and road aid?

172
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
So we have a State Aid Bridge Program.

173
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
That's to repair.

174
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.500
That's a matching program, 80-20.

175
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:22.500
And that's, we have a reoccurrence of $6.8 million a year for that program.

176
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:31.500
As far as just highway block grant aid, that's in the ballpark of $34, $35 million a year.

177
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.500
That's the apportionment A that we refer to.

178
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:45.000
Those are the two programs that jump out at the top of my head right now for such things.

179
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Okay.

180
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So can the bridge aid be targeted, or is that just, or I mean the town just has to come up with a 20.

181
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.500
Yeah, it's there's a, there's a queue.

182
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.500
There's a list, I think, uh, for projects.

183
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:13.000
And I think it's part of the 10 year plan project as well.

184
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And I'm not sure how far out we are at this point with it.

185
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.500
I haven't got an update on that for a, for a little bit for myself.

186
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:39.000
So it would make sense that for this bridge, they go to the 10-year plan and see if they can get it updated?

187
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Yeah.

188
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:50.000
If it's something that town wanted to apply for bridge aid, they certainly could go through that process.

189
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Yeah.

190
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Well.

191
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Yeah.

192
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:17.000
And I will, I mean, there is another bill, I think it was referred to criminal justice and public safety that has a $36 million appropriation to the state bridge program and another $30 million for the apportionment A program as well.

193
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So there's another piece of legislation with funding for those two programs.

194
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Okay.

195
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
May I make a comment on?

196
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You can say whatever you want.

197
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
We're very open here.

198
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Thank you.

199
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.500
Remember I told you the Forest Road Bridge, which is the bottom of my driveway.

200
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.500
The Forest Road Bridge, we put a slab on top.

201
00:23:47.500 --> 00:24:02.500
The reason we did it that way was because we had originally went to the road and bridge fund, where they, you know, it's the 80-20 match kind of thing.

202
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:26.000
And we had gotten an estimate from the state, and the state had their engineers come up with this plan that was going to cost the town, I think, two and a half million dollars to put a bridge over this, to put a new bridge in.

203
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:36.500
And certainly we had no, we didn't have the resources to meet even the match that this program would have required.

204
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.500
Plus, the waiting list on this program was quite long.

205
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:55.000
and um so the town came up with this other way to fix this, which was to put a slab over, which only cost us about $60,000.

206
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:08.000
So we felt that this temporary fix was going to get us through until we could save money to actually do an actual bridge repair replacement.

207
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:25.500
And that's the problem that these smaller towns have, is that they just don't have the resources to do the work that either the state is recommending us do or that has to be done.

208
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:40.000
It just takes a long time to accumulate the funds to be able to do these kinds of things in the proper way that they're supposed to be done.

209
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
So that's what happened.

210
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
All right.

211
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.500
If I'm hearing everybody, we have no problem with this bill except for a couple of amendments.

212
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.500
Is that correct?

213
00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:02.000
I have no problem with everything except I still have a question on line 7.

214
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.500
Maybe Mickey has the answer.

215
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:10.000
The rest of it I think should stay as is myself.

216
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I still have questions about the anticipated assistance.

217
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:26.500
She described it as nine months to a year before FEMA would have an idea of how much that is, yet we're talking two weeks.

218
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:36.000
So who makes under this, and I know this is existing language, who now makes the anticipated assistance assessment?

219
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:50.000
I think this is a question best for Homeland Security and emergency management, but I know it's part of the initial preliminary assessing of the damage they do.

220
00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:20.500
And I think Fallon did point out that subparagraph C, where it's kind of an extra guardrail in there to really try to hone in on, I don't know if conservative is the right thing, but really try to ensure whatever the amount of this loan is, there's a very good expectation that it would be covered under a FEMA reimbursement.

221
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.000
Which is exactly my point or concern.

222
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:54.000
If, I mean, I'm fine with the bill as it is, but as I read this bill, I'm looking at a very long timeline before this becomes eligible, which, again, I don't personally have a problem with, but if the majority here is thinking that this is something that's going to be done in weeks, I don't see that happening.

223
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I would say that FEMA does, FEMA, the state FEMA, if that's the right term, that's probably the wrong term, comes in and does a preliminary assessment to say that we anticipate, what did they say, 6 million?

224
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
18 million?

225
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
18.

226
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Yeah.

227
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
That that was their preliminary assessment.

228
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.500
And so, okay, but it doesn't matter.

229
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.500
That gives the towns a anticipated assistance amount.

230
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.000
So I mean, that is all done.

231
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:44.000
I mean, when the Saco overflowed and destroyed a bunch of stuff up there, the preliminary assessment was done within a week.

232
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:53.500
And so whether the governor and council can put it on the agenda the following week, I don't know.

233
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.000
But that's up to them.

234
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:10.500
And I don't know if you guys are all, if you're good with it, would there be a way to clarify that anticipated assistance by, as determined by X?

235
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:19.500
And I don't know who the department, to me it's just open ended and it's kind of vague.

236
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.500
Yeah, that's me.

237
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:48.000
I can find out from the department if that, that may be a federally defined term, you know, so that anticipated assistance may be, may have a definition behind it that I just don't know right now that could help this conversation, but I can reach out to them and get more info.

238
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.500
And other than that particular two words, I'm good with the rest of the bill.

239
00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:02.500
Just a question about, um, commissioner Sheehan was at your side, bringing resources immediately.

240
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:27.000
Does there need to be any clarification or Mickey, do we have a law already in place that gives her that authority to act or that state services are, the governor has the authority once he declares an emergency that he releases the support systems that would be available.

241
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
But it sounds like Victoria Sullivan even got their, Victoria, no, no.

242
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Sheehan.

243
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Oh, my God.

244
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You can tell too much in my life.

245
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Victoria Sheehan.

246
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
That was bad.

247
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
So she acted to get you some support right away.

248
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.500
I think that part of the disaster planning that...

249
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.500
That's in there.

250
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.500
That's all in there.

251
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.500
Perfect.

252
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.500
Okay.

253
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.500
Good.

254
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.000
You know, and it's managed by the Homeland, Jennifer and Fallon.

255
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.500
It's managed by that, just like Perry Plummer used to do.

256
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.500
One further question.

257
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:25.000
Now we've got another bill coming, 402, that I guess deals with the same content.

258
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.500
I'll tell you what 402 is if you want.

259
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:36.500
SB 402 is a bill that was put forth, I believe by Senator Kahn.

260
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:46.000
And what that sought to do was to take that 25% FEMA match and make half of it shareable.

261
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:56.500
The state picks up 12.5% and the municipality picks up 12.5% so that the municipality's not responsible for the whole 25%.

262
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:14.000
And I think, and what happened was that got stalled in the Senate Finance Committee because New Hampshire Homeland Security Emergency Management could not tell them how much 12.5% represented in dollars for the state.

263
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.500
Well, I think they passed that through.

264
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.000
I think it is coming over here.

265
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And I think they may have changed it to say that no matter what the match is, the state picks up half.

266
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
It just seems like we have a lot of these bills in.

267
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
They're interconnected.

268
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.500
Would it be nice to look at them as a package?

269
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.500
Yeah.

270
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:53.500
But the problem, when are all the bills due for second committee?

271
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.500
I don't have my schedule here.

272
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.500
I thought it was April 14.

273
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.500
No?

274
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.500
I think you're right.

275
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:14.500
And then those will go to the floor the following week, except that's when we have to have all our bills done.

276
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:23.000
So I'm not sure if these would be considered bills going to a second committee or not.

277
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I don't know if there would be a second committee for either of these.

278
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:43.500
The deadline for bills to report bills going to a second committee is the 14th, and the last day to report on all bills is the 28th.

279
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.500
Yeah, because ours are due on the 28th.

280
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.000
These bills are due on the 28th.

281
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
And I'll just clarify.

282
00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.500
So Senate Bill 402 started as the state sharing that cost share with the municipalities.

283
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:33.000
Senate Finance did amend to create a essentially a new mechanism for the governor with fiscal and governor council or and council approval to draw on funds not otherwise appropriated to provide disaster assistance to municipalities so somewhat similar to the civil emergency that's in law now but this is really just targeted for fema related disasters not necessarily the declaration of a civil emergency.

284
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
So they created an easier pathway for response for situations like this.

285
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Okay.

286
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
All right.

287
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:55.500
So, Mickey, you don't have to rush too fast on the amendments to this because we don't have any other bills other than this one.

288
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.000
And it's not due till the 28th.

289
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:10.000
We'll just, you know, I mean, if we could get it in by the 14th, we could, but we don't have to.

290
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
So.

291
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I mean, if we could get it in by the 14th, we could, but we don't have to.

292
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
So I don't know what people's schedules are.

293
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
I've got a, we're gonna have a pre-fiscal on Wednesday the 13th.

294
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
And I haven't set a time for that.

295
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.500
We've got an issue, but does the 13th sound like it might work?

296
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.500
Thank you.

297
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.000
sound like it might work.

298
00:35:46.000 --> 00:36:44.500
So I will, I'm waiting to hear from HHS on something, because they want to come and brief us on the Hampstead Hospital so we'll figure all that out so here can I just raise it so am I understanding correctly then that the the set the consensus is that subsection D as it's written now requires the repayment of the whole loan under any circumstances and that we should leave that in because if we take if we try to take that out there'll be some we might be jeopardizing the FEMA money so is that everybody's okay so then forget about my language that we don't need that yeah we can't we can FEMA MONEY.

299
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.500
I GUESS WE COULD.

300
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:53.500
ANYHOW, I WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT TIME ON WHATEVER DAY THAT IS, THE 13TH.

301
00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:00.000
I AGREE WITH REPRESENTATIVE TURKOT YET AGAIN OF BEING COMPLETELY FINE WITH THIS.

302
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:13.000
I'M HERE ON WEDNESDAY LATE IN THE DAY IF THAT MATTER that matters to anybody, as opposed to, let's not meet at nine in the morning.

303
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.500
Actually, the afternoon would be better for me that day, too.

304
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.500
By the way, I don't set nine o'clock meetings, okay?

305
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.000
So, yeah, I'll see what works out.

306
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000
But like 2 o'clock or 2.30 or something like that would be.

Okay.

308
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.500
So I'll look at that, see what, you know, mesh all that together.
